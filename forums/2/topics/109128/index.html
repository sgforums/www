            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Retroguy,<br><br>Noticed in all your choices you are very particular about looks. Well, if looks factor so much in your decision I say you anyhow pick one that looks good will do... After all, looks will fade and soon you will find yourself forking out another sum of money to change to another car that looks better so make your decision snappy. You will change car very soon anyway...  because it's a matter of time you get tired of the looks of the car that you chose; especially NO manufacturer will produce cars that will look much worse than its precessors without added functionality... Balance your budget with practicality.<br>You can guess the car i'm driving from my nickname and personally I will recommend you to go for VIOS if budget and all rounder performance is what you are looking for. I did not choose VIOS mainly because I was very particular about FC and spaciousness which City scores very well in this aspect over VIOS. Looks, as i said, are superficial. I had no intention to change to another car when I get tired of the looks. Current City's looks is one that will never be desired from Day 1 you pick up the car from the agent. So looks will be the last thing that's on my mind. But till this day to name one serious competitor in terms of beating the City in FC and spaciousness I can think of none at the current pricing. It's cousin Jazz can beat the City in FC but at a premium thats out of your budget so forget it.<br><br>Having looks at the last department of consideration might also just worked to your advantage because what matters the most are the other benefits that you can extract from the investment you made. Personally I see no point in top speed or pick up performance because all these are useless in a country where traffic lights seems to be nearer to one other than Bus stops are to each other! And also 2 consecutive flashes from the traffic light camera will send you back to the driving theory classes again. Additionally we are in a country where the government and the petrol companies insistingly deny that a cartel is at work yet petrol prices not only remained sky high but also remained consistent amongst all the petrol companies! But we can't do anything about it when we buy a car except to rely less on the need to pump petrol. Either you carefully plan your route or you buy a car with good FC. In City, you can accomplish both. Think long term my friend.<br><br>My ultimate advise to you if you are going for good looks: Everything ages and depending on looks will get you nowhere. If you feel that you can easily change car after tiring of the looks of your car in 2~3 years then you are loaded. And if you are loaded then this discussion thread is a waste of everybody's time.... Else if you are not loaded and really on a budget, think long term and think practical. We live in a pragmatic society so be realistic in your choice. Good looks only last in fairy tales and since we don't live next to Cinderella or are neighbours with Alice in wonderland I say we better reprioritize whats important and whats not when we buy a car. After such a long essay, all's just my 2c worth. Remember its wiser to do car budgetting every 10 years rather than every few years. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Not sure what the diff between your's and other's basis of comparision, but you may wanna double check on the figures, esp with local owners on local conditions, and if your figures are based on maufacturer's claims.<br><br>Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo Joe Legal,<br><br>I agreed with what you said about drawing a line between looks and performance. No doubt being typical Singaporeans we would still more or less prefer "you-pi, you-qi, you TLN" kinda of attitude when buying things, especially such priced item.. Ok looks aside, perhaps I can help a bit on the technological front for the engines of the 5 cars Retro named and perhaps that might helped him a bit:<br><br>1. Mit Lancer: Mit had ditched the fuel-saving GDi engines for this new facelift model. It's no secret among the Mit community that GDi engines require sulphur-free petrol which can be found in Japan but not here. Over extended peiod of usage with sulphur-leaded petrol will cause clogging in the engine system that contributes to many earlier 1.8 &amp; 2.0 GDi Galants having idling problems on top of their already problematic GearBox (Now you know why GDi Galants are depreciating at 1.5/1.6L car's rate?) Currently it uses the GLXi engine which dates back to the design of Mit Lancer of '93. Basically this is an old engine in terms of technology but it is also a proven one. Proven becos they used it in Protons as well. Wira had been in production for the last 1 decade and so this engine really speaks for itself. FC around 12~13km/L. Ex-GDis managed 14~15km/L.  Only problem is that Mit motor is in deep shit recently so whoever buys Mits have to take calculated risk that it dun collapse else they can forget about the resale value of the cars liao...<br><br>2. T. Vios: Touted by many motor magazines as the best all rounder in the compact car segment. Nominated as the compact car winner for both consecutive years for '03 and '04 by Wheels Magazine. Volume on the road speaks for itself. Uses the VVTi engine. Helps you save on the timing belt charges cos' that's no need to change. FC can goes up to 13~14km/L for Autogear in certain cases. Recent recall affected all batches of VIOS but problem doesn't lie in engine so out of this scope of discussion. Rumour has it that Altis will soon be withdrawn in favor of japanese corollas again due to the thin profit margin (Altis's profit margin is only ard 6k as compared to Vios's 10k) and high maintenance cost on the Distributor's side. Will Vios be affected as well? How true are the allegations? Only time will tell...<br><br>3. K. Cerato: Replacement for outgoing model Spectra which was recently labelled by English papers as the worst model to protect occupants in the event of a head-on collision. Uses Kia's DOHC 16V engine that pumps out 105 horses.  Korean cars are already good drinkers (My friend drives a Rio1.3L(A), he gets only 10~11km/L); coupled them to a DOHC engines and you will never be amazed nor amused at how frequent you need to visit the kiosk. If you are looking for good FC, look elsewhere. However, at this kind of price for a 1.6L with reasonable amenities thrown in, Cerato may be a good steal afterall....<br><br>4. N. Sunny: Uses the improved OQ16DE engine with electronic engine throttle. Basically a facelifted model of the engine series used in this model that appear on the road after 1999. That time, Singaporeans were buying Sunny as fast as they clear Toyotas off the shelf nowadays... But in recent years many had been taken off the road. Resale value is not as good as people thought largely because of the huge numbers on the road and also FC was a huge disappointment. Many learnt through the hard way that factory specified FC does not equate to FC in reality. Either the engine is too weak or the car i too heavy. Either way, FC was never good with autogear-equipped sunnies; even with this improved engine. But I do know that current manual equipped sunnies can achieve FC of around 13~14km/L. But don't pin too much hope on Auto sunnies. They had always proven to be "better" drinkers than some of the Korean Cars. My Boss's sunny averages 8~9km/L. How he wished to trade in his Sunny for my City which averages 16km/L....<br><br>5. H.City: Comes in 2 variants. i-DSi or VTEC. FC or performance, choose your ride. VTEC equipped Citys had been claimed by some drivers to achieve 15km/L in the best case. Worst case is subjective as it is dependent on how many times you "kui" the VTEC valves. i-DSi equipped Citys are acclaimed by its maker to be the most Fuel efficient 1.5L saloon car and that record had yet to be beaten. My best personal experience with the FC: 18.2km/L. I'm thinking of ditching my smiles card as I'm having problem clocking enuff points within a specific period...<br><br>And there you have it... the technical specs for the 5 cars that retro listed. Much of what I wrote is what I had experienced with. Owners of respective makes are welcomed to correct my mistakes. Let's learn from here.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Integra,<br><br>I just been to the showroom 2 weeks ago looking for a VTi-S. Well my advise is anyone out there who wants a VTi-S but on a budget u may like to hang on for a while more cos the entire line up of cars from KM may soon be from Thailand as well; minic-ing BM's strategy... But if you die die wan jap standards, perhaps its a good time to go in now. They got some ex stock on hand for you to register to hao-lian the new car to your relatives if you are willing to pen down your signature on that dotted line on the purchase form and on your cheque books...</div>
