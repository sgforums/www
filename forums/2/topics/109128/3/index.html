            <div class='col-md body'>Must agree that vios and city is a good buy. If I have the budget, I will get the city too but now my no 1 choice is Daihatsu YRV 1.3 auto. Its the same engine as vios and made in Japan. Reason I dont want to get a vios is bcoz now the whole singapore is getting it, even malays who hate sedans go for that 2. The chances of a Vios parking next to u in a carpark is damn high. Also, resale defintely affected, since supply is abudance. Juz a penny for my thoughts.</div>

They say, they claim, they boast... whatever... But ultimately it means that these owners did not regret their decision and I think this is a very positive sign that everyone's happy with their own choice and I guess that should be the most important thing. Doesn't matter who's car is faster who's car is not, doesn't matter who's car is cheapskate and who's car is not... Live within your means and be happy. But I guess its alright to have some debate but hoped that everyone who participates in it comes with an open mind to learn, to share and to be objective in giving and listening to other people's views instead of trying to force owners of other makes into submission... Only in this way can this forum maximises its function as a point of view exchange rather than a battleground between owners of different makes...</div>

When I go shopping for a VTi-S 3 weeks ago the SE refused to bulge and insisted that I take back AXA if I wan a new VTi-S... So for your case as  a new owner I think the 1.8k package is quite competitive enuff liao since u get to save $700 upfront... Thats the advantage when you are "sek sek" with the SE... For commoners like us who dun have a choice, most of the time we find outselves "zi-sek" by them.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
