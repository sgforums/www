              <p><span class="rules_subhd"><strong>A successful salesman takes out an auto loan to get the car he always wanted.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Eddie* is a salesman, not married and in his early 30s,
               whose ambition had always been to buy a luxury car. Times were good and
               he was raking in an average of about $6,000 a month including 
              commissions as a paper salesman. So, he took the plunge and ordered a 
              luxury car when he received his commission payout. <br> <br> The day Eddie  picked up his car was the proudest moment
               in his life, even though he had to  take a loan of 90% of his car 
              value, with monthly instalments of $1,600 for a  seven-year period. He 
              felt sure he could cover his monthly payments because at  the time of 
              his purchase, the Singapore economy was bubbling and paper sales  were 
              going very well. <br> <br> But within a year of his purchase, Singapore’s economy  
              had taken a turn for the worse and the paper business started to get 
              bad. His  car had suddenly become an expensive possession that was 
              causing him big  headaches.<br> <br> <span class="bodyred"><a href="http://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/microsite/web_usecreditwisely/rules_10tips.htm"><img src="http://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/microsite/web_usecreditwisely/images/img_tip6.gif" border="0" alt="Don't take on monthly credit payments unless you're certain you can meet them" width="197" height="154" align="right"></a>What should he do?</span><br> <br> <span class="bodylblu11">After the downturn came, Eddie found that he was not earning much more than his basic salary of $3,000 a month. <br> <br> </span><span class="body">After CPF contributions, his 
              take-home pay was about $2,400. As such, monthly payments on his car 
              took up about 67% of his total income, even before factoring in other 
              car-related charges like insurance, road tax and ERP rates. </span><span class="bodylblu11"><br> <br> </span>He had no choice  but to sell his beloved car. <br> <br> However, because he took a car loan of 90%, he  found 
              that he was in negative equity – that is, the amount he had to pay off 
              on  his car loan was more than the amount for which he could sell his 
              car. <br> <br> As a result, he had  to settle the difference with money
               from his savings when he eventually sold  his car. Luckily, Eddie had 
              enough savings to cover the difference. <br> <br> Although he  had lost his beloved car, Eddie’s quick 
              decision to sell off his car helped him  escape even worse debt problems
               as the global financial crisis escalated. If he had waited longer to 
              sell his car, his savings  may not have been enough to cover his loan 
              difference because the selling price  of his car would have fallen 
              further, and he would have also had to continue  paying for the upkeep 
              of the car.<br> <br> <br> <em class="note">* Names are fictitious</em></p>
