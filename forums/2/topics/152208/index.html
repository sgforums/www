            <div class='col-md body'>My situation is such that on average per month, I am currently spending $300 on public transport and a further $200-400 on car rental over the weekends.

The price of a 1 yr old VTI-s is around $62k and the monthly repayment for 90% loan works out to be $660.

It's already more expensive to own a car than take transport... $500-$700 more each month if you own a car... meaning you're paying double each month... It's better to save the money, and take public transport... unless you have enough savings to last even after buying a car... Unless your job really needs you to have a car, I say save your money... My basic rule of thumb is $1k for a normal car, $1k for saving...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bro.. i agree with LH83..<br><br>IMHO, i will only buy a car when i can save minimal $1000 monthly after all my other expenditure..<br><br>den after all that i have $1k-$2.5k.. den i spend on car.. maybe that's $4k a month? or maybe 5k..<br><br>den again.. ur 1200.. round it up to 1500.. give more allowance especially witht he current petrol prices increasing..<br><br>y round up? bcoz after buying the car.. the $$ may not work out to $1200 but maybe near $1500.. den u might be disappointed and feel sad..<br><br>to buy/own a car, its affordable.. to maintain a car.. its expensive..</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I agreed with the rest of the ppl views.<br><br>However, more importantly, what i feel is that you have to ask yourself if you are comfortable to part with tt additional $500-700.<br><br>My rule of thumb is.... if u FORSEE/ANTICIPATE that after owning a car, you no longer feel comfortable financially, dan perhaps its not the right time to own one until u have a deeper pocket.<br><br>Rem..owning a car is CONFIRM a 'waste of money' (its a depreciating metal. It will not appreciate in values).<br>So pls make sure u feel comfotable 'wasting' them($$). Else dont own one.<br><br>Condition is different though if u need a car to make a living (e.g Sales job)</div>
