            <div class='col-md body'>Have u considered long term rental (1 to 3 years) instead of buying a 2nd hand car?<br><br>Although the monthly installment is higher than u buy a new car or 2nd hand, there is no insurance, maintenance to worry about .<br><br>Also u should pay less in the total amount as u will not be in debt for 5 years to 10 years depending on your loan. Why dont u find out about the rental idea and work out the sums?<br><br>The other idea is to rent ur dream car from private car owners. There are several advertisement renting out their own cars (maybe cant afford their installment or just to get extra $ i am not sure). However, it is against the law to rent from private indivduals but the law do allow to rent over the weekend and PH.<br><br>I did came across the hyundai coupe and toyota celica for rent on yahoo.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i look at it this way...<br><br>the car that u buy is "yours" for 10 years only then unless u extend the COE the car has no value onwards. Plus the fuel consumption increase, road tax increase, maintance should be higher also ....<br><br>Furthermore, when u sell ur car, u dun get back ca$h and u need to buy another car with that "ca$h".<br><br>1 more poin, owner sell their car usually after 3rd years, 5th year to prevent losses. So they only "own" car for 3 or 5 years. Sound like renting to me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Renting a car will remove all that problem. The only thing about renting is higher monthly installment but like i said earlier, u will not be in debt for years to come. Of course, this is apply better if u can afford the "upfront" payment for renting.<br><br></div>

May not be as powerful as the 2nd hand one you planned... however it's new and you get to smell a new car interior and it still runs much stronger compared to normal family saloon on road... Better still, the monthly maintenance is definitely lower and you save (every cents counts and it's never too late to start saving) for the 'rainy' day which you can never tells when it will comes... Save more while young. Anyway, getting a Evo/STi/Euro R as a sports family saloon is never 'lou kui' nor too late after you turns 30 or when you plan to start your family...<br><br>Just my thoughts...</div>

I don't mind, but I really want to know how much it'll work out per month for installment alone? Is there still such a thing as a 7yrs (or even 10years) loan? If so, how much for each?<br><br>Or are we suppose to consider the number of years the COE is left with (for 2yrs car, so it'll be 8yrs left, etc...).<br><br>Can give me a rough figure?

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow......saw on the web sgcarmart that a 3 yrs old plus Celica cost 71k! That's pretty expensive still. Hmmmm....... maybe i was wrong, or then maybe, the price can be negotiate further still, esp its already 2 owners. I believe you can get a better price than that, esp if those having parf 65% of OMV. Maybe a 2 yr old Celica will be cheaper cos of lower Parf.<br><br>Nevertheless, Rumie, I believe with your budget, you can only go for a SS1 instead of SS2. But then, how much are you downpaying? 0% is quite impossible. Maybe lets take it as 10k downpayment, excluding insurance and rd tax etc.<br><br>To work out your sum, lets say a 3 yrs old Celica SS1 cost 70k (est. from the car in the web), so after 10k downpayment, you loan abt 60k for 7 yrs. So your interest will be S$1620 a yr (based on 2.7% for 2nd hand car), and a total of S$11340. Your total loan is 11340+60000 = 71340 ........ yrly will be 71340/7 = S$10191, and a mnthly of 10191/12 = S$850/- .<br><br>So thats roughly what you pay per mnth for installment only. Of cause, after 7 yrs, when you scrap your car, you will get back abt 20k. So your depreciation per yr is abt S$7.1-7.2k.<br><br>But I have to remind you that your insurance will be very very expensive. Hope my calculation helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for the help people, it IS an eye opener for me.<br><br>I do hope of being the 2nd owner (and not anything more than that).<br><br>The car that I'm driving, I'm the first owner and it's costing me about $900/month for me.<br>SO, having the pay abt the same amount for a second hand car, is something that I've to convince myself first.<br><br>I'll be going through thoroughly the difference between the SS1 and SS2 and see what sort of difference they have before I buy anything.<br><br>But after driving for about 2 years now, and seeing all these road blocks, speed camera and mobile speed camera on the roads, think I won't be getting a car that has better torque or power. Haha...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Maybe I'll be considering more of the driveability and safety, IF there're any differences.<br>But then, the looks of the car is still the main thing, and I hope there's not much difference in the looks between the SS1 and SS2.<br><br>I'll be prepared for at least a 10% down excluding the insurance and road tax, etc..<br><br>And as for the insurance, think I'll be using my dad-in-law's 30yr old license.

Yup, its the NEW Hyundai coupe.... ermmm ..... dunnoe why but old one no one call them Tuscani.<br><br>I don't mind having one if the price is rite cos it look really good.<br><br>The negative aspect, though is that the car is underpower (2000cc, and 145bhp) *** pls correct me if wrong cos saw the figure somewhere sometime back, might remember correctly*** and it comes in auto only (If buy from Komoco, not too sure abt PI). Normally for coupe, guess the fun lies in driving a manual. The 2700cc version is better with 190bhp, but the road tax will kill you.<br><br>Head to head compare.<br>Celica SS1, Auto/5 speed Manual (1800cc, so cheaper road tax) = 145bhp<br>Tuscani, Auto (2000cc) = 145bhp  &lt;&lt; Believe there's 5 speed manual from PI)<br>Celica SS2, Auto/6 speed Manual (1800cc also) = 190bhp<br>Tuscani, Auto/6 speed Manual (2700cc, expensive rd tax!) = 190bhp<br></div>
