              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Drink driving stats are falling to encouraging levels, but hiccups remain. By </span><span style="color: #333333;">Ramesh William</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><img src="http://is-magazine.com/sites/default/files/image/459/6-8-Feature1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Last month’s crackdown on illegal racing along Orchard Road raised a set of 
              worrying questions. Why didn’t the Traffic Police, who were aware of the 
              high-speed racers in the area, take action sooner? Or, what if one of the 
              drivers were under the influence of alcohol, lost control of his car and crashed 
              into an innocent group of bystanders? As it turned out, none of the drivers, 
              thankfully, were found with illegal amounts of alcohol in their blood. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><br>         Because when it comes to drink driving, the Traffic Police takes no chances. 
              Through aggressive educational and promotional incentives and some of the 
              stiffest penalties anywhere in the world, the government body, alongside alcohol 
              companies and entertainment venues, are slowly but surely wrestling the drink 
              driving demon to the ground. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><br>        The statistics coming out of the Ministry of 
              Home Affairs are encouraging. Compared to previous years, the number of drink 
              driving arrests fell markedly in 2008—dropping from a 10-year high in 2007 
              (4,010) to 3,586, while the number of drink driving accidents fell from 188 in 
              2007 to 179 last year. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        The positive trend has continued this year with 
              2009’s first quarter registering 688 arrests when compared to 2008 (851) and 
              2007 (915). But within the optimistic-looking figures, lies a more macabre 
              number. The number of deaths rose last year—22 compared to 2007’s 15. Remember 
              Mark Twain’s quip about lies, damned lies and statistics, well it seems you can 
              almost file the above stats in that drawer. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        The Traffic Police, however, 
              is not letting its guard slip. “While we’ve made relentless efforts in our fight 
              against drink driving, we are very concerned that there were more drink driving 
              deaths on our roads last year when compared to the previous year,” says 
              Inspector Ivan Choo of the Police Public Affairs Department. “We will continue 
              to collaborate with the various entertainment outlets to drive home the 
              anti-drink drive message ... and also our effective ring-fencing strategy and 
              our numerous educational initiatives.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Ring-fencing is the strategy of 
              road-blocking all routes out of major drinking and entertainment areas, and has 
              been credited with driving down the number of drink driving cases.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        What 
              does this mean then? Do we take heart from fewer arrests or raise a concerned 
              eyebrow in the direction of more deaths on the road? Are our responsible 
              drinking campaigns actually working?</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Three Way Partnership </span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>         The authorities are also 
              working with alcohol distributors and entertainment venues to hammer home the 
              point that drinking and driving don’t mix and, in fact, are absolute taboo. 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Marquee entertainment venues like Zouk are among those who collaborate 
              with the Police to educate the public on the perils of getting behind the wheel 
              stupefied. “We work very closely with the Traffic Police in promoting anti-drink 
              drive campaigns,” says Zouk’s Marketing Manager Mari Muramoto. “Posters 
              conveying such messages are put up within the club premises especially in the 
              toilets to create greater awareness and to serve as a further reminder to 
              patrons.” The club also has one wall mounted breathalyzer for patrons to check 
              whether they’re in any fit condition to drive home, and three handheld 
              breathalyzers that are administered by the valets to check on driving patrons. 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Even smaller nightspots like Balaclava in Suntec City and Wala Wala in 
              Holland Village work with the authorities to put up anti drink drive posters 
              throughout their premises.  The most prominent Traffic Police-fronted anti-drink 
              drive campaign in recent times has been the “shock tactic” method of using gory 
              images of accidents with “drink familiar” taglines like “Bloody Mary,” “One for 
              the Road” and “On the Rocks.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        “We’ve got Traffic Police posters 
              prominently displayed in both our bars,” says Carol-Anne Wah of Wala Wala and 
              Balaclava. “But the most effective enforcers of the responsible drinking 
              campaigns are our staff—they’ll look after you and even stop serving you if they 
              feel you’ve had one too many drinks.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Wah also says that it has partnered 
              with Diageo, the holding company of its whiskey house pour Johnnie Walker, to 
              give away taxi vouchers to patrons who buy bottles of the premium Scotch. The 
              company behind well-known alcohol brands like Guinness, Smirnoff and Jose 
              Cuervo, Diageo is at the forefront of the battle against anti-drink drive 
              message and trumpets responsible drinking at every given opportunity. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">         Through its “Guardian Angel” and “Join the Pact” campaigns, Diageo collaborates 
              with entertainment venues and the authorities to ensure no stone goes unturned 
              in this tripartite fight against drink driving. “We have a long track record of 
              supporting anti-drink driving initiatives in many countries,” says Lin Menuhin, 
              alcohol and responsibility director for Diageo Asia Pacific. “The ‘Guardian 
              Angel’ campaign is one of many similar responsible drinking initiatives we have 
              developed to educate consumers about drinking responsibly and abstaining from 
              getting behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Meanwhile, Asia 
              Pacific Breweries (APB), which has alcohol brands like Tiger Beer and Heineken, 
              has been equally at the fore of the campaign against drink driving, rolling out 
              a slew of responsible drinking initiatives over the years. “As a responsible 
              corporate citizen and the leading brewer in Singapore, we see our involvement in 
              these campaigns and programs as an essential component of the company’s 
              corporate social responsibility efforts,” says Frazer Neo-Macken, APB’s 
              spokesperson. “We seek to educate the public about drinking responsibly as well 
              as promote a positive drinking experience for all.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        In 2007, Tiger 
              introduced the “Know Your Limit” initiative, where breathalyzers were provided 
              at venues St. James Power Station and Zouk. In 2008, it introduced, with the 
              support of Traffic Police, the Tiger “Don’t Drink and Drive. It’s EZ” initiative 
              where drivers can redeem complimentary EZ-Link cards so that they can take 
              public transport home. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        “By introducing such initiatives, we believe that 
              we provide drivers with a choice and an alternative to go home safely after a 
              night out, and a reminder that one should never drink and drive as there are 
              available alternatives,” adds Neo-Macken. <br>  <br></span><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Going it 
              Alone</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>Some clubs like Zirca at Clarke Quay choose to go it alone 
              when promoting the anti-drink drive message. “Zirca has not started promoting 
              anti-drink driving messages on our premises, but we are definitely glad to do so 
              if a suitable partner comes along and works with us on the campaign,” says 
              Zirca’s marketing spokesperson Lim Yi Fang. “On the ground, our operations 
              managers, floor staff and front office managers will often advise our guests 
              [who appear seemingly drunk] to go for the valet services just outside Zirca, 
              which is run by CapitaLand [which runs Clarke Quay], or call a cab back for the 
              guests who do not drive.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        The club is also proactive when it suspects that 
              a driving patron may have had one too many drinks. “Based on our operations 
              team’s experience, they are usually able to spot customers who have had too many 
              drinks to drive,” says Lim. “However, for those who can hold their drinks but 
              exceed the legal alcohol limit, the best way to monitor will be through a 
              breathalyzer.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        But sometimes monitoring alone is not effective in crowded 
              establishments. “Come work at our bars; we can’t monitor everything,” says 
              Balaclava and Wala Wala’s Carol-Anne Wah. “But it’s very easy to monitor regular 
              guests once you get a hang of who drives and who doesn’t. If we see someone 
              really tipsy, we take their car keys away. Seriously, we’ve done it before to 
              regulars...or we call their friends.” </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Areas of Concern</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>But having posters and enforcers are not 
              enough, as the onus is on patrons to be responsible for their own actions. A 
              restaurateur, who requested that his name be withheld, said that it is not 
              uncommon for customers at both his establishments to order a couple of bottles 
              of wine with their meal and drive off after that. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        “Most people think that 
              only those who are at nightspots are prone to drink driving,” he says. “I have 
              seen people who, after a consuming half a bottle of wine, stagger up from their 
              seats after a meal. Not a single one has ever accepted my offer—this has been 
              the case for a few years now—of calling them a cab; some even get hyper 
              aggressive when I ask them if they’re any fit condition to drive.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        It’s 
              precisely because of episodes like these that he feels that the effectiveness of 
              the Traffic Police’s ring-fencing policy may be limited. “Both my restaurants 
              are outside the entertainment areas; one’s in the east, the other in the north,” 
              he says. “My customers know that a couple of glasses of wine can take them over 
              the legal limit but they also know that they’re unlikely to encounter any 
              roadblocks, especially if they don’t live far away.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Others too point out 
              that the anti-drink driving measures and campaigns must be sustained outside the 
              festive periods and include areas outside of the city’s main entertainment hubs. 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        A regular pubgoer and father of three, Sebastian Wee, says that he feels 
              with the economy in poor shape, more may be drinking elsewhere outside the main 
              entertainment belts and urges the authorities to take note of possible worrying 
              trends. “We’ve already seen reports stating that many are staying away from bars 
              and nightclubs, as people don’t want to spend too much money in this economic 
              recession,” says Wee. “I know many who are drinking at cheaper places like at 
              coffee shops or at friends’ homes. Right now the campaigns and the Traffic 
              Police seem too focused on places like Zouk, Clarke Quay or the Dempsey area, 
              when the reality is there are just as many people drinking at coffee shops in 
              Woodlands and driving home to Ang Mo Kio. They are equally a threat too, and 
              must be targeted in Traffic Police’s drink driving outreach programs.” </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Targeted Campaigns </span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>Wee, who has two children in their 
              ‘20s and a teenager, also feels that anti-drink drive campaigns should 
              aggressively target youths, more so than they are now. “What’s the first thing 
              youngsters do when they get their license?” asks Wee. “They go out and party! 
              And you think he or she is going to stand around and be the teetotal designated 
              driver on that night? Fat chance. Also remember that these kids, unlike adults, 
              have a lower tolerance to alcohol and spirits.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        It is precisely because of 
              this worrying trend that companies like Diageo and APB have rolled out 
              youth-centric campaigns. APB’s Neo-Macken says that the company launched Get 
              Your Sexy Back (GYSB), a youth-led moderate drinking campaign aimed at promoting 
              responsible drinking among young adults by raising the social currency of 
              moderation. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        “The initial campaign launch in December 2007 was very well 
              received,” he says. “And we have since October 2008 expanded GYSB into a 
              full-fledged program driven by enthusiastic youth volunteers, and reaching out 
              to young people through events and activities that are relevant to them.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">         Meanwhile, Diageo has partnered with Manchester United and drivers from Formula 
              One racing outfit McClaren Mercedes, like current and former world champions 
              Lewis Hamilton and Mika Hakkinen respectively, in an obvious effort to target 
              testosterone-fuelled party-going male drivers. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        “The Johnnie Walker ‘JOIN 
              THE PACT Never Drink and Drive’ campaign is one of our most high-profile 
              responsible drinking campaigns to date,” says Diageo’s Menuhin.  “The campaign 
              asks consumers to make a personal pledge to never drink and drive and the 
              response has been overwhelming, so we know that consumers are really taking the 
              message to heart.”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">         Menuhin also adds that in order for his company’s 
              responsible drinking campaigns to work, they must be trendy and innovative to 
              appeal to their target audience.  “We try to make sure the responsible drinking 
              message is delivered in a way that a more dynamic consumer group can relate to 
              it,” says Menuhin. “We also try to stress that we’re not discouraging people 
              from drinking or having fun, we just want consumers to stay safe and make smart 
              decisions.” <br></span><strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>Old Habits Die Hard</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>Despite the 
              campaigns and initiatives, there are those who still persist in driving home; if 
              only because most drive to nightspots in the first place. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        “Actually, most 
              don’t mind taking a cab home,” says Ben (not his real name). “It’s just getting 
              to these places on Friday and Saturday nights can be so troublesome. It’s always 
              a bitch to get cabs after seven, eight o’clock on these nights; the surcharges 
              are ridiculous and drivers get grumpy when you ask them to make a stop to pick 
              up your friends. So who wouldn’t want to just drive there themselves when they 
              have a car?”<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Ben says he stops at three beers when he drives to these 
              places, and makes sure he paces his drinks, so that he doesn’t get “slammed” by 
              the effects of alcohol—even though he may well be over the drink driving limit. 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Another regular pubgoer, Alan Tan, says that while he never drives to such 
              places, he can understand why people would feel uncomfortable leaving their cars 
              there. “Some aren’t really aware of the establishments’ policies,” says Tan. 
              “They feel that if they leave their cars there overnight, they would incur a 
              huge bill, or worse, get their cars towed away.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Zouk’s Mari Muramoto says 
              the club goes out of its way to ensure that patrons who drive need not be too 
              concerned about driving home. “Our security and valets are all instructed to 
              call for taxis for the patrons and to allow drivers who have had too much to 
              drink to leave their cars parked overnight at no charge,” she says. “Valet 
              services are also provided free of charge to drive patrons home when they are 
              unable to do so, and a nominal charge for transport is usually recommended for 
              the valet to return to Zouk.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Joyce Wee, the daughter of Sebastian Wee, 
              says that it still baffles her as to how people continue with such irresponsible 
              behavior. “I’m absolutely dumbfounded when I see people who can afford cars, but 
              don’t want to spend less than 20 dollars to take a cab home,” she says. “If they 
              don’t value their lives, it’s their problem, but if they show no consideration 
              to those around them and endanger innocent lives, they should be locked up for a 
              very long time—and be banned from driving for life.”</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Tougher Penalties</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>The Traffic Police has upped its 
              penalties in recent years and will continue to be heavy-handed with motorists 
              who flout the law. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        “We would like to once again remind the public that 
              drink driving is a very serious offence and the penalties are severe,” says 
              Inspector Ivan Choo of the Police Public Affairs Department. “Even if the 
              driver’s alcohol content in his blood or breath does not go beyond the legal 
              limit, he can still be charged for drink driving if he is unable to control his 
              vehicle properly.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        Drink drivers, on conviction, will be disqualified from 
              driving for at least 12 months, which would, in effect, invalidate their driving 
              licenses. In addition, first-time offenders can be fined between $1,000 and 
              $5,000, or jailed up to six months, while repeat offenders may be punished with 
              a maximum fine of $30,000 and a mandatory jail term of up to three years.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">         Wala Wala’s Carol-Anne Wah says that severe punitive measures in this economic 
              climate are making Singaporeans really think twice about driving under 
              influence. “I think Singaporeans just don’t want to lose their license,” she 
              says. “With the police force enforcing things around town, you really wouldn’t 
              want to mess with them.” <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        So, to some extent, the mixture of “shock tactic” 
              advertising, the heavy fines, better policing and proactive measures by the 
              nightlife industry as a whole have led to this present downturn in drink driving 
              cases. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        “I think a lot of credit is also due to the fantastic partners we 
              work with, including the traffic police and responsible outlet owners,” says 
              Diageo’s Menuhin. “Awareness of the importance of responsible drinking has 
              increased dramatically over the past few years and a lot of stakeholders have 
              really stepped up their commitment to ensuring alcohol is enjoyed responsibly.” 
              <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">         So while the stats tell an encouraging story about the drink driving in 
              Singapore, the message of responsible drinking must be sustained throughout the 
              year, through different mediums and at locations islandwide. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">         This view is 
              echoed by APB’s Neo-Macken. He says, “The anti-drink driving message must be a 
              continuous effort and we’re confident that together with our partners, we keep 
              increasing the levels of awareness among drivers about the dangers of drink 
              driving every year.” <br>  <br></span><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Know the Law</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>A person can be 
              convicted of drink driving under the Road Traffic Act in the following two 
              instances:<br>1) If a driver is found with more than 35 micrograms of alcohol 
              per 100 ml of breath, or more than 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, 
              he has broken the law, whether or not he has perfect control of the vehicle when 
              caught.<br>2) If the driver’s alcohol level is under the legal limit, the driver 
              can still be convicted if it is shown that he did not have proper control of the 
              vehicle as a result of alcoholic intoxication.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">        As a guide, about four units 
              of alcohol for men and three units for women per hour is all that is required 
              before one is legally unfit to drive. Compare these units to a single measure of 
              spirits (one unit), strong lager (three units), standard lager (two units) and a 
              small glass of wine (average 1.5 units) and you will realize just how little you 
              need to drink before being over the limit.<br>  <br></span><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Talk to an 
              Angel</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>Diageo launched the Diageo Guardian Angel program in 2007, 
              where winged ambassadors spread the anti-drink driving message at high profile 
              nightspots during the festive season. We talk one of the Angels—model Amanda 
              Swa. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">What is your main role as a Diageo Angel?</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>As an angel, I 
              champion the responsible drinking message. Our role as Angels is to communicate 
              that in a fresh and dynamic way. The message to consumers is that drinking and 
              driving is selfish and irresponsible. We take our message to the streets and 
              nightspots and talk to consumers face-to-face. We don’t want to stop people from 
              going out and having a good time, but we do want them to be responsible. 
              Ultimately, we want them to think about the dangers of drink driving and to take 
              on the message: If you drink, don’t drive.  </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">What are some of the more interesting reactions you get from patrons 
              when you approach them with the responsible drinking message? </span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>Most 
              people smile when they see us approaching them and for the most part they are 
              genuinely willing to listen. Some are more interested in taking photos with us, 
              quite a few ask to try on our wings and some have even offered to buy us drinks. 
              But I would say the best reaction is when people really take the message to 
              heart. When we first launched the campaign, on our very first night out, we had 
              a guy hand his car keys to his friend and promised to take a taxi home. That was 
              an amazing moment that really made me believe we could make a real difference 
              with this campaign.<br>  <br></span><strong><span style="color: #333333;">How do you handle patrons who are clearly 
              inebriated? </span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>We’ve always been polite and friendly. We’re not out to 
              lecture people, we just want to remind them to stay safe.<br> <br></span><strong><span style="color: #333333;">What 
              would you like to tell people who still insist on drinking and 
              driving?</span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"><br>I would tell them there is simply no excuse for drink 
              driving. If you drink and drive, not only are you putting yourself in danger, 
              you are also endangering everyone else on the road. No matter how expensive the 
              taxi ride home, it will never cost you as much as drink driving.</span></p>
