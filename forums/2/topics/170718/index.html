            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to take this oppotunity to urge everyone to drive or ride safely...today i juz saw 2 accidents at 2 different locations and it was pretty serious...the 1st one involves a collision between a van and a motorbike and from what i saw...the bike basically broke into 2 and the rider has been evacuated..while driving past i can still see blood stain on the road...its very disturbing...while the 2nd one involves a van that crushes into the barrier along CTE....while driving past i can see the paramedics are all urgently attending to the motionless body on the road...i guess i dun need to tell u about the more gruesome part i witness...Please think twice before u do anything stupid on the road and be really careful specially driving past those bikers..no matter what the person does on the road or how impatient u are...think twice before u doanything because these people do have family waiting for them to get home..JUST like URSELF!! Dun be a selfish bugger!<br><br>I once spoken to someone and he mentioned that he doesn;t care abt the safety of riders while driving and will always tailgate them when they are blocking his way...the reason given was that bikers with their small size should always give way to larger vehicles and if they got into accident or what so ever...thats their business and he wouldn't feel guilty abt it...<br><br>What im trying to say is that there are these kind of mad men whom are driving on the road...so all road users please ride or drive safely...this is especially so to all those new drivers that are driving those fancyful sport cars...i notice alot nowadays tend to zoom in and out of lanes as well as tailgating vehicles trying to show how good their driving skills is....everytime i got the shock of my life by seeing that...they simply spare no regards for others</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>talking abt taxi drivers...i was involved in an accident while i was still studying...was riding a bike then....this Ass#$%$ speeded up behind me when i was cutting in his lane in order to do a turning into car park...prior to that i was very sure that before cutting in..i was at least 3 to 4 car lenghts away...however, the driver thought that by moving in close i would move away..the front of his car touches the back of my wheel, as a result it causes my bike to skid. i rolled over to the 2nd lane...luckily the car behind moving on 2nd lane manage to e-brake on time..if not i wouldn;t be here anymore. And guess what did the taxi driver do...he turn to the other side to avoid hitting my bike on the side to the road and speeded off immediately...it all happened so fast that i could not even take down his car plate number. Suffer some injuries in the end which requires a few stiches on my elbow</div>

However, this isn't my point, I like to point out that smoking inside your vehicle screws up your aircon over time. When I stopped smoking inside my car or while I'm driving, I notice my aircon don't need much maintainence anymore, and it's still cold after 2 years.<br><br>It seems that particles from ciggarette smoke  adheres to the filter or coil unit inside car and over time develops fungus which impedes aircon performance. The smoke tend to make the surface of the filter and coils sticky and collect more dust that sticks.<br><br>Besides, smoking in your vehicle creates a sour and stale odour in your vehicle which will never go away.</div>
