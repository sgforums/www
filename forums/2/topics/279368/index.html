Mr Hairudien was sleeping when his father woke him up around 4am and told him to rush down to the open-air carpark in their block.<br><br>By the time Mr Hairudien reached there, firemen had put out the fire that had engulfed the front half of the silver 2 1/2-year-old Kia Cerato.<br><br>The freelance graphics designer later found out from the SCDF report that the fire was probably due to to an electrical short circuit.<br><br>MECHANICAL PROBLEMS<br><br>He told The New Paper that the car had been sent for repairs about two months before the fire, because of mechanical problems.<br><br>He said: 'A few times, when I stopped at a traffic light or junction, the car would stall. The light indicating that there was something wrong with the engine also came on.<br><br>'So I sent the car to the Kia workshop, and the technician told me that they had to monitor the car for a week.'<br><br>When he collected his car a week later, he was informed that the car's purge valve, which controls the flow of fuel, had been replaced for free, as the car was still under warranty.<br><br>Mr Hairudien bought the car for more than $60,000. The 10-year loan, including interest, came up to more than $70,000. He said he couldn't recall the exact loan amount.<br><br>Now the car has been officially valued at $32,000. The valuation depends on the car make and model, and how old it is.<br><br>A salvage buyer has offered to pay this amount, excluding a $500 insurance excess which Mr Hairudien has to pay.<br><br>His insurance company, AIG, will pay another $1,400 towards settling the balance of Mr Hairudien's car loan with Maybank.<br><br>When The New Paper contacted AIG last Friday to ask why the insurance amount was so low, they said they are investigating the matter.<br><br>But as of yesterday, Mr Hairudien claimed the company hasn't contacted him.<br><br>Despite the offer from the salvage buyer and the payout from the insurance company, Mr Hairudien claims he must fork out $13,500 to settle the loan amount by tomorrow or Maybank will start to charge him interest.<br><br>He said he has been paying $588 a month for the last 2 1/2 years as part of his repayment plan.<br><br>He had also traded in his earlier car to offset the new car's cost.<br><br>Mr Hairudien approached Kia twice - on the day his car was burnt and then on 21 Aug. They offered him a new car at a discount.<br><br>Kia offered to pay the $13,500 upfront, and then add the sum to the total cost of his new car, to be paid back in instalments.<br><br>When contacted, Cycle &amp; Carriage, which distributes Kia, declined to comment on the loan repayment offer but said it would act in accordance with AIG's conclusions.<br><br>Customer assistance centre manager Dora Yan said: 'Mr Hairudien's accident case is currently being handled by his insurance company, AIG. They are looking into his case and Cycle &amp; Carriage will assist AIG in this matter.<br><br>'As for the sum of money that he has to pay to his finance company, Maybank, we are not in a position to comment as it is the bank's decision.<br><br>'Our company offered Mr Hairudien a goodwill discount on his new car package, should he wish to purchase a new car from our company.<br><br>'This is done purely to show our appreciation to Mr Hairudien for being a loyal customer.'</div>
