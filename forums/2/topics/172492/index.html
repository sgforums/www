So if you bring your focus to US, it still must be pumped 92 at least.<br><br>Car engines can be timed up or timed down to receive different kind of fuels.<br><br>Actually in North America, you can only find RON 87, 89, 91. Some station will have 94.<br><br>As for using RON 95 or 98 or V-power. You can just use the fuel your engine is designed for.<br><br>98 and V-power are both RON 98 fuel but V-power have additives to it that you can add performance to the car. But The cost benefits is not there lah.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if you ppl say no difference between 92, 95, 98 or v power.... then why do they come up with these in the first place? besides, different ppl are driving different cars choosing different stations to fill up... but come to think of it, using a high grade fuel once in a while does has it's benefits, logically speaking. same principal as changing your engine oil during servicing... after the oil change you feel that your car can rev better.... change transmission fluid you'll find you can shift easier and changing brake fluid, better braking yadiyadiya....<br><br></div>

Otherwise V-power is just a RON 98 fuel with additive.<br><br>Why there are different grades available is not for consumer choice but rather the wide range of cars we have here.<br><br>A turbocharged vehicle and higher-end cars will need a higher ron (RON 9<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> because their engines are designed to combust fuel at a given interval. If the fuel combust lesser than expected to, it will not deliver the 'expansion of the gases" required and thus detrimental to your engine.<br><br>As for you saying if your vehicle feels better after an oil change or any other fluid change. This is simply because you are using a new fluid.<br><br>Fluids in your vehicle will collect grime and become more viscous over time. This gives the explanation why you feel your vehicle is smoother after a service.<br><br></div>
