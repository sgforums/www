            <div class='col-md body'>Yes and NO depending who you buy from.<br><br>Assuming your are eligible to own a car , ...<br><br>PIs' price requires you to take at least 7 to 10 yrs loan. Else you pay a penalty, usually in excess of 1k.<br><br>For the regular dealers, then its a .... YES (exclude insurance). Assuming the price incudes the usual coe, reg fee, car plate, 6mth road tax, etc. For those that includes finance rebate n inhouse insurance rebate, you'll have to take those out. Insurance cost will depend on individual.<br><br>But as sweetie05 mentioned, you save a bit if you take min loan min period cos when you take loan, they will give you the finance rebate, which will usually be more than your interest payable for min loan min period. ..... But then again, if you can fork out 70k cash for a car, whats a couple of hundred more ??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To get the rebates or "discount" from loans, you will need to get at least a 30% loan for 3 yrs to get the benifits. But if you take into account on the interest rates for the next 3 years, It would not be advisable. If you calculate to the max taking loan for 3 yrs minus away the discounts they are giving, You would still be paying more. Cash would be the best deal. Especially to the car dealers. If you can give them hard cash in full, you can negotiate for better deals or slight discount. But normally they would throw in some freebies. It would be more advisable to go to a SE or agent whom you know or got friends knows. Just like that time go and buy car, he waive 1k for immediate COE no need to wait for bid + discount 500 cash + some discount vouchers. Normally for secured immediate COE they would charge 1K more. Thats what CC is doing. You got to play hard with the SE and negotiate for better deals whether you can get it or not depends on your luck, skill and whether the agent give in to you or not. If they tell you " cannot leh.. company policy.. fixed price...." You tell them you go find other agent liao... its bullshit..<br><br>Although cheques can be cleared within 3 working days, you still got to wait at least 5-14 days for them to do the process of registering of vehicles+insurance etc etc. And depending on the availability of the stock.<br><br>If you can out-talk the agent, you already won half the battle, the rest depends on your luck on whether you will get the deal or not. The discounts is depending whether the SE wans to reduce his commision or not. Some agents dun take commission but hit quotas.. you will be in luck if you manage to find 1. But then, its very rare.</div>
