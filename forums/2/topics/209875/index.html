            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, now that you're in here and reading, let me explain that my definition of Door Dimple is the kind of dents, you normally get from neighboring parked vehicle opening their door too hard and wide, that it hits your car broadside.<br><br>I have a friend who lives in my HDB block. He is a regular business owner doing small time trading goods and services, half Ah Beng half English educated. He drives a very well kept Toyota Hiace van which he polishes every week.<br><br>One day, he went to a nearby marketplace to have a meal (dinner or lunch I can't remember now). When he got there, he found a vacant lot and reversed into it. Shortly after he parked and turned off his engine, another car (a new Kia - something I can't remember also) reversed into the lot next to him. Before he could get out of his van, the driver of the Kia (a middle aged guy with his assumably, wife) swung open his door very hard and banged against the left side of his van. In shock, he got out quickly to go take a look at his left side panel; not surprisingly, he sees a very deep indentation caused by the other party's car door. He looked at the dent and then turn around to look at the driver. The guy and his wife just walks away towards the market like nothing happened at all!<br><br>My friend stood there watching him walk away, contemplated chasing him down and giving him a few nice knuckle burgers, but thought better not to get involved in a Police case. So he walks around this middle aged guy's car and noted that for a car that has a plate starting with SFX (very new) it sure has a lot of dents and scratches (the kind of scratches you normally get from keys) and its rear end has already been collided into.<br><br>So since he noted the other side of the guy's car was already scratched from back to front, he contributed another long back to front scratch with his van's keys. He said out loud after scratching; "An eye for an eye.." and drove off somewhere else.<br><br>Personally, what makes a person so brazen as to swing his door so hard and wide that it damages neighboring vehicles? And why is he treating his new car so carelessly? What more, he was aware that my friend was still in the van and yet swung his door. ANd my friend looks like am Ah Long bill collector! The old man isn't afraid of getting beaten to a pulp??<br><br>After I was told this incident, I couldn't stop wondering why is this person so "fearless"?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about this topic makes my blood boil man.... just imagine spending soooo much money on a brand new car... then few days to a week later, you realise a few little dents here and there... wa lao, it really hurts lor.... i dunno why other people cannot open their doors gently... i always make an effort to make sure tht my door doesnt hit the car next to me lor.... wat is wrong with these inconsiderate people man?! Haiz... so disappointed in them....<br><br>Anyone knows if it's possible to get rid of these dents? Let's say after 3 years of using your car, u decide to give it a new look.... does it mean i have to bring it to the mechanic and let him fill up the dents and then send the whole car for a new coat of paint?</div>
