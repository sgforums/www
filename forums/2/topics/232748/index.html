In case you don't really know... the pride of owning a car itself here and not getting it reposessed is already a good thing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If they want power, then get the Focus ST lah... It's the same for people who find that the Impreza is too underpowered... they can always get the WRX... Totally different class wat...<br><br>As for the FC figures, it's give and take... you already mentioned quite a few attractive points about the car.. plus the free 3 or 5 years servicing and warranty, you dont really lose much as comapred to getting a Jap car... In fact, you will feel that it's a better buy...<br><br>I'm am talking about those who has enough savings to have choices in the first place...

If they want power, then get the Focus ST lah... It's the same for people who find that the Impreza is too underpowered... they can always get the WRX... Totally different class wat...<br><br>As for the FC figures, it's give and take... you already mentioned quite a few attractive points about the car.. plus the free 3 or 5 years servicing and warranty, you dont really lose much as comapred to getting a Jap car... In fact, you will feel that it's a better buy...<br><br>I'm am talking about those who has enough savings to have choices in the first place... If we are talking about those who have to eat grass everyday after getting an Altis, then i got nothing to say... </div></blockquote>i nv said that focus was underpowered.. what i meant was undecerning customers might take a look at the brochure and "THINK" that its underpowered...<br><br>they will say.. hey the altis have better FC and more power.... more "hua"<br><br>and these group of pple will not get the ST/wrx cos they treat their cars as point a to point b machines...they are not likely to be knowlegable or passionate about cars.... and is not willing to spend...<br><br>and since cars are expensive in sg.. its too risky to take the plunge into the unknown.. therefore it makes perfect sense for them to follow the crowd... which i think is not a bad thing...<br><br>in a way non-luxury continental car segments in sg have veh little market share... made worse by lack of advertisements and the traditional saying that continentals drink and have high maintenance.....</div>
