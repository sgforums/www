            <div class='col-md body'>I'm pretty sure that the saf drivers are able to match or even surpass the civilian drivers as the amount of driving they go through during the course period is definitely longer than that of the latter. Moreover, they undergo an islandwide familiarisation drive after they pass their driving test. As far as i know, civilian drivers do not have to undergo all these. The testers are definitely not lenient in their grading, on the other hand, i feel that their counterparts are much more lenient. The 11point demerit point system is also makes it harder to pass the test. I thus do not understand why saf drivers are not allowed to drive civilian vehicles.</div>

Anyhow, I think that civilian testers are quite a lot stricter than military ones. The 11 point demerit point system only does so much to attempt to level this discrepancy. Clock... 7k km (is it?) and you're allowed to convert to a civilian license anyway. =)<br><br>I speak as one with both military and civilian license.</div>
