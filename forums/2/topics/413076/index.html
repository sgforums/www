              <p>I have heard there is a new company in Singapore which allows people with a valid driving license to drive a Formula Race Car at the Sepang F1 Circuit.</p>
              <p>Have seen the Formula BMW race during the F1 event in Singapore and would love to drive such a car by myself.</p>

              <p>I have seen this a couple of years ago in Europe with 2 different concepts.</p>
              <p>1.)Arrive and Drive</p>
              <p>Is basically the same as you go today to a Go-Kart rental place.You book a 10 or 15 minutes drive and go out.If you have no experience,you take out 20% of what you have paid for.No instructions,equipment not always well maintained and you never know what other crazy guys are out on track,thinking these cars are more bumper cars than race cars.</p>
              <p>2.) Event</p>
              <p>You have usually several sessions and a lot of guidance. Typically you are in a group with several cars out on track at the same time.Much more fun and absolutely safe.The whole event is more like a race day on track and well organized with up-to-date equipment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With Sepang track usually very busy,I would think it's more an event type.</p>

              <p>I can't imagine this is a Formula 1 car.If you are not a very experienced race car driver there is no way you can handle such a beast.</p>
              <p>From what I have understood it's an activity for people without any race experience and therefore it's more likely to be an entry level racing car,like Formula BMW or F3.</p>
              <p>And if it's the event type of activity,my concern of safety is addessed.</p>
              <p>But what about race suits and helmets,etc.Does anybody know if this equipment will be provided or I need to buy this by myself before being able to participate in such an event ?</p>

              <p>Good question.</p>
              <p>Buying this type of equipment by yourself will set you back easily by 2.000 Dollars.</p>
              <p>But if this new company is really professional,they will provide.Just look out if the race suits or helmets are hand-downs from other race drivers and have been used hundred times before you get them.</p>
              <p>But back to my original question : Did anybody hear of this new company and how they can be contacted ?</p>
              <p>One rumor is saying they have a first opportunity end of this year,race seats are very limited and I would hate to loose this opportunity.</p>

              <p>I have heard from my friend about this company.Apparently they have a first event on 28th December at the Sepang Formula 1 Track.</p>
              <p>Closing date for booking a drive is mid November.The cars are Formula Renault Cars raced around the world in several race series.</p>
              <p>No idea about the price,but I want to book a place.</p>
              <p>Where can I find them ?</p>

              <p>Have done the "arrive and drive" a few years ago in Europe.The car was an old Formula Ford car,which is basically more driving a Go-Kart than a Formula Race Car.Have done 2 sessions and each session has cost me around 500 Dollars.Was interesting,but I have been struggling with how to control the car and find the right race line on track.</p>
              <p>If these guys really let you drive in a Formula Renault Car and make this as an event with 4..5 sessions and a lot of guidance from a race car driver,there is no magic and most likely each session is worth 1.000 Dollars.Means,this will set you back most likely around 4.000 Dollars to 5.000 Dollars.</p>
              <p>I think such a unique and thrilling experience is worth it.</p>

              <p>Speedjunkie,not everybody is a lucky as you and can drive a Porsche.</p>
              <p>And also,to drive such a car you had to buy it first.</p>
              <p>Anyway,both are not comparable.A Formula Race Car has a much lower center of gravity and much less weight.At the Sepang track with your Porsche you start braking before the 250m mark to make it safely through Turn 1.In a Formula Renault car you brake at the 100m mark once you have learned how to control the car.Corner speed in a Formula Car is higher than what you ever can do in your Porsche.The G-Force and adrenalin rush is absolutely different.</p>
              <p>Sorry Speedjunkie,but in comparison,driving your Porsche in Sepang is like your everyday boring sex.Driving a Formula Car is so exciting,you will never forget.</p>

              <p>I have heard there is a new company in Singapore which allows
              people with a valid driving license to drive a Formula Race Car at
              the Sepang F1 Circuit.</p>
              <p>Have seen the Formula BMW race during the F1 event in Singapore
              and would love to drive such a car by myself.</p>
              <p>Anybody knowing about this company,please post the details.Have
              tried to find them on the web with no success.</p>

              <p>they'll make you sign a legal document so that when you kill yourself they won't kana any responsibility..............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>with no proper training it's impossible to drive a F1 car............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's not even possible for a novice to drive a F1 car in a straight line...............some Arab prince tried a Renault F1 car a few years back and he crashed heavily while driving in a straight line.............LOL</p>

              <p>These cars are now so safe,it will be pretty difficult to kill yourself .</p>
              <p>Watch Mark Webber's Crash in Valencia.He just got out of the car and walked away without a scratch.</p>
              <p>Yeah,impossible for somebody who isn't an experienced race driver,to drive a Formula 1 Car.That's why I think we talk here about a Formula Renault Car and not a Renault Formula 1 Car</p>

              <p>Actually not such much power.Google "Formula Renault" and you will find nice pictures of these cars.look like a formula 1 car and you will look like a real race  driver  when you sit in one of them.</p>
              <p>The cars have around 120 horsepower.Therefore everybody who can drive a road car will be able to drive them on a race track with some guidance.</p>
              <p>But with very low weight and low center of gravity,these cars are a hell of a fun to drive.</p>
              <p>And no way you will be able to drive a real F1 car.They have 900 horsepower with the same low weight and low center of gravity.There is a place in France where you can try this out with old Arrow F1 Cars,but it will cost you around 25.000$......</p>
              <p>Even after 1 day of trying,you will get max to 20% of what such a car can do in terms of braking,acceleration and corner speeds.You pay 25.000$ and get a max value of 5.000$.Better pay 5.000$ for a Formual Renault drive and even as a novice,get up to 80% of what the car can do.The remaining 20% is for race drivers.</p>

              <p>Oh, hang on - Formula Renault.  Took long enough to get that important detail out.</p>
              <p>Hang on - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>FIVE GRAND</strong></span> for a drive in a Formula Renault?! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"> Christ almighty, what a rip-off!</p>
              <p>Just to put things into perspective: with FF2000, you get a 125hp engine driving your car up to 250km/h, and you can run an entire season for less than 20 grand if you know what you're doing.  Oh yeah, and you'll be racing, not cruising on the track by yourself like some ponce.</p>
              <p>Think about it: 20 grand for a season of racing, 5 grand for one afternoon playing Miss Daisy. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>My younger brother races Go-Karts in Asia and I know my dad spends more than 20 Singapore Grands for one season (5 races) on this.Without traveling and hotel costs.</p>
              <p>One year racing in Formula BMW Pacific will set you back with <strong>200 EURO GRANDS</strong></p>
              <p>How is it possible to have 1 year racing in a Formula series for 20 Singapore Grands ? My bro would love to hear more about this.I am perfectly fine with paying 5000 SGD for what is comparable to a Formula BMW drive.</p>
              <p>And Arcade ? Isn't this like peepshow versus the real thing ?????</p>
