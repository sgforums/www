To me it was expensive and depreciation of its value is too fast, unlike in neighbouring Malaysia.<br><br>It all changed when my wife and I started our family.  Taking the MRT and buses were not at all convenient (plus the fact that people were fighting for seats with her ...??), we decided to put the money into a car.  Yes, it was throwing the money down the drain but it was a price (abeit a high price) to pay for convenience and flexibility.<br><br>Now my son is 9 months old and we discovered that with the car, we were able to travel according to his time.  In between meals, sleeping time and when it rains ... a la CNY this year, we were still able to travel to our relative's homes quite pleasantly.<br><br>We did not get a big car.  We got our car for S$72K in March 2003, paid a depo of S$52K and took the minimum 20K loan (standard for Toyotas).  Early this week, I just prepaid the balance of my loan.  Not that I am rich but my money in the bank is not doing anything.  Anyway, I want to start saving for my kid in the future.<br><br>My advice to those who plan to buy a car.  If you see this as a need for your family, do it.  But buy within your means.  I must admit that there were days when I wished I had taken a longer loan and went for an Audi or even a Mercedes Benz.  I guess it was not meant to be.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> </div></blockquote>agree with you.  the need for a car really comes when you have a kid.<br><br>you did the correct thing by buying an affordable car which met your needs and doesn't burn such a big hole in you and your missus' pockets</div>
