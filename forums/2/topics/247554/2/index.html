            <div class='col-md body'>Nowadays alot of these stupid things happens. Not only on the drivers but also the pedestrain.<br><br>Just yesterday morning, I was exiting a carpark @ hougang Central. The moment the front car turned left into the main road, I moved and follow the same. Keeping about 1 meter space between us as we just moved off from stop line. 1 sec after I start to move off , an auntie from the left side pushing a market trolley just walked and cross in front of me. She did not even slow down or stop to check road clear just proceed at the same pace. I jammed brake and horn that stupid auntie brainless head. but she still bo chap, act blur and just kept walking like nobody business. <strong>Just only 15 steps from where she is crossing is a blardy zebra crossing</strong>.<br><br>I unwind my window and shouted at that auntie. " You want to die... go find a bus or lorry .. sure die faster. Want to die.. die far far away from my car. Go die at somebody else car. ". All in Hokiens... But the auntie still bo chap just walk as though she is the king of road.<br><br>Some people are totally brainless and find their life worthless...</div>
