            <div class='col-md body'>but... you also cannot blame them. they seek help for the ECU problem from japan direct i believe... and if they also are at the moment dun have a solution yet, the dealer here also cannot much. this kind of situation happens to almost all dealers. So now you can't do much lor. what exactly is the problem with the ecu? if its still drivable and not compromising ride safety, then it should still be alright for normal driving conditions. if the problem is affecting the particular batch of cars, then i'm sure once they have the solution, they will contact you to arrange a date for you to bring the car in and have the problem retified  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow that's bad... in that case you can make some pretty big noise to them and have them get u a replacement car or something. my guess is that they need to update the ECU programming... but just that either they are still working on it or have yet to reach the dealer. I suppose the Forester is actually a fine car, just happen so this batch of cars u choose got struck with  a particular problem.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi , it ok .....<br><br>The ar have clock around 2120++km already. The ECU just dont work properly. Meaning that we you step full on the gas, the car just won' t respond to it. Must step around for more than 10 sec then all of a sudden the car then will respond. When going some gentle slope, the car speed will just stuck at 40km/h or less no matter hard the gas is stepped........Until now the car still have a very slow reaction meaning when you step more on the gas, it takes more than 5 sec to respond it, when the respond come, it is a very sudden respond. And my mom just very pissed of lor.....Subaru service seriously cannot make it........<br><br>Can I know what type of petrol you pump? Because the advisor say if pump 98 the problem won't arise, but the technical say nothing to do with the petrol...Sometime just felt that the service center is sort of trying to get things done for the sake of getting it done. They just alway say that all the forester have this problem. They say they have no solution to this problem. On the average the car must be back to the service center once every week to upload the patch to the ECU. Its like ridiculous lor, alway must be back to the service center..........<br><br>Hai~~~~somehow my mom very regret of getting this car.........<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well at least they are trying to help, better than rejecting you straight when they have no solution at all. Service advisors usually know nuts about technical stuff... so it's best to approach the mechanics or workshop supervisor to get a better depth of the problem.<br><br>Tell you frankly... my Mini side also having such a situation  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  the '05 Cooper S Auto stalling problem has been bugging us since last year. And BMW/Mini customers have far less patience than you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  So far... we have received a new ECU programming update and we're seeing less and less of such problems coming back....<br><br>... but now we're seeing the JCW Cooper S being affected as well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Like i had mentioned before, i'm sure they are also waiting for a new ecu update. you dun really have much of a choice but to wait OR demand a courtesy car from them. really. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually is really a pissed off, I totally agrees with your that their sales rep does know clearly on the car spec. Seriously really admit SUAY..............<br><br>And guess what, your know that Subaru alway conduct a  talk for new subaru owner and I did attend. Not only forester have problem in fact all other model have their own indivdual problem. Everytime I when back to the service center, confirm there will be some more scolding their car advisor......Seriously really reflect on how "GOOD" the company is lor......</div>
