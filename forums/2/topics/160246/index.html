            <div class='col-md body'>Ok guys, following on from my earlier post (http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=15931<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, just wanted to see what you all thought.<br><br>Been looking around these past couple of days with my wife for the car and currently, I would say there are 3 choices. These are listed below in order of (my wife's) preference:<br><br>08/08/2003 Toyota Harrier 2.4GL<br>OMV - $36,830<br>COE - $32,799<br>PARF - $23,939<br>Mileage - 65,000km<br>Asking Price - $94,000<br><br>NEW Nissan Cefiro 230JM<br>Asking Price - $95,500<br><br>Dec 2002 BMW 318i<br>Mileage - 20,000km<br>Asking Price - $86,000<br><br>I have three questions: (1) Bearing in mind that I'm likely to sell the vehicle after 2-3 years, which would you buy (is the Harrier's mileage a little on the high side?)? (2) If I got the Harrier, how much would you reckon (ball park figure) I would get back if I sold the car after 2 or 3 years (I am still not sure how to calculate. Am very confused now.)? and (3) How much would I get back if I sold that new Cefiro after 2-3 years?<br><br>Many, many, many thanks in advance, kind sirs/ladies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not sure if i were in ur position .. whether i would consider the 3 cars u did..<br><br>but if i had to make a choice between them.. i would take the cefiro.. and budget a bit more for petrol..<br><br>myself i would prolly plumb for the honda accord (sedan) , peugeot 307 (hatch) or the honda odyssey/mitsubishi grandis (mpv)<br><br>the jap cars should fetch fair resale value while the 307 is there as an option. the mpvs were also thrown in becoz.. especially in the case of the odyssey.. its pretty car like in its looks and in driving it..<br><br>oh.. i might be mistaken but i think there might be a surcharge if u pay off the full amount in cash.. if it is really the case.. u might wanna work out if paying the surcharge or taking a minimal 2 yr loan might be more worth it..<br><br>cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I did take a look at all three usual suspects, Honda Accord 2.4, Toyota Camry 2.4 and Nissan Cefiro 230JM.

The Toyota was a little too boring for my liking and the Nissan was better equipped for a similar price.<br><br>Didn't really consider any of the French cars cause I preferred to have something a little easier to sell off (perception still matters). My wife had a Renault which we just sold off and I lost exactly 50% of the value over 3 years (Only 17k on the odometer).<br><br>As for MPVs, I don't think I'm ready to admit that I'm a family man yet. haha. Would prefer something that doesn't really scream "soccer mom/dad".<br><br>I know my choices are a strange mix but we liked the Harrier cause of the design and space, the Nissan for the features (and the fact that we could buy one new, rather than 2nd hand), and the Beemer cause the price looks pretty good for the car (plus the fact that I like Beemers).</div>

The one car that really caught my eye was the Subaru Forester 2.5XT(A).
