              <p>SG tp should be ripped off their tittle!</p>
              <p>Been seeing so many TP, esp those on the honda class 2 bikes speeding like the road is their playground even when they are not chasing anyone! In addition, they changes lane at such high speed without signaling and checking blind spots! So what if they are wearing uniform? So what if they have that blinking siren light? So the more they should behave and only speed when it is needed , esp when they are in the uniform! They have been catching us for minor offenses and charging us a bomb even to the extend of being jailed, should they reflect abit on themselves?</p>

              <p>I get what you mean. I used to be with the SCDF paramedics and we got all sorts of memo, mostly a result from complainers all around. e.g:-</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Siren cannot be on all the time. Only switch on when needed. (Understandable)<br></li>
              <li>When strobe light is off, drive 50km/h on the left most lane. (WTF?)</li>
              <li>Do not park at the handicap lot. (Even though its an emergency... WTF?)</li>
              <li>Driver have to be in the ambulance at all time when buying lunch / dinner. Also means no parking at any parking lot. (Another wtf)<br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>There's a lot more which I can't really recall. But thats how things are in civil service. People always complain about us and then new directives will have to be applied. Quite annoying.</p>
              <p>Few months before I left, we're not allowed to run red lights anymore. Not at all, even though its a critical case. I think there should be a solid rule that we all have to give way to ambulance.</p>

              <p>"....How do you know that they are speeding? You have a radar in your vehicle?" Do you have a class 3 lisence? When i'm travelling at 60 which is speed limit , do I need a radar to track what speed they are going at when they zoom pass me? Perhaps, I suggest you switch on your common sense before you start barking. <br><br>Last of all , your comment is not appreciated.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It's my thread so Your comment is not appreciated. You were asking me if I'd a radar with me to indicate that they a re speeding, so I'm replying you that common sense will tell me that they are speeding. In addition "...When i'm travelling at 60 which is speed limit " means I'm travelling at 60km/hr , in what way have I not made myself clear? Perhaps, you should enroll yourself in an english school to polish up your inference and reading skills. FYI i'm 19 year old, just passed  TP 4 month ago, you wanna meet up, sure why not? I'm heading down PG this aug 12 for a race. Welcome you here, if not , just be quiet, stop barking. My thread does not welcome you.</p></div>

Don't usually speed in sg. And FYI if you have not been on track, speeding on track is perfectly fine. Or perhaps your cheap ride couldn't get you far? Haha!<br><br>"..But to tell you that not all TP officers are like what you say." FYI i said "..<strong>so many TP</strong>, esp those on the honda class 2 bikes speeding " I said so many, i never say all TP. Seriously , I see no point argueing with you. Might as well sleep now and prepare for school tml. Just call me 96991673 if you would care for a race at PG with perhaps some rented wrx? Go check out my post on my TS on this forum before you start barking with some ride you could never afford in your life time.

              <p>I understand your point. But the truth is people speed and I admit, I do so sometimes as well. Of course what I stated will never happen at all in Sg.</p>
              <p>Just that my point is lets say a TP hides in some obscure place and catches a whole load of speeders. Ok, but at that time, those speeders do not know that there's a TP there and will still just  speed to whereve they are going, thereby being a possible danger to other motorists, until he reaches his destination. By the time he gets the letter from the TP, the "damage" has already been done. Its like you shit your pants already then you go find toilet.</p>
              <p>However, if the TP is standing at some more obvious location like an overhead bridge, then those speeding can see him and may take action to slow down their vehicle, thereby driving within the speed limit. The presence of the TP will, in this case, deter speeding on the spot. If people still blur blur speed then just too bad for them.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>While i was in Seoul Korea last mth i notice there's an understanding between motorist and the Police there.Example if you're a sudent havint study late at night and have to rush to college in the morning just call them and they will gladly escort you plus they will stick a note at the rear and side window stating that "I'm rushing for my exams,Thank You for giving way".That would be in cars,Vans,Lorries,Motorbikes whatsoever..I'm quite surprised to see the driving culture there unlike here where egos and selfishness is almost in every motorist mindset.There even a Ferrari would give way if you're late in going somewhere,Just hand gesture and hazard lights will do!</p></div>
