              <p>Yes, but you have to understand their culture. Their college exams also very stressful, with tens of thousands of applicants fighting for a few places. The exam period is at a certain period of time each year, and they do know that if they abuse the system, they will spoil the market and cause others to lose the privilege..</p>
              <p>You must remember that not every culture is like Singapore, with the 'Me First' and 'Me Only' syndrome which serves to extract the best possible privileges and benefit for oneself even if it means at the expense of others.</p>
              <p>This is why motoring here is not as pleasant as other countries. Don't have to say so far until Korea. Even up north, I daresay quite a far bit of Msian drivers are a heck load more gracious than local ones.</p>

              <p>Maybe our driving centres might want to tweak their syllabuses to focus on graciousness and defensive driving skills rather than just imparting the technical knowledge of driving. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
