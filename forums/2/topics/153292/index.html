            <div class='col-md body'>Come on guys, don't u think that your views are too simplistic and naive. That will not entirely happen. The cold hard truth is that the current economic structures in  the world cannot be sustained without fuel. Any deviance away frm the reliance of crude oil fuel is not forseeable in the near future.<br><br>I agree with the escalating fuel prices it really sucks but afterall, its is undeniable that fuel is a basic nessasity that we csimply cannot live without. It has to and will continue to be consumed.<br><br>I just hope that this oil crisis of sorts brings home the point of being serious in seeking a viable long term subsitute for crude oil and not be entirely dependent on crude fuel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oil is not a perishable product, and can be stored for infinite period of time. So what if everyone doens't buy fuel for one day?? We will still need them the next day, the day after next and so on. If no one buys the stuff, oil companies just need to store the inventories somewhere and order cut in production.<br><br>In short, you can dun buy petrol for one day.

            <div class='col-md body'>CNA has already reported that high oil prices will not be sustainable for a long period of time. Because in the long run, very few people will pump petrol because it will not be that affordable. OPEC will be forced to lower oil prices and thus petrol prices back to normal.<br><br>The reason for high oil prices is not because of the shortage of oil. 20 years ago, researches said that the crude oil will be able to last us for 30 years but yet, a few years back, with DOUBLE the population, they said it would last for another 50-70years.<br><br>USA is now in control of the middle east. Hence therefore in control of the oil prices too. USA is also in heavy debt because of the $$$ the borrowed for the Iraq war and thus taking opportunity to get $$ from the rest of the world. The currency of USA also drop so that their debt becomes 'cheaper' because the $$ borrowed will be closed to a 1:1 ratio. So when they pay off their heavy debt. Price will go down down down...<br><br>I hate the most powerful man in the world!
