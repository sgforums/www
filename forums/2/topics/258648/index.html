            <div class='col-md body'>In the case of any accident in MY, 1st you need to report to the local police within 24 hours. I will give you a few scenarios (based on someone hit u from behind)<br><br>1) If say the damage is less than RM400, if you report police, and that person don't, the person will automatically get a summon of RM300 plus his NCB gone, the person might might not be able to renew  road tax. But you can't claim from the person's insurance becos the amount is too small<br><br>2) If the damage is less than RM400, both of you report, the person will also get a summon of RM300 for causing accident, but you can't claim the person's insurance becos of the small amount<br><br>3)If damage is over RM400, you report, but the other person did not, the person will automatically get a RM300 summon, plus you can claim from the person's insurance<br><br>4) If damage is over RM400, both of you report, that person will also get a RM300 summon, plus you can claim from the person's insurance.<br><br>So if the damage is under RM300, most pple will settle between themselves. Why I say RM300 is becos there's no difference between getting a summon and paying you. So say if that person decided to give you RM290 instead of RM300, just take it.<br><br></div>
