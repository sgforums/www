Not a Trueno. Owner or ex-owner renewed the COE for onli 5 yrs.

Then, to slowly restore it slowly by myself to new car condition, not to race. Have engine overhauled, port polish and blueprinted. make the 86 like a collector's car. Interior restored. Sometimes a lot of parts can be found on ebay.<br><br>Parts wise, is it possible for 86 owners 2 share and bring in half-cuts.? Cannablise for parts?<br><br>So before you sprayed the current b&amp;w colour scheme, were there any rust spots to take care of? My past experience with old cars are once rust starts its very hard to eliminate. spreads like a diease.<br><br>Wah lau can go on the whole day man... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
