If u got 88-89 becos of the 15 yr COE then i can explain. it is becos COE was implemented later than that...therefore the car was running around in Sg for a few years already before COE was implemented.<br><br>$24K cash plus subsequent years of servicing and maintenence costs. after 5 yrs u left with 0 dollars and some scrap metal.<br><br>New car got resale value and end of 10 yrs can get back money too. Yearly depreciation is less than 6k too.<br><br>But of course i am not scolding u. I bought it myself didnt i? but dont buy it thinking its cheap..its not cheap if u do all the math..its expensive.i bought it becos i love it. its my dream car. Even if i am earning 10K a month. this will still be my fav car. Maybe buy another 7 seater for my family. but this is ultimately my car.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you there!!! I've also seen a few levins and the rare trueno on the roads before... mostly near the PS area... but I really love this car too... it's small enough for Singapore roads and yet still good to drive... that is, if I ever get to drive it... hehe...

In its stock form(remember this is in 1983, 20 yrs ago) it gives a powerful 130BHP combined with its light weight body of 960Kg. Together it has LSD and is a rear wheel drive. In its time...this car is like what a Skyline GTR 34 is to us to day.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The old-birds in the club say there was another 1 even more powerful than his, a Mercedes Vito. But it was sold not long ago, never get to listen to itz powerful beats. Not all of us got tat much cash to spare to spend on ICE like car owners, tatz why we opt for diesel powered vans.<br><br>As for the Caddys, they run on turbo diesel. Installing a BOV in a turbo diesel engines doesn't help. So either wat you heard is from another vehicle or I didn't catch the "psst" sound bcos itz too soft even if they drag the gears all the way. Unless they go and install the HKS Diesel BOV, then got the "psst" sound, but so far, none, cos too expensive.</div>
