Come to think of it, it is also the only car I driven, other than those test-drivings and driving lessons. After 4 years of no driving, any car feels good, especially when it is your own.<br><br>So far I am just trying to faimilar myself with my car. Knowing when to up and drop gear takes time, and tries. Taking passengers is also another learning curve. Like Takumi who drive hard when he is alone, but is also able to produce smooth driving for his passengers.<br><br>Presently, mileage is only 2000km. Handling still fine, lucky no rain so far. Comfort, good, except for the vibration when I feel when I push the car wrongly. Road noise, can't heard, music too loud. Feel, nice. Add-on, not much yet, except for the K&amp;N filter, still running in engine.<br><br>Solar film, mine is fitted with Rikecool. Film is fine, but can't say the same for worksmanship. Their after-service still OK, know the friendly sale/boss can already.<br><br>Mine is Kelisa, by the way!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got my new Lancer manual (sports) a few days back too.  The smell of a new car is .... ar...... can't describe. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Fog Lights<br>Thought Sports Version comes with fog lights, but mine doesn't. I'm a bummer that didn't check and confirm before purhcase. Only the Auto Sports version comes with fog lights. Potential Lancer buyers might wanna take note.<br><br>Anyway, heard from SE that it is prohibited to switch on the fog lights in SG. Any fog lights, any time of the day. But TP generally quite flexible. Just switch it off when TP asks you to and you'll be fine, unless you've got $150 to spare.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I.C.E.<br>The stock sound system is kind of a letdown. Sound seems to be generated only from the rear speakers, although there are 2 speakers in front as well. Maybe i need to twiddle the console a bit more for adjustments. Any tip?<br><br>FC<br>Managed to hit 13.1km/l on my first full tank. Is this high or low? Mine is still in the run-in period. Hope the mileage gets better after that. I keep RPM between 2k to 2.5k. As soon as it nears 3k, I'll hit the gears.<br><br>Ioniser<br>Bought one ioniser that costs $25 and plug it into the lighter socket. Heard that it sort of "kills" bad/foul air and leaves the car smelling fresh and clean.<br><br>My question is, "How do you know if it really works, apart from the fact that the car is smell-free?" Considering mine is a new set of wheels, that's not difficult to achieve. I dun wanna load my car with junk smell just to test if the ioniser works. Too much of a risk.<br><br>Are there any simple way to test whether the ioniser truly works, or is it just a decorative piece with lights on that makes a light buzzing sound?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Conclusion<br>Absolutely no regrets getting the Lancer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
