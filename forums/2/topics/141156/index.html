            <div class='col-md body'>At 0230 hours on July 9th, 2005, I drove into this petrol station in Sengkang.<br><br>This guy came up to me and I said "good morning". He just looked at me and said "huh?"<br><br>I just shook my head and said, "98 full please". After he finished filling up, he carelessly removed the nozzle from the tank opening of my car and it dripped all over my bumper.<br><br>I had to tell him what had happened before he was even aware. No matter, he then took a watering can and proceeded to wash out the tank opening with water without first securing the cap on it! I had to almost shout to make him stop.<br><br>Me: Is this your first day?<br>Attendant: No it's my second.<br>Me: What if the water went into my tank and something rusts? You going to pay for that?<br>Attendant: Huh?<br><br>I just walked away into the reception area and asked for the shift manager, was then told the shift manager was not on shift.<br><br>What the hell? Never mind, I explained what happened.<br><br>The cashier told me he was new.<br><br>Me: So you're saying that a newly and apparently poorly trained staff does not know what he's doing and is still allowed to handle potentially explosive fuels?<br>Cashier: Er...why don't you call my manager?<br><br>As I left I realized that this same guy was coiling up the air pump hoses by first holding one end, walking far away from the pump and laying it on the ground in one straight line. Really good idea for a car to drive over it to damage the hoses, or some guy to trip over it.<br><br>Now, should I call up the shift manager in the morning to complain or just let it go?</div>
