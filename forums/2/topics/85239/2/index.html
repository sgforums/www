            <div class='col-md body'>Oh goosh, mine is a shameful experience. Passed after 5 times, at Ubi<br><br>1st Test. Crank Course strike curb, never mind still got chance. Then at T junction turning right, see one L plate car dunno very far move like tortoise, i go and then suddenly that car speed up. I slam brake and realise tester hand is on my handbrake. Immediate Failure<br><br>2nd Test. Tester sup er ngeow. At a cross jucntion two L plate cars infront of me. After the junction suppose to drive into a crank course. First car infront buay zai cannot got in crank course, second car stop behind it, then my car stop, swee swee at pedestrian crossing. - 8 10 pts. Sian liao. Then he shouted at me, "overtake lah" and he initially ask to follow those car to the crank course. Wah kaoz, the rest isn't easy for me liao. Points more 30.<br><br>3rd Test. After 2 years of break and Advanced Theory expired. Take test again. Take it for granted. In circuit, basically tester writing board is place infront of the car, then he even skip some of the circuit test. Went on road, i happy liao, thought gonna passed. Then tester take the writing board and started writing. Even point out to me my mistake all along my instructor never correct me, engine break 1st instead of free gear and brake. Points more than 20<br><br>4th Test. High fever, take panadol b4 test, blur blur but decide to give it a shot. Circuit ok, on the road ok until one road(never drive b4), where the second lane must turn right, go straight instead. Alamak, immediate failure loh.<br><br>5th Test. Tester look very fierce. When in circuit, told me this "Relax, took so many times already, should be ok one". Circuit everything ok. On road, tester like racer guy, want me to loot the car to 70km/h on a particular road. See amber light also ask me to loot. Wah, the rest you know lah.<br><br>Lucky i passed, if not, really wanted to quit already. I would advice those learning to take up school one, better coz theory test got mob test, rebooking of pratical test also faster.</div>
