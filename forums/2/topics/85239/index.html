            <div class='col-md body'>This is amazing. I enjoyed reading the posts, seriously.<br><br>It was really how I felt.<br><br>Ok, bad news, my test is next week Thursday, 1.55pm. I'm a private student.<br><br>I'm going to the circuit for another 2 times (total 4) before my test....and I aint confident of passing.. i mean.. my private instructor in Kallang doesnt give any helpful comments, he nags and nags and screams and makes you panic and he doesnt wait for your actions... he screams too early and he has kinda no confidence in his students. I aint the only one being yelled at...<br><br>Sometimes I scream back at him telling him that I AM A STUDENT, ITS NOT WRONG TO MAKE MISTAKES. And he would shut up for the next 40 minutes leaving an eerie silence in the car. And for the next 40 minutes would be perfect driving, no mistakes with parking or road driving... but if i fail to do something he'd tell me nicely..<br><br>Of course I'm nervous about next week Thursday's test..<br><br>What about the testers? I was told by my friend that afternoon tests are usually taken by the young testers while mornings would be the old birds...<br><br>Is this true? And does the tester keep his cool or does he scream at you?<br><br>I hope somebody replies soon *twiddle* thanks! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
