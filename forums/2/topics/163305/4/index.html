Racing in circuits and road driving is somewhat different... both have a different purpose, so there's nothing wrong in starting at a young age, as long as it's on a Go kart, in a track supervised with experienced people...<br><br>And to the other guy up there... There's nothing more important than experience when you're driving... you don't even have that...<br>The point here is that it is NOT very safe to drive anywhere without a valid license... If anything happens, he damages the car, other injures anyone... ultimately not only will he himself get into trouble, but he will also implicate his father for not ensuring that his son doesn't get access to the car... In the end, both father and son will get charged...<br><br>I've already seen one incident where this L plater tried to make a U turn at the road outside the entrance to Ubi Center... that road is a two way road, but single lane each direction, plus, his instructor wasn't in the car when he did that illegal U turn... He nearly rammed into the other cars parked at the side, as well as held up traffic behind him... after that, one of the other instructors came up to him and gave him a scolding... So you still want to say L platers can concentrate on the road? Sure, they concentrate SO hard that they make other mistakes like that... illegal U turn in a blind corner leh... you think it's very safe?<br><br>You say those who have licenses are driving subconsciously... you never heard of practice makes perfect? Muscle memory? We don't have to concentrate on just the road... when driving outside, you have to be aware of everything going on around you... 360 degrees... not just what's in front of you... You'll never understand that until you get your license and start driving on the real roads...</div>

Hope that you've learnt your lesson and will not do it again until you've got the official training and permission k?<br><br>Past is past and now let's all move on to the present. TTS should know that he's wrong seeing that he's kept quiet for the past 2 days. Now all that we can ask of you is for you to patiently wait till you are becoming of age to go for your on-road license.<br><br>Though we would all hate to keep repeating to you the sentence that we've all heard through our and your life, still this has to be done *sigh*. Listen to us cos " It's for your own good."<br><br>Heng, hope you will not hold it too dear to him if he's ready to repent. Perhaps give him other things to do about cars to lead him on the right path.<br>TTS, do what i do when i didn't had the age to learn driving at first, try cleaning the car for your pops or maybe follow him to the workshop and learn more about the internals at first. Perhaps you could find someone that could give u a lift around and explain to you more about the fundamentals of cars. There's no rush in hopping into one just yet. Once you've done all the essentials about car maintenance/tuning, you'll really appreciate and understand more when you can start driving it. *That really helped me alot and fueled my passion for cars as a whole last time*<br><br>Lastly, do not be afraid and shun away from us tho for we all still here to readily answer all your qualms. Seeing all these should've made you release that we are here to guide u and help each other out of concern and not here to just flame you ya? Take care!</div>
