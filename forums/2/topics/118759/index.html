            <div class='col-md body'>public transport will the most cost you $200. If that is consider expensive I got nothing to say. Petrol alone is more than that... For an ESI the fuel consumption is around the range of 10-12. The road tax and insurance will cost you a whole year of your course fee and the monthly installment will cost you all your monthly allowance..... It is really not worth being a slave to a car at such age. Problems may arise from car sharing.... like maintain cost, repair cost, the usage of the car....<br><br>Cheers.</div>

Get back to your books! After reading through my simple math, you still don't get it. Out of the 1k I quote per month in my pervious posting, only 230 dollar is for the car price.<br><br>That car stated above, even with your 15k, you still need to top up 10k. meaning you will save S$80 per month. 920/3=306!!! Even if the car is free, you still have to cough out S$250 a month, just for that damn 2nd - hand car.<br><br>I don't know where did you get your 15k from, but that amount of money can last you on a 3-4months tour around Europe. Do yourself and your parents a favour, STOP dreaming. Talk about it after you serve your NS.</div>
