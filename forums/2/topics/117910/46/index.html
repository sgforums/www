            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Tedz,<br><br>Sorry to hear about your little accident. I got into a slight fender bender just last month too, luckily the other car's bumper hit me underneath my wheel arch, so the damage is quite unnoticeable unless you look really close. Same thing, other driver blame it on me, ask me to learn to drive better... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Point is, just want to share with all you people here (abit late for Tedz but maybe useful to others here, sorry Tedz  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ), I learnt that there's no point in blaming each other for the accident, cos the outcome won't be decided by that. If the other driver is at fault, and doesn't want to settle on the spot, then you can take down his license plate and IC nbr and file a report. YOUR NCB WILL NOT BE AFFECTED if the insurance company claims against his insurance, so you have nothing much to lose by filing a report. In fact if you don't file a report, and the other party does, then you will most likely be held responsible for the damages because it would appear that you are trying to hide something. So remember, if you are quite sure that the other party is at fault (once the accident occurs, try to think carefully who has right of way instead of screaming your head off at the other driver), then explain to him that you are willing to settle this on the spot to save both of you the trouble of filing a report. If he refuses, then take down his license plate (name and ic if possible, some people may not coorperate), then file a report within 24hrs. Best if you have a camera, take a photo of his car license plate at the location of the accident so that he cannot deny it (camera phone can come in real handy here). DUN BE BULLIED INTO THINKING THAT THE ACCIDENT WAS YOUR FAULT SO YOU SHOULD PAY HIM MONEY. Even if you give him money he can still file a report and claim damages against you. So just tell the other driver firmly that you are not going to pay him any money because its not your fault, and that you are going to file a report, and let him know that if he doesn't file one too then he will most likely have to pay for all the damages. You can leave the accident location after you have gotten his license plate, no need to stand there and let him continue to blame you, but its advisable to go straight to Tan Chong to report the accident.<br><br>I also agree that's its important to keep a cool head after the accident, cos it'll help you to think straight once its happened. Think of it this way, your car is already damaged, so no amount of shouting is going to make it disappear, might as well try to make the best of it and let your insurance company handle the rest, so FILE A REPORT! It may take a while but it sure beats having to fork out your own money to pay for the damage.<br><br>BTW I also didn't manage to get the other driver's license plate that time, can you believe I took a photo of her car plate, then forgot to save it!!! So dumb right? Anyway lucky she didn't bother to file a report, so I just let it go even though my poor March kena scratched. Quite sure if I had filed a report I could have gotten my whole rear bumper changed. Anyhow just to let you all know, you will only lose your NCB if you claim against your own insurance, but there are some circumstances where you may not lose it even if you do claim against your own insurance...I read this in the AIG insurance booklet, and confirmed it with AIG over the phone. For those who are unsure of how an insurance claim works, that booklet is pretty useful (I only read it after I got bumped into... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ).</div>
