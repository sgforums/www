            <div class='col-md body'>hey malathione, welcome to our forum! hope to welcome u n ur family to our march club soon too.....<br><br>ok...this is what one of our club member wrote about the pros n cons of our marchies.....read on...every impressively written!<br><br>hope it helps! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>By KamanRider:<br><br>Cant help being excited when pple wants to know more abt the new marches, so here's my imput.<br><br>first thing first, be very careful when you purchase things by feelings, esp you only do your research for 2 weeks, its a big investment we are talking here (at least to a poor guy like me). i took months and i still got sleepless nights over it then.<br><br>first the "negative" bits:<br><br>1. for the price of this march (plus / minus) you can have many other choices, and i mean many, have you considered them thoroughly?<br><br>2. be prepared to get whacked by friends / relatives / family / colleagues that you are getting something "not value for money". of course shallow sporean's perspective of value is "big", "fierce", "sporty", "resale" and always judging a book by its cover. many cars at this price range are "big, fierce, sporty and better resale".<br><br>3. stock marches dun have leather seats, rear sensors, and......and......thaz it?! and also its not a 1.6L of course.<br><br>4. "the marches trying to look like VW beetle" - this is murmured by the losers<br><br>5. the handling needs to be improved if you are a sporty guy<br><br>6. boot space is small - cannot deny if you compare with non hatch back cars<br><br>7. TC service is crap - some (not all) said<br><br>8. 2005 got more new cars coming out, dun want to wait and see?<br><br>thaz abt all that i can quickly think of. and if you are still not frightened off, read on, cos the following are the good stuff:<br><br>1. the march is NOT small, its a visual misconception, go in one and sit and try it, you will know why i say this. its Compact yet Spacious. the new march is shorter than the old march but the wheel base is longer, it is also taller and wider, all these translates into more spacious interior and leg room. it was designed for european market in mind, ang moh reviewers from reputable magazines also say the space is commendable. lastly check out kingmariot, he's a big guy, ask him.<br><br>2. the new march won the prestigious 2002 designers award in the paris car show, awarded by 100 over professionals and designers. some criterias were originality, creativity, clever and practical design, characters, features etc. so if you find that you cant explain why you are so suddenly hooked on this car, the look, the inexplicable warmth and the sense of homeliness, do not be alarmed, most of us here have somehow felt the same in various degrees. its an "x-factor".<br><br>3. the march has the most powerful 1.4L engine in the market. at 98bhp, it even beats the ass off many 1.5L. with minor mod, it can be on par with some 1.6L, this is what i call value for money.<br><br>4. the elegance has features that can shame many bigger cars, its the rolls royce of the superminis. just in case you havent done the research, it has among its array of toys, keyless entry and ignition, auto climate control, plasmacluster, auto lighting, speed sensing wiper, clever compartments, active and passive features like ABS, EBD, Brake Assist, 6 x air bags, reinforced body etc among others.<br><br>5. good FC average between 13 to 16 km/L among the marchies here. this is the result of new alloy materials piston and block which are lighter, jointly developed by nissan and renault. and.... whatever they do to the engine.....the full tank, i think its 41L, so at $1.4/L currently, it costs $57 and can run you off for abt 600km +/- depending on how you drive.<br><br>6. head turner on the roads, a good form of ego booster and for picking up girls (i dunno what young chicks like nowadays, maybe bigger cars?), but exercise with caution if you already have gf.<br><br>7. not sure about buying/selling second hand, the car is abt 2 yrs old in spore, maybe you dun see many pple selling its becos they dun want to part with their marches? but franky, if you want to buy this car already with the intention of selling so quickly, i suggest you first choose your purchase wisely and cautiously. again dun buy on impulse. or be safe, buy one with high resale value.<br><br>8. lastly the new march has a lovely community which is growing healthily. the pple here are lovely and helpful and somehow they always come in peace.<strong></strong><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gonna get the new red color. She really likes it. Getting the elegance one. Actually reserved one already. Hope we are not too impulsive. Am driving a cefiro 200jk myself, so am quite comfortable with the nissan styling and interior. If nothing goes wrong, will get it tomorrow. Found out that the interest rate is gonna be 2.5% for 7 years instead of 2.2% as of 1/3/05, so gotta rush to get it.</div>

It was handed over to me two Fridays ago and I have been busy admiring it and playing with it. I think I should hit my 1st 1k this week so getting excited to send my car for servicing soon.... However, I think I will be receiving a letter from LTA this week as I beat the red light two days after collecting my car. Not my fault actually..... I was waiting at the junction to make a right turn but the traffic was heavy with a lot of incoming vehicles blocking my path. When it was my turn to make a right turn, I could not turn at all as my path was obstructed by the oncoming vehicles (they should not be in the junction box at all). When I was eventually able to make a right turn, I saw that the right turn traffic signal has been changed to yellow and subsequently red. When I travelled pass the traffic light, I saw the traffic camera flashing away and thats when I know that my fate has been sealed with a 12 points deduction and S$200 fine..... Will probably lodge a complaint to LTA as I was really caught in no man's land at that point of time. If I dun proceed to turn right and continue my journey (though the traffic signal has changed to yellow) after the incoming traffic has been cleared, I would have been obstructing the flow of traffic eventually by staying in the junction box. However, I understand that those bigwigs in LTA will be unlikely to give in to our appeals...Now I just have to wait for the letter to come before I made a trip to LTA and seek a redress....
