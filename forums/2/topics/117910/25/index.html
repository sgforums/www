Guess it might be due to the size of my tyres. They are smaller than most of the new Marchies and also less wide. You would suffer during cornering as you<br>ll hear them screeching when turning at slightly higer speed. But pick up is easier. BTW i don't off aircon when i drive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Its about 9.6km/l. Its only 2 weeks old. Its hard to imagine that cos I have been switching off the aircon at times and also I have been driving at around 50 to 60km/h (super slow, right?) most of the time. Can only remember approaching 80km/h on two or three occasions for extremely short period of time. I didn't floor my accelerator at all and most of the time just step on it lightly. The gear OD mode is switched on so I still dun understand why my fuel consumption is so high...Is this normal? Should I report this problem when I send my vehicle for servicing?<br><br>Also felt very difficult to pick up speed between the 2nd and 3rd gear (from 20 km/h to 70km/h). I have to step on the accelerator extremely hard to pick up speed but still it takes significant amount of time to increase speed by 20 to 30 km/h. Again, is this normal?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div></blockquote>Hi Hi,<br><br>Initially had the same problem with the poor pickup as well in my 1st 2000km... then NYC suggested to floor the accelerator to get the engine in gear... and it works!!

The slope was gently steep. When I was ready to drive on from almost the top of the gradual sloop after applying the foot brake for a minutes, I realised that my car was sliding backwards for some distance the moment I released my foot brake. Really caught me by surprise because I have not encountered such problems before in the past with other cars. Have anyone of you encountered something like this before?<br><br>Looking forward to see all of you on this coming Saturday.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div>

Or at least that works for me. Hmm slope was gently steep?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I realised it also when on slope sometimes will roll back. It depends on the gradient of the slope. So no worries, dunno if you can fix it by adjusting the idling thing? hee hee not technically sound lah. Maybe others can suggest. Yup looking forward to see another big guy this Sat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
