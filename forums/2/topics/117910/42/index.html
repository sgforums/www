Understand your "concern" for the cinnamon colour of your seat but i guess it will grow on you after some time. But Blue is a really nice colour, but so far only one person here have that colour.<br><br>For your question, I guess 220 for front and 230 for back should be sufficient. If i am not wrong someone have similar concerns on this around page 36 or so  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> , too bad cannot do auto search. Anyway hope you can join us for our lil outing to Sentosa this weekend and we can share tips among ourselves.

It says paint protector if i m not wrong. So maybe no need any more sealant. But for me I went for this thing called Toughseal. A lot of Toyota drivers introduce me to it. Dunno if it is a sealant for paint but it claims that those nasty birdshit that is hyper acidic will not attack the paint work and is easily cleaned off. It also discourages you from doing any other form of waxing or polishing, so i went for it. Every now and then you can go back to them and get a car wash and reapplication of the toughseal for $10. So far so good. I think Noot has it done as well. Go to www.toughseal.com.sg if you need any info. There are also other products like Amazing Glaze in the market.</div>
