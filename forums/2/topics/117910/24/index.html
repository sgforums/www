            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>I think my Marchie has the worst fuel consumption level among all of you. Its about 9.6km/l. Its only 2 weeks old. Its hard to imagine that cos I have been switching off the aircon at times and also I have been driving at around 50 to 60km/h (super slow, right?) most of the time. Can only remember approaching 80km/h on two or three occasions for extremely short period of time. I didn't floor my accelerator at all and most of the time just step on it lightly. The gear OD mode is switched on so I still dun understand why my fuel consumption is so high...Is this normal? Should I report this problem when I send my vehicle for servicing?<br><br>Also felt very difficult to pick up speed between the 2nd and 3rd gear (from 20 km/h to 70km/h). I have to step on the accelerator extremely hard to pick up speed but still it takes significant amount of time to increase speed by 20 to 30 km/h. Again, is this normal?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div>

OD is turned on, ie the instrument light at panel "O/D off" is NOT litted<br><br>else, even if the aircond is turned on you shd'nt be getting 9.6km/h, its worst than a 2L car. esp you have been light footed.<br><br>how about try to monitor a while more, if still liddat you shd ask TC to check out your car, think they have the diagnostic tool to check.<br><br>the march is quite zippy in terms of pickup compared to other auto transmissioned cars. i have driven other auto cars for a reasonable amount of time honda accord, jaguar, volvo, cerato, corona, others. the pickup of the march scores much better due to its body-to-weight-ratio. high speed no need to say lar.<br><br>however you cannot compare it to a manual cars, its another kinda game.<br><br>suggest you try to drive other auto cars and feel the comparison, or we check out yours on march 12.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Tweety,<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth, there are others who can achieve 16km/L here. You are running in yr 1st 1000 km... you see higher FC, I can only explain, you are dragging yr 3rd gear too long..50km/60km.! There is no tac. ( RPm ) install in our cars, therefore you cant really drive it like a manual car ... u should try feel and use yr footwork to change gears .... ! The march is a high rev....car! if you are an average driver and dun floor hard.. the car should be changing gears at (1st 15/km ,  2nd 35/km, 3rd 65/km, cruising speed is 80/km to 100/km ) @1500rpm...<br><br>You have to step on half and hold yr foot, to gain bhp, and step on again when you see yr speedo increase  ..! If you floor hard the bhp wont be responsive = more Fuel wasted...! The car is pulling abt 10.2 kg per horse. Our car specs is 98 bhp, weight of the car abt 900plus (just slip out of my mind).. ! ..! The car / (ECU) is just picking up and sensing yr driving habits now..!<br><br>If you head back to TC they might just reset yr ECU again. They might tune yr idling time ... or etc.<br><br>enjoy yr ride and hit 120/km to run in yr car..! for tops..! hehehehe<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm last Friday i spotted a Black March from Upper Thomson Road. Driver was driving very slowly, however i realised his number plate is SFS, so might have collected his car recently. We turned into Mandai Road and into some smaller roads that leads us pass a golf driving range. I tailed the Black marchie for abt 5 minutes and guess the driver must have realised he was being followed as I saw the passenger turing back to look at me. We continued into darker windier roads and just when I thought that no other cars was around, I saw many cars parked at the side of the road only to be litted by the pale moon light  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> . Wow, i never been to this place man, sure looks interesting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> We continued till we are near a roundabout when the driver of the Black March pulled to one side to let me pass. That is when I wind down my window and introduce myself and the club. He was not able to wind down his window but open his door instead as he just have his window film fixed on that day. After a few exchanges, found out that he has just collected his New March on that day. So congratulations man, if you are here Andy, you might wanna check us out and join us for our meetups.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Left him there to enjoy the moonlight and drove off feeling glad that I've tailed him and discover the place where I've never knew.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Also on Sunday, left a note on a Olive Green March at Forum the Galleria so hope that the driver could check us out as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tweety74:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi All,<br><br>I think my Marchie has the worst fuel consumption level among all of you. Its about 9.6km/l. Its only 2 weeks old. Its hard to imagine that cos I have been switching off the aircon at times and also I have been driving at around 50 to 60km/h (super slow, right?) most of the time. Can only remember approaching 80km/h on two or three occasions for extremely short period of time. I didn't floor my accelerator at all and most of the time just step on it lightly. The gear OD mode is switched on so I still dun understand why my fuel consumption is so high...Is this normal? Should I report this problem when I send my vehicle for servicing?<br><br>Also felt very difficult to pick up speed between the 2nd and 3rd gear (from 20 km/h to 70km/h). I have to step on the accelerator extremely hard to pick up speed but still it takes significant amount of time to increase speed by 20 to 30 km/h. Again, is this normal?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div></blockquote>Maybe this is during the run in period lah, monitor it for a couple of weeks and see how. It should get better. Also try using 98 or V power and see how. 9.6km/l is like some 4WD car man. My best record so far was my last top up. Realised I am doing 16.75km/l on Esso 98. Will monitor and see if it remains consistent. Making me think twice abt changing my rims to bigger ones.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
