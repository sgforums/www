            <div class='col-md body'>Hey people, wow so many posts to read...*faint*<br><br>Nice job on the logo NYC, and whoever helped to contribute to the design, I must say it looks really professional! I think it will look great in white rather than black though, against a black background and with the words "Marchiz" embroidered in red. I wouldn't mind paying $20 for a polo tee, would be great to wear a shirt like that to our outings hehe...aren't we all show-offs?<br><br>Popped by the mac at kallang last weekend and saw quite a few minis there, some old and some new...some kind of gathering I guess. Then I remembered seeing Kamen's pictures of your outing to Changi, and immediately thought our cars looked much better...cuter, smarter, and much more lively than theirs. Guess I'm biased haha!<br><br>Hey guys, you couldn't have chosen a 'better' date than 12 March...I'm away from 9 - 13, so I guess I'll have to pass again...argh got meeting but no car, then now got car but not around...something isn't right here.<br><br>NYC, Impul kit $3-4K huh? Think I'll save it and ride my Choco in all her raw beauty for awhile then haha! Maybe get rims first lah...was hoping can strike toto today and buy myself an Impul bodykit, $12 million bucks leh, but it was not meant to be...sigh.<br><br>Hey did I see another Choco owner posting earlier? Yay, same family! Elegance or Comfort? If Comfort then can be twins liao haha!<br>Oh someone looking for sales exec to buy a March? My sales exec gave me free Vkool Mirage system keke! PM me if you're interested in contacting her. She's from Tan Chong Toa Payoh btw...<br><br>I think we need to slow down in the postings leh...I never see for one week and already reach part 3 liao...you guys so lucky got internet access at work, I only get to read when I reach home, and sometimes too shack to read also...see now I posting at this ungodly hour.<br><br>Zzzzzz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Morning everyone, I would like to thank my lucky stars for being able to still post today... Yesterday, while I was on my way to pick up my Mrs, I almost had a nasty accident with a <strong>STUPID</strong> taxi <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> ! What happen was that as I was travelling along Yishun(near Yishun Dam), after negotiating a bend, this taxi(think he was bout to drop his passenger) suddenly pulled over with me so closed behind! My first reaction was to swerve my March to the right(couldn't care less if there was any car on my right) and as the centrifugal force was too much to overcome, I had to swerve it back to the left again then to the right before coming back to the left! At that moment, I was so afraid that the car might just flip over but luckily it did not! All this happen so fast that I didn't even have time to sound my horn or even note down the taxi particulars! Damn it! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Two resolutions I've made : 1) I resolve to horn at all taxis that stop illegally along any roads. 2) I resolve not to give way to any taxis anymore!</div>
