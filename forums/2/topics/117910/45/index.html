There are also a group of pple who likes to make their cars drive better and also a group who likes to dress up their cars.

As a result of my car being kissed by someone while parked at Tangs (hit n run) I got a recommendation from a friend for a mechanic at Sin Ming Industrial Est. They do servicing as well and I'll be going there for my 20K service. They will only change what needs to be changed, hence it will be a whole lot cheaper than Nissan's. Although certain things are supposed to be changed as per the package for Nissan, noone really knows if they do as our cars are all quite new, so the parts are all OK. The guy's place is @ Block 12, Section B, unit 50 I think. It's the one right at the end, called Siong something. I usually communicate with the wife, Chris. Nice people. If you say you got a recommendation from a purple coloured March, they will definitely know it's me! (Coz I had to resend my poor Bubbles in just a day after her dent was knocked out and repainted after she got scratched while I was turning into my fiance's front porch!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

As a result of my car being kissed by someone while parked at Tangs (hit n run) I got a recommendation from a friend for a mechanic at Sin Ming Industrial Est. They do servicing as well and I'll be going there for my 20K service. They will only change what needs to be changed, hence it will be a whole lot cheaper than Nissan's. Although certain things are supposed to be changed as per the package for Nissan, noone really knows if they do as our cars are all quite new, so the parts are all OK. The guy's place is @ Block 12, Section B, unit 50 I think. It's the one right at the end, called Siong something. I usually communicate with the wife, Chris. Nice people. If you say you got a recommendation from a purple coloured March, they will definitely know it's me! (Coz I had to resend my poor Bubbles in just a day after her dent was knocked out and repainted after she got scratched while I was turning into my fiance's front porch!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Hey Sweet bubbles,<br><br>Is yr marchie purple?

I took up the preventive maintenance program which consist of 4 servicing at $806, an average of $200 plus per service. Took it up as i tot if anything wrong with the car it is still under warranty and can go back to them. If service outside these fellas might void it. So basically got a LL feeling. You can also try this place in Kaki Bukit that service Nissan cars. Called Autosaver. Some of the Marchies here swears by it. Can see the fellas service your car, learn from them, change parts only when needed blah blah blah. Call them at 68487328. hope this helps.</div>
