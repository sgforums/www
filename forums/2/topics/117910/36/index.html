I went for my 2nd servicing on a Sat morn (830am) and it was quite fast.  Went for breakfast and within 1.5hrs, my car was done.  I read somewhere in this thread (or forum) that doing in the afternoon could be a better idea because there are more staff servicing your car.  Maybe you want to check with Tan Chong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Also for the price, you can easily get a car with a bigger engine, boot and seating space.<br>But I doubt many of us chose the MArch because it was value for money, but rather its great features and unique looks.</div>

I did mine on a weekday at 7pm, so there was no waiting time. I think sat are normally fully booked cos most pple are not free on weekdays, so you'll prob have to wait about 2hrs before your car is ready. Anyway if you do decide to book on a sat you have to book 1 week in advance cos very popular.<br>Remember to remove all valuables frm the car before you give it to them, eg. cash card, opc parking coupons etc...</div>

Thats why its still 'rare' as compared to the Sunnys and Vios or Altis. These cars gives the space, 1.5l/1.6l engine size and reliability that many pple likes comparing to the March 1.4l. The time when i bought the car, the Sunny and Vios are priced lower (dunno abt today though) and to me they are more value for money. As for the Altis, it seems that traditionally, Toyota Corolla has been a good value car with good resale value. Dunno abt the market now as in the past Corollas are made in Japan. Anyway pple chose the cars for various reasons and each has their own priority in life. Just my 2 cents. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I am using 14" rims. Maybe diff size have diff requirement. And also if you ferry pple all the time, fuel consumption, blah blah blah. Better check with others here or maybe NYC can give you advise.
