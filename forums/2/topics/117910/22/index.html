For past meetups we have some pickups from MRT. Just need to inform us here and we can arrange for something. Then can longpang some of the members car after that.

No regrets as the car is performing really well...excellent handling for a small car, pick-up in 1st gear is slightly lacking but once you get to 2nd and 3rd gear she really shines, no problems with the displays, air con, electronics etc, which is to be expected for a Japanese car, fuel consumption is also as expected around 13-14km/litre...nothing to complain about really, except that I also heard the slight wind noise in the left back door whenever I go above 90km/h...have to check with the mechanic when I go for my first 1000km servicing.<br><br>I know I'm going to get kicked by some people for saying this, namely NYC_Micra haha...but for $58K this car is a steal man!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  A Japanese car for a Korean car price haha! I just found out that a friend of mine bought a Kia Rio 1.3L (A) for $51K, can you imagine that?
