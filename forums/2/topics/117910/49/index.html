            <div class='col-md body'>Hey tedz, sorry to hear abt ur espisode...<br>If the guy who knocks into u isnt holding a valid license, dont report him too cos similar to a drink-driver, u cant claim against his insurance as he couldnt even purchase a car, let alone the insurance policy. What we can do against these pple is to file a civil suit against them... but then a lot of considerations too, i guess...<br><br>Recently, my brother's car innocently kenna knocked too and the other party apologised once he came out of the car. Unfortuntely, my bro didnt have a camera to take pictures (was too dark to use hp camera) and they just exchanged particulars and make their own reports. To make things worst, this guy gave his statement in such a way that it became my brother's fault. So in this case where reports are totally contradicting, trouble brews cos u have to worry about doing own damage or 3rd party claim, repair at authorised, agents or whichever workshops willing to fight 3rd party claim for u, ncd and premium affected next year etc...<br><br>Me &amp; my bro spent a few days asking ard for expert advice and now finally he got his car done but the case not closed yet. Will share with u when we next meet or if u r having this headache at this time, feel free to call me and I'll tell u what the considerations are, especially when ur car is also new. My bro's car was only 5 days old when he got into the accident.<br><br>Learn a lot through this accident and realise the importantance to have a camera with u all the time... that time when i used my camera at sentosa outing was not becos it was an outing but more so becos i always carry a camera everywhere i go...<br><br></div>

I oso got to know this in early march only... but oso maybe becos i hv a friend who works in Tan Chong mgmt... who gave me a better deal... Is it possible to remove and sell the body kits now?
