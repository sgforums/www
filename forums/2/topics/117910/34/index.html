            <div class='col-md body'>BTW, read from somewhere, that NEVER to change back to mineral oil once you have used synthetic. this is cos the seals (or whatever) have already reacted to the new syn oil which has different properties. changing back will damage the seals. or something liddat.<br><br>juz fyi</div>
