              Exceeding More Than 61km/h = more than $200 Fine + 24 Demerit Points + Court.
              
              Driving Offences:
              Failing to Put On Seat Belt = $120 Fine + 3 Demerit points
              Crossing Double White Lines = $130 Fine + 4 Demerit Points

              You cannot hold your phone in your hand when you drive, even with loud speaker and/or ear piece

              For First Offence = Up to $5,000 Fine and/or Jail Term + License Suspended + Court
              For Second Offence = Jail Term + Fine + License Su spended + Court

              Court Cases:
              If you want to be a hero and fight the court case yourself, and you lose, you pay the court charges yourself, which will add to your fine.
              Court charges are at least $200 and above.
              
              Demerit Point System:
              Let's say you have 0 points on 1st January 2009, and you committed the offence of 'Failing to Put On Seat Belt'.
              So now, you will have 3 demerit points and this will last for one Year.
              If during this one year you have no demerit point offences at all, your 3 demerit points will be gone on 1/1/2010.
              But, if during this one year, from 1/1/2009 to 1/1/2010, you commit another offence with demerit points, your very first offence will be extended for another year until 1/1/2011.
