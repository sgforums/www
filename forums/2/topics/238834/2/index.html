I have to agree with what you said... Maybe i went a little overboard... because i just cant stand the amount of attention given to WRXs in Singapore...

Are you an owner of a WRX? hahaha... cool down man... I did not condemn the WRX wat... It is really cheap power... come on it's a fact... and the very fact that Subaru won awards for its engine is due to the fact that they can come up with a cheap yet fast engine...<br><br>Anyway i think you're being over defensive... Just look at your language... Now i know what kind of people actually admire the WRX... The image of WRX drivers or wannabes hasn't changed after all these years --&gt; Slightly well-to-do Ah Bengs</div></blockquote>I'm not an owner of WRX but I do wish to be a future drive of the WRX STI if I can. You did conemn the WRX, you already did. By saying it's cheap power, you are already condemning Subaru and other respective Japan car company like Mitsubishi, Toyota, Suzuki and so on. So I can say that Mitsubishi great performance on paper it's due to it's "Cheap Technology because of it's MIVEC turbo".<br><br>Of course they win the award based on the fact that they create a incredible engine but yet cheap at the same time. This is call supply and demand because this kind of cars are cater to those middle class citizens of each country. If not, everyone will be rich enough to buy a Ferrari/Lamborghini.<br><br>Sorry, I'm not a ah beng and based on my Language, you can tell that I'm a well to do person with a rather good English Language standard.<br><br>Last question of the day, "So driving a mercedes makes you a upper class/higher class citizen."<br><br>You can scrimp and save whole year just to afford a mercedes, and not living comfortably at the same of the day.<br><br>"So driving a Subaru WRX STI, Civic ESI, Civic SIR, makes you a ah beng."<br><br>Haha, wake up your idea. By condemning that Subaru is cheap power cause they are a certified proven and up to class company for its own classes.<br><br></div>
