At the end of it, its still a 2.0 4g63 mivec engine with turbo. Even if let you throw in a TD07 super big size turbo, you will need to find a better air flow system to compensate for that super huge turbo lag.<br><br>In the 300km/h range, the aerodynamic of a lambo is better to control than an evo. The stability is there.<br><br>Dun forget, at the end of the day evo is design as a street car unlike the lambo is a dragster on straight lines.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Hey, dont assume on based on what I said. I said keeping up and I didnt say outrun an Lamborghini. Don't just do quick reading, do a proper reading on what I said before you want to comment.<br><br>Le Mans, GT Class, WRC, F1. These races are already out of the boundary of what we are already discussing about. Those races are other type of classes of cars. We're talking about streets legal cars which aren't even included in those kind.<br><br>And I dont understand why people like to see top speed, could you even run that kind of speed on track? I think most pple will be more interested in the kind of speed it can do while turning what kind of lap times it could give on different tracks. Comparing a lamborghini to an evo on a straight drag race, it's simply like comparing pakistan to america in terms of their economic turn over.<br><br>14 Lamborghini Murcielago 1.23.7<br>21 Mitsubishi Evo FQ 400 1.24.8<br><br>Is 1 of a second that much matters of you? Let's look at the price difference, a lamborghini and evo costs how much. With that amount, you could jolly well spend your money on somewhere else you deem fit. Anyway, my point of view is that, Mitsubishi and Subaru had made such a almost perfect piece of engineering that comparing with continental cars, they are not very far behind. And come on, live life to true with what it is. Do you think you can afford a lamborghini in the coming future? Stop talking like you guys own 1 and pays for 1, please.<br><br>I agree with you mitgalant. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Does it degrade the brand or anything? No wat... it's just used for comparison... I am okay with Jap brands and the fact that you see so many Jap cars in Singapore is that they are affordable and reliable... But I really dont like it when people go over the limit and bring it over the sky... So I wanna say again --&gt; The WRX is a fast street car but it's not the best, definitely not as amazing as many Singaporeans portray it to be...<br><br>Dont forget that Citroen is the frequent winner for WRC races... not to forget about Ford...     </div></blockquote>i can bet with you that the FQ400 wont be able to keep up with the lambo round the nurburgring....nvm la...CSL is more than enough....give it 3 laps.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
