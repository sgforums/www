            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, i have a bad experience while buying the old car and decided to get a new one instead.<br><br>I arrived late in the evening and didnt really compared to the rest of the ohter used-car dealers in singapore with the intention of getting one. I wanted to save time and i have looked at the sgcarmart and most of their vechicles are sold and i thought they must be a reputable dealer.  They always write true price honest deal etc on their ads. (Then i have realised that i have to pay more actually if i were to really buy the old car)<br><br>The SE asked for my budget i said monthly 200++ can already.<br>and i selected a 1.6 car. I test drive the car and was really fond of the car.<br>when i asked about the engine oil and oil filter is ok? a i was too lazy to check, he briefly mentioned that dun worry coz they got free 6 mths workshop warranty.<br>After i have decided on the car, he had never mentioned to me about the insurance, the transfer fee, the road tax expiring in 2 weeks time(Its only i mentioned whether i can get the 6 mths road tax free and he propose that they pay half about $300 plus and i pay $300 plus and i agreed) and never mentioned whether i need a gurantor or not to approve the loan. When i ask if the loan is not approved how ah? His reply was dun worry sure approved.<br>I handed him the $500 deposit and only came to realise that the deposit is not refundable upon payment. When i asked whether the monthly repayment can be deducted from my giro, he said no problem but his customer always come every month to touch up their car!! (oh oh, car servicing, that's why)<br><br>The next morning, i called the dealer and check whether my loan was approved and they said they will get back to me. The next day, their clerk called and said that the loan was not approved and i need a gurantor. Then i dragged them in search of a gurantor but failed. One week later they called me and ask me to go down to their showroom instead and select a small car. But they only left with 2 smaller cars that i dun like. The boss also mentioned that they are doing business and can write what lawyer letter as i asked whether i can have the deposit back or not since i didnt get the car i want. (He also mentioned that he feel very pai sei not to return my deposit and i didnt get the small car also) Since then they never contacted me liao.<br><br>Anyway, i was too rash to signed the documents anyway and i didnt blame the dealer. I am willingly to let go my $500 deposit and go for a new car to take away the monthly service problem and resell value.<br><br>So if you want to buy a old car, be very caution<br>and also leave the option of getting a new car as well<br><br>See which one is better.<br>Of coz just top up a merely of $200 more for the new car.<br>At least we know that if the old car engine breaks down after a year ot 2, say bye bye to old car and still owe the bank $$ and for the old car, for new car we know that there is guranteed warranty and serviced by reputable workshop.<br><br>Of coz, buying an old car is that is reliable is difficult coz mostly are on the road now and many are those with frequent problems are left in the workshops. Anyway, be caution when buying an old car. I am not telling you not to buy if you have decided to buy one but choose carefully -make sure you visited all the dealers in singapore and get the best deal. have no regrets. Delay in the buying process and let the car price drop. Usually the dealer has a road tax renewal problem coz they also renew the car for 6 mths so they are forced to hard sell the car. Even if the car doesn't come with free 6 mths road tax, be sure to ask for one coz for old cars that aged 10 yrs or older there is a surcharge for the road tax and you must send the car to LTA for inspection every year. A typical 1.6litre car aged 15 yrs will have a yearly road tax of $1400++ every year and this translated to $$120++ on top of the montly car repayment if you were to break down the $1400 divided by 12 mths. Oh yes, dun forget about the insurance as well, the clerk told me it was $1700 third party one.<br><br>Therefore i breakdown the monthly repayment expenses of<br>Car repayment, insurance repayment and road tax repayment<br>Works up to $550 + every month!<br><br>What about getting a new 1.3L car instead??<br><br>So i really understand why the LTA is so much smart and we see new car on the singapore expressway and small roads everytime.<br><br>I finally understand with the $500 dollar lesson.<br><br>So folks when buying old car choose carefully!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

Coz cars that are 2 yrs old are re-export to other countries and if a car buyer in singapore want to buy new car, the loan for old car is 7 yrs and the interest rate is 4.75% compared to 3.5% 10 yrs loan. The monthly repayment would be lower or same as the old car one..<br><br>E.g.<br>Corolla Atlis registered in 2004(coe expires in 2014, 8 yrs time), sells at $40K<br>Interest rate at 4.75% per year for 7 yrs =1900 x 7 mth =13300<br>Bank repayment loan 7 yrs = 13300 + 40000 = 634.52 / mth<br>excludes road tax/insurance calculation here.<br><br>New Corolla Atlis 2006(coe ends at 2016) sells at $59K<br>Interest rate at 3.5% per year for 10 yrs = 2065 x 10 = 20650<br>Bank repayment loan 10 yrs = 20650 + 59000 = 663.75 / mth<br>excludes road tax/insurance calculation here.<br>25% interest rebate after car is registered for a mth= $5162.50 (Works out to $43.02 deduction from the bank repayment every month for 120 months!)<br>So in other words, 66375 - 43.02 = $620.73 LOWER than the OLD car<br><br>Of coz the breakeven for the old car is shorter in any case.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
