They don't have to fulfil your colour of wish because ultimate you have 3 months grace to register your car after you got the COE.  That's just an excuse for overlooking your transaction.<br><br>Take the money and place it with another PI.  I'm sure there are loads who have Open Cat in hand, and are wiling to give more discount / freebies than Pinnacle. At least by publishing here, you have given poor publicity to Pinnacle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To the thread starter, u may have to bring this matter to court.<br><br>Doubt CASE can help you. Because for CASE to help u, ur purchase got to be under the HP Act. To Qualify for the HP Act ur car price has to be less then 55k after minusing COE. For your case: 68K - 9K or 12K is still above 55k thus u will be under the Common Law and not HP Act.<br><br>But i guess u may still seek CASE's advice as a consumer and that the promise is not fulfilled hopefully they can help</div>
