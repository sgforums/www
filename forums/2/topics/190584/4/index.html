More importantly, since you now claim that all along your remarks have been directed at the consequences of speeding in general, then doesn't my very first reply already hit your so-called stand on the head? (If there even is one behind that statement)<br><br><blockquote>Now tell me<br>If my loves one need $ for an operation and i got no $...<br>U mean i can rob a bank and claim that the $ is to pay for my love one operations?<br>Wuld this justify my cause?<br><br>Even if hes love one were in their final hrs,so what?<br>I believe if he really cared for them,even if he culdnt make it on time,they wuld have know that he was a caring person<br>from what he has done to them in his daily life..<br><br>Theres no reason to use selfishness to justify ur act<br><br>and suppsoe the person had knock down into a pedestrain of other motorist,whos gonan make up for the victim cause?<br><br>THINK AGAIN!<br>U still got alot to grow in terms of ur mind!</blockquote>3. Following that, you say that I, as well as the driver, are using "selfishness to justify ur(our) acts". Also, trying to tell me to grow up? Oh, come on, who's<br>being discourteous now? Bear in mind, I'm not picking on that. I'm just highlighting your ostentatious display of obnoxious obstinance.<br><br><blockquote>Aiya KNN LA FLAMERS<br><br>LEt me make myself clear OK<br>IF U UNDERSTAND ENGLISH<br><br>The whole post wasnt meant to b direct at the drivver<br><br>but more of speeding<br><br>My point:if a person sped,he shldnt b pitied<br>reason why?hes endangering other<br>U can feel pity for all i care but this is my opinion<br><br>Second:no matetr what reason he got,one is not entilted to speed!<br><br><span style="color: red;">And for fake sake,if juz bcuz i used the word"driver" instead of "he" (No.4a)</span><br>and it makes u guys tink i'm pinpoitn at driver,den pity u who allow words cloud ur judgement<br><br>simple and cleaar<br><span style="color: red;">nothing associated with driver (No.4b) </span><br>SATISFIED?<br><br>U flamers use ur heart to judge the pitiful state of a person who died while speeding[person as in not that rx driver,but of an anyone who sped]<br>and then using his plight to justify his cause<br><br>I on the other hand use my mind and seperate logic and sympathy for the drivers<br><br>Thats y the reason calling u lowlife</blockquote>4a. I refer you to your very post once again. If you have problems, do try to click "View", "Text Size", select "Largest". Or visit your nearest neurologist. The optician can't help.<br><br>4b. Once again, refer to your very first post. Don't think we are effing morons to believe your ridiculous claim that you were not referring to him. If you were not, then WTF are you doing spurting verbal diarrhoea in this thread?<br><br>Lastly, I challenge you to answer my questions on page 2, posted on May 15th at 1.30am. I am not here to fight for nothing. But I won't stand down after seeing a little sh1tbag leak a deluge of dungspeak about how the deceased deserved it. I maintain that you owe the victim's family an apology, as well as anyone who sympathizes with their family and friends.<br><br>PS: You can't send your condolences to someone deceased, assho1e (I'm not calling you that. I'm just addressing the source I'm assuming all this sh1t is spurting out from).</div>

Too much in fact.<br><br>Heng, actually, there is no hint of any apology from him. I want to see a proper apology from him now, addressing all who are concerned.<br><br><blockquote>My advice is that U should admit that at the start, yes u did aim at the driver, but after a<br>certain number of behest to respect the dead, u've changed tack to the issue of speeding it<br>self,<br>and apologise for having directed any sort of judgement at the driver to begin with. </blockquote><blockquote>in the initial yes,cuz after viewing some forumlites has post,i tho the driver was<br>speeding<br>some mentioned he has to rush to meet cus<br>so i took his view<br><br>after which,to incus lesser misudnerstanding,i played safe and shifted to speeding<br><br>u mentioned i've alread apologise,well by some ppl dun read the above thread<br>bob bian<br>what the fuk can i do</blockquote>1. To incur lesser blows to your stupid remarks, as well as your personality (if that can<br>even be counted), you shifted your stance, NOT to incur lesser misunderstanding. Either you<br>are stupid to have posted it in a manner welcoming an offence, or you don't know what you're<br>talking about. I am not as stupid as to have misunderstood your comments.<br><br>2. The abovementioned thread in question, which supposedly contains your apology, does not<br>exist, if you cannot see.<br><br>3. <blockquote>and worst of all...its some final request from customer at workshop<br>to kron<br>so u think its ok to speed?<br>Next time,tell the tp that ur speeding so as to meet cus<br><br>DARE?<br>Until so,DUN TALK COK! </blockquote>Do I need to point out to you again what you have said before? Stop trying to LIE your way through this. The only place it's going to get you is into more trouble. This was your response waaaay after you had initially wrongfully accused him of speeding. Besides, there is still no proof, at the time of your posting, that he was speeding.<br><br>4. What the fuk can you do? Apologise PROPERLY to anyone whom you have shown the slightest<br>inkling of disrespect to, in particular to his family members and friends.<br><br><blockquote>U flamers use ur heart to judge the pitiful state of a person who died while speeding[person as in not that rx driver,but of an anyone who sped]<br>and then using his plight to justify his cause </blockquote>5. Do show us where these "flamers" have done such a thing. I want to see. If not, you'd better retract your statement and apologise again.<br><br><blockquote>stop ur bullshyt,<span style="color: red;">What i'm talking all along is about his actions</span><br>I'merly pinpointing that his actions were wrong if he have sped<br><br>Have u seen me insulting or flaming him or his family?<br>what i've posted is not about the driver in whole but of the consequence<br>of speeding[suppose he did] </blockquote>6. Once again, you want to bullsh1t your way through. First, you say that all along you were talking about his actions. Then, you claim here "The whole post wasnt meant to b direct at the drivver". WTF are you trying to say? You brain's not functioning well? Or is it even present? Are you suffering from multiple personality disorder?<br><br><blockquote>Aiya KNN LA FLAMERS<br><br>LEt me make myself clear OK<br>IF U UNDERSTAND ENGLISH<br><br><span style="color: red;">The whole post wasnt meant to b direct at the drivver</span></blockquote><br><br><blockquote>And for fake sake,if juz bcuz i used the word"driver" instead of "he"<br>and it makes u guys tink i'm pinpoitn at driver,den pity u who allow words cloud ur judgement<br><br>simple and cleaar<br>nothing associated with driver<br>SATISFIED? </blockquote>7. You make a rollercoaster look like a wading pool. In this case, we'll have to wade through<br>your bullsh1t. Here you claim "nothing associated with driver". Who will believe you? Yes,<br>your bullsh1t will.<br><br><blockquote>ok...then thats really good<br>Yes,feel sad that life have been lost and family have to pick the pieces<br><br>But note that the previous post are about speeding and nt directly posted about the driver..<br>thanks alot<br><br>Deepest condolence to the family</blockquote>8. If this is about as close as you can get to providing an apology, I suggest you'd better<br>try much harder.<br><br>If you are still man enough to uphold your claim of having made an apology, then post another one to make it clear for everyone what your stand is and where you have been wrong.<br><br>Here is an example:<br><br>I, Takumi Fujiwara Wannabe, do solemnly, and most sincerely, apologise to all involved parties, especially to the family members and friends of the deceased, for having made wrongful accusatory insults and remarks to the victim, as well as to those I have irresponsibly labelled as "flamers".<br><br>I hereby wish to retract all my unwarranted and mischievous statements regarding all involved parties, and do declare them as false and misleading.<br><br>THIS IS WHAT YOUR APOLOGY SHOULD LOOK LIKE.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Read the post on the 1st page<br>I alread said that IF the driver was speeding,than i dun think any form of sympathy shld b given<br>And its not juz directed at that particular driver who crash<br>it applies to any driver </blockquote>1. This obviously does not coincide with your poorly misinformed judgement that he was speeding. If you haven't learnt the differences yet, let me show you. Saying that "IF the driver was speeding" and "well the way the driver was driving,i'm pretty sure he was speeding" are two unmistakably different statements. First, you said you are pretty sure, given the way he was driving. God knows how you saw it, or learnt about it. Then, you contradict it to claim that you said "IF the driver was speeding". I would have an easier time conversing with apes in Sanskrit. Edgar Davids made it clear by adding "if he was speeding". You said you were pretty sure.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><blockquote>well the way the driver was driving,i'm pretty sure he was speeding,correct me if im wrong</blockquote></span><br><br><blockquote>Norx too read the article and claim that the driver was rushing to the workshop and driving faster than usual<br><br>hence the happening of the accident<br><br>That is why,initially,<span style="color: red;">I claim that the guy was speeding base on what the others<br>have read about the article </span></blockquote><br><br>2. nOx did not claim anything. Don't put things in other people's mouths again. He said "the article in the link above says tt the guy was rushing back to his workshop cos his customer got some last min request..", which is quite distinctly different from him claiming anything at all. "prob tt constitutes to him driving faster than usual" is a suggestion of possibility that he MIGHT have sped, vastly contrasting to your claim that you are pretty sure he was speeding, based on whatever witness accounts you might claim to have.<br><br>3. Based on what others have read about the article, the only comment which surfaced cited the report that it was raining and he crashed. <span style="color: red;">I want you to justify how you managed to conclude that he was speeding, based on that one and only reference to the contents of the article.</span><br><br><blockquote>its not that the rx-7 speed... its just that the wheel nut came of,<br>tyre den came of, rear axle came of, differential came of and the car<br>vanished. case closed. And also my condolences </blockquote>4. SBS9828X said that of the accident. Whether or not is true, I have no idea. I am not trying to say that he is spouting rubbish either. What I am saying is, since you have claimed to base your comments on the speculations from other forummers, how and why did you fail to pick up this crucial piece of  information, given your admittedly great propensity to poorly expound on such speculatory comments?<br><br><blockquote>if he sped i wun feel sorry<br><span style="color: red;">if he werent speeding,i'll have given my condolence </span></blockquote><br><br><blockquote>well the way the driver was driving,i'm pretty sure he was speeding,correct me if<br>im wrong<br><br>If one speed,den he shld not b pitied,If fact hes already a nusciance on the road..<br>If i were to race on the road,I'll have the preparation that if i die racing,I expect<br>no condolence bcuz what i do i do is purely risky...no need for condolence </blockquote><span style="color: red;">5. Most importantly, LOOK HERE. You want me to deconstruct your statement? I'll do just that.<br>Firstly, by mentioning that judging from the way the driver was driving, and then proceeding to allege that he was quite definitely speeding, you have, whether unintentionally or not, implicated the aforementioned driver of the RX-7. By doing so, without shifting your focus of the person in mention, all your following statements will be quite reasonably regarded as in reference to the victim.<br><br>Continuing on with your speculation that he had been speeding, you pressed on to call him a "nusciance" ( "nuisance" ). Furthermore, you introduced the idea of racing, which was clearly never brought up by anyone but you, despite your admittance of making comments based on what the other readers "have read". This, obviously, was only surfaced by yourself and is a clear indication that you have attempted to draw a connection between speeding and racing as the cause of the accident.<br><br>Ending that, you declared that there is "no need for condolence" if you died racing. It is, quite explicitly shown, that you had concluded he was racing and therefore need no condolence.<br><br>Two days after that, on page 3, you finally declare your "deepest condolence" to his family, and now even try to uphold your despicable show of righteousness by claiming to have apologised, while it is evidently absent. Such an act, as to express one's condolences, is clearly incongruent in comparison to one who is truly sympathetic with the victim's family and friends. It is disgusting and abusive, and most definitely not one of an easily<br>forgettable action.</span><br><br>Quote from page 3:<br><blockquote>ok...then thats really good<br>Yes,feel sad that life have been lost and family have to pick the pieces<br><br>But note that the previous post are about speeding and nt directly posted about the driver..<br>thanks alot<br><br>Deepest condolence to the family</blockquote><blockquote>To add<br>after hearing what his aquaintance had said<br>I've already apologise since he mentioned the driver wasnt speeding </blockquote>Now, again, you dare to perverse the facts which have been openly shown and claim that you have already apologised, when it is clearly lacking?<br><br>There is really no hope for you. Let me make it clear. Even exceeding the speed limit by 1kmh is already considered speeding by law. Are you going to withdraw any sense of sympathy if the circumstances were so? You apologise now or I will continue to make you face your own embarrassing bullsh1t.<br><br>Refer to the example of the apology above. I expect no less.</div>
