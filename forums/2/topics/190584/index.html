There is no substantial reason for you to justify your selfish kind of logic. Do you honestly think that most people out there would cruise along the roads normally if their one of their family or friends were in the hospital, in danger of losing their lives? Would you? I'd like to see you try.</span><br><br><blockquote><strong>THINK AGAIN!<br>U still got alot to grow in terms of ur mind!</strong></blockquote><span style="color: red;">Use your head again please. Emergencies aren't called emergencies for nothing. That's why ambulances and firetrucks have to drive faster to get to an urgent situation earlier. Time is of the essence. If you drive slowly, keep to the left then. Not everyone drives like you, don't be selfish.</span></div>

I'm not a fool and it's obvious enough, if one were to use a minimal part of his brains, that not everything the press states is true and factual.<br><br>On the other hand, if he were speeding/driving recklessly to handle a client, I wouldn't call it of significant reason for him to have done so either.<br><br>You claim you know that it is natural for people to rush to the aid of their loved ones. So why on earth did you even dismiss it with a "so what" and even call it a selfish act?<br><br>Going by your logic that you can't be 100% sure and there'll always be a risk, I don't suppose you ferry anyone in your car at all, do you? Considering the fact that anyone could hit your car any time too? Better be safe than sorry, isn't it?<br><br>The other thing is, just because he drove an RX7, you think he is dangerous, reckless and inept to handle the car well. What makes you think that the average driver can handle their Sunnys or Corollas anywhere near his level? And just because an ambulance driver has had training, he can speed safely? Without endangering others as well? Did you train them? How did you come to the conclusion that an ambulance driver is better at this guy at controlling their vehicle? End of the day, it doesn't mean that the ambulance is immune to danger either.<br><br>I do agree that a constant show of care and concern for your loved ones is more of an "appropriate" behaviour, but that doesn't mean you can't care for people whom you don't normally show it to.<br><br>Now, the argument is this: Whether one would have the right to speed during a critical situation or not. We both agree that having to meet his clients demands is not a reasonable explanation for him to have done so. What you need to understand, is that others will still speed in attempt to make up for time, whether to get to work on time, or spending the final moments with their loved ones.</div>
