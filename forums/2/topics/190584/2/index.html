Fellow Singaporean dies and all Singaporeans do is put in their 2 cents on HOW he died and if he deserved it, fight verbally with each other trying to correct each other and there's barely any condolences written on this forum. It's so sad.<br><br>Is this how Singaporeans react towards an accident?<br><br>God bless his soul and may he rest in peace. May the passing of the family's loved one be smooth and he be remembered for all his good deeds.<br></div>

I'm not a fool and it's obvious enough, if one were to use a minimal part of his brains, that not everything the press states is true and factual.<br><br>On the other hand, if he were speeding/driving recklessly to handle a client, I wouldn't call it of significant reason for him to have done so either.<br><br><span style="color: red;">You claim you know that it is natural for people to rush to the aid of their loved ones</span>. So why on earth did you even dismiss it with a "so what" and even call it a selfish act?<br><br>Going by your logic that you can't be 100% sure and there'll always be a risk, I don't suppose you ferry anyone in your car at all, do you? Considering the fact that anyone could hit your car any time too? Better be safe than sorry, isn't it?<br><br><span style="color: red;">The other thing is, just because he drove an RX7, you think he is dangerous, reckless and inept to handle the car well</span>. [/color]What makes you think that the average driver can handle their Sunnys or Corollas anywhere near his level? And just because an ambulance driver has had training, he can speed safely? Without endangering others as well? Did you train them? How did you come to the conclusion that an ambulance driver is better at this guy at controlling their vehicle? End of the day, it doesn't mean that the ambulance is immune to danger either.<br><br>I do agree that a constant show of care and concern for your loved ones is more of an "appropriate" behaviour, but that doesn't mean you can't care for people whom you don't normally show it to.<br><br>Now, the argument is this: Whether one would have the right to speed during a critical situation or not. We both agree that having to meet his clients demands is not a reasonable explanation for him to have done so. What you need to understand, is that others will still speed in attempt to make up for time, whether to get to work on time, or spending the final moments with their loved ones.</div></blockquote>Yes..i did mentioned that rushing to love one is natural..but still theres really no reason to speed..<br>moreever,its on a wetday...theres no knowing if u might slip the wheel or anything<br>secondly..i mentioned that abulance too speed...yes,they r given training...<br>althought that dosent means that they r immune to accident,however,they are better adapt at th kinda situiation and will have an easy trafic e as cars will naturally give way to them<br><br>also...i dun mean that his rx-7 is a recklessc ar but what i meant is that,considering a sports car,acceleration is higher and wuld b much deficult to slow down if theres a urgent need too..</div>

How on earth do you suppose anyone can rush without speeding? Can you show me? I've<br>already stated clearly, if you cannot read properly, that in an emergency, time is critical.<br>Time = Distance / Speed. Simple logic. Understand?<br><br>4. You still have not explained where you derived your idea that all ambulance drivers<br>are given training, in whatever form it is, and how it therefore equips them with better skills to handle a difficult<br>situation. And you are assuming, once again, that they have a nice open road for them as<br>the cars will naturally give way. I've seen idiots who don't, maybe because they have no<br>mental concept of what an emergency is and what it requires.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>NOTE THIS:what was his drivign?an rx-7,its fast and will he b able to control<br>the car?</strong></div></blockquote>5. Do you think that your average car can outbrake an RX-7? Unless your idea of what sports<br>cars are is similar to your style of thinking, it can't possibly happen. Just because an<br>RX-7 is a fast car, it doesn't mean it had had to be speeding.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>i too feel sorry about him but thats what the whole story said isnt it?<br>he speed,and now what happen..</blockquote></div>6. Let me remind you of your first statement. "If one speed,den he shld not b pitied,If<br>fact hes already a nusciance on the road.. " What kind of daft monkeys do you think we are to blindly forget that outrageous allegation of yours?<br><br><strong>[quote]well i too duno what really happen<br>BUT WHAT I'VE SAID ALONG ARE BASE ON WHAT THREAD STARTER HAS POST<br><br>SO STFU!</strong>7. Yea, I agree on what you've said. If one doesn't know what really happened, STFU.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Lastly, please allow me to make myself clear. I am truly saddened by this mishap, and I<br>regret that I have to be part of this sh1tfight. I will not, however, stand down after<br>seeing such a effing stupid and irresponsible remark made without any respect, especially<br>to the one in passing.
