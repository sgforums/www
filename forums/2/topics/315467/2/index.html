              say roads i am talking about paved roads in singapore which you are
              asking about in the first place.</p>
              <p>Like stella said earlier, if so many other drivers can drive
              safely why cant the rest? The ones who got thru safely were
              lucky?</p>
              <p>Absurd! haha.</p>

              <p>on the topic of road accidents, yeah sure human factors (drivers/speed etc) and mechanical (vehicles) factors play a big part, but to say roads and traffic design/engineering are things you should not question and consider is a sweeping statement lah. </p>

              <p>Heh, open to all kinds of discussion lah. Public forum mah. Though simple responses akin to the south buona vista road, old tampines road
              (that i know liao) and upper thompson area as mentioned by some others
              are more or less what I'm looking for</p>
              <p>If you believe road accidents are only caused by human and mechanical errors, then bo bian up to you lah. Everyone has different opinion mah. If you think road designs, surface, wet and dry conditions don't require consideration, then nevermind lah.</p>
              <p>I listed the nicoll highway as an example of how transport engineering can play an inconspicuous role in accidents as well.</p>
