But u might wanna consider toning down the sarcasm. I noe u have oredi apologised for the goading and the sarcastic remarks, but next time, try not to let it get to the point when u think u might needa apologise after some thought.<br><br>olala : u mentioned that u would reject a free car if u didnt like the type of car given to u. now think, if u gave someone something, and that person rejects it becoz he/she dun like the type of whatever u were giving and prefer another, more expensive type. how would u feel? A car is expensive to buy and even more expensive to maintain in sg. Maybe u should be more appreciative of things, whether or not they r given or bought, whether they r of the sort u like or not. I would think that u just need more time to grow up ( ur after all oni 17 ) , more exposure to the working world and much more tact, and you would be just fine. Less obstinacy and stubborn-ness and more open-ness to things new and an ability to accept that u r not always right, will stand u in good stead in the future.<br><br>This talk of fighting is not gonna go on here, or in any other thread alright? It ends here. Let the peace and fun-ness of this forum return.</div>
