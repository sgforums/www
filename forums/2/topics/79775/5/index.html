            <div class='col-md body'>ST 5 Aug 2004<br><br>'GERMAN CARS MOST UNRELIABLE'<br><br>LONDON - German cars are among the most likely to develop faults or break down, while Japanese and Korean makes are the most reliable, according to a survey of British motorists to be published today.<br><br>Audi, BMW and Volkswagen were all rated poor for reliability in the study by the Consumers' Association. Least reliable car for the second year running was Audi's sporty TT model, which costs up to Â£32,000 (S$100,000). Out of 43 owners with a TT up to two years old, 21 per cent reported that their car had broken down in the past 12 months.<br><br>Next least-reliable was the E-Class from Mercedes Benz, with 16 per cent of the 44 examples in the survey needing attention in the past year.<br><br>Among the most reliable cars was Hyundai's Getz, which costs from as little as Â£7,000; MG's ZT and ZT-T; <span style="color: blue;">Mazda's 323</span> and Toyota's Corolla and Corolla Verso models. Close behind, with 99 per cent reliability, were the Honda Civic, the CR-V and Jazz, as well as the <span style="color: darkblue;">Mazda 6</span>, Peugeot 406 and 406 Coupe. -- AP<br></div>

I have never seen a red MZ6 on the road.  See whether you can post a picture?  BTW, did you try MZ6 2.3liter?  It is around 15k more expensive than the 2.0liter version.

GOOD buy.. !!!<br><br>RX8 is superb.. woah.. never tot that i will get the chance to drive it.. everything inside is auto ... high tech man.. the engine is woah... unbelievable the pick up and cornering ... very silent in driving.. this car can fly man... TAX is cheap for this sport car compare to others as it's considered 4 dr and 1.3 CC car.. although for its rotary engine.<br><br>i gtg for wedding dinner in my red sporty M6 liao.. bye!!! enjoy yr new Mazda!!!<br>MAZDA all the way!!!</div></blockquote>before you start and after you off the engine the car will lit up by itself for you to take yr things.. and the mirror comes with light shone on yr face. the engine is great..  &lt;-----wad tis mean ????????can explain ...thanks</div>

The mirror with the light.  So it makes you easier to mark during driving.  The mirror is behind the shield board.  But I don't understand the 1st one.  Does it means that the cabin light will be on even before you open the door?</div>

The que for the shipment will be going on for some time.  I think Mazda is expending their production capability.  Hence, the wait for shipment should be shorter and shorter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, i think all of us know that 5~6months waiting is standard. Even if they themself advertise something like that too... the wait is over...I think they should write "the wait is worth.."<br><br>BUT I REALLY BUAY TAHAN LIAO <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why have to wait cos you have to order MZ3 as it's quite new. in singapore they only kept Mz6 and the old models. Furthermore if you wan leather seat and addtional things they have to customise it. and all this is done overseas as the stock is overseas. I wana buy Mz3 one but cos have to wait so long then changed to Mz6.<br><br>about the light thingy.. youhave to try the car then you will know .. a lot more convenient to find things. something very nice about the interior.. the in build sound system for Mz6 is cool.. i can even feel my seat vibrate<br><br></div>
