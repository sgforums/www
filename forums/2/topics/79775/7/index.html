Used to be double wishbone all-round, now I think only rear has double wishbones. At one point they used electric steering in latest civic -- the steering feel was rubbery &amp; awful. The ride of latest civic also not as good as before.<br><br>Talking about gear box, many cars above 100k also ony 4-speed auto. When BMW 318i E46 model first appeared -- it only comes with 4-speed auto -- of course 5-speed better but 4-speed does the job too.<br><br>Also note that Mz3 auto gear box comes with "tiptronic" feature, allowing you to switch to manual selection -- this feature is not even available in many of the Jap 2 litre cars.<br><br>Mazda does have the technology, perhaps not the best in market but more than enough to meet our driving needs, e.g. Mz3 sold in Australia/USA come with 6 airbags, DSC etc. Unfortunately tech not fully deployed in models imported into Singapore as our high import tax would inflate the cost out of proportion.</div>

I have also test driven the Sedan version, stopping power is pretty good already. Unless you are an enthusiastic driver, you won't be needing rear discs brakes. However, rear disc brakes also can be quite tedious, they will generate additional brake dusts (I read somewhere thet the MZ3 rear disc brakes wears out more easily), have to do extra cleaning and replacing them when they are worn. The rear brake discs are there for that extra stopping power, if it is just for show (prevent eye sore ;P), then there's no reason to have them.<br><br>As for the 5-speed gear box, I have to agree with you, but most of the cars do not have them in terms of economical reasons (can cut cost why not?). But like I mentioned, I admired the ultra smooth shifting, even when you put your foot down</div>

It may be the local 'National' car, but the Thai built quality make it even worse, worse than the previous Japan made one. To start with, the Corolla / Altis (previous and this generation), derived from the Ipsum / Picnic MPV platform (to save cost), that what makes it to inherit the high roof-line wierd shape (causing too much body roll and the soft suspension make it worse), uncomfortable upright driving position, etc... Many people thinks that soft suspension contrbutes to ride comfort, but the fact is that it will make the ride bouncy and floaty, and that is definitely not ride comfort</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now the question overprice.<br><br>Due to the fact that M3 is still very new and high in demand, I think the factory still unable to produce enough M3 that is why Mazda Singapore charge a huge premium over the existing orders.<br><br>M3 (sedan)'s OMV is between 16 to 17k (based on MTA's figures) which is similar to Toyota's Altis. Howver the prices difference is so much.<br><br>M3 sedan (basic) : $78k (cost price: $66.27k [OMV:17km COE: 27k] profit: 11.73k)<br>Atis  : $71k (profit: 5.9k)<br><br>You see the different of about 6k. Well IMO, the price will drop after the next few shippement and all Mazda factories started to produce in full capacity.<br><br>The scenerio is very similar to MZ6 when it was 1st launched.<br><br></div>

If we can 'tong' long enough, then we should wait for the price to drop.<br><br>When I ask the sales guy, he always say "now mazda not like last time, we don't adjust price so much. It will never drop in future." What kind of marketing is this ?</div>
