COE dropping drastically soon.. many ppl said that.. due to higher quota on COE.. sad sad!!<br><br>we waited so long for M3 to see prices drop drastically, will be a disaster!</div></blockquote>Hi sportsfan,<br><br>Ya COE prices will continue to drop due to increase in quotas amongst all categories in cars, LTA didnt anticipate the higher amount of cars being scrapped. They gave a figure of 60,000 cars to be scrapped by 3rd quarter and it seems there have been 70,000 scrapped. Therefore they have raised the quotas of each cat by approx 22-23%. (til next yr march)<br><br>For sure this will be the best time to purchase a new car, am sorry that you fall in the category where your wait falls in till end of the year, having paid at a higher price. Most of the car prices have been slashed, m2 went down to 68988. About 2 weeks ago, it was at a high of 71.8k. Drop of 3k.<br><br>Think of it on the bright side, M3 is worth the wait and your queue time will be so much shorter than those who will be booking it now. I am sure, they wil have till next yr to get the car. Seriously long wait!<br><br>I have recently joined the Mazda Club Singapore, hope to see you there during the next meet-up.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br></div>
