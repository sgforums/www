Compared with the focus, it may not be able to keep up, in terms of 0-60 times, but the engine note sure sounds more sporty and enthusiastic; the Yamaha tuned Zetec SE engine of the Focus is too smooth for my liking (funny, cos that the Auto Version sounds better), so as in the over light clutch pedal and shift, not much robust feel. As the Focus looks became dated gracefully (it's still a great car to own nonetheless, since it was launched first back in 199<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, the M3 oozes much more styles, inside and outside.<br><br>The M3 has the same or better handling capability as the current Focus, since it's adopting the new 2nd generation Focus C1 Platform, whch will be in the New Focus (launching end of this year), as well as in the new Volvo S40 and V50. However, the Suspension settings are done in Mazda's Hiroshima Testing Facility by Japanese Engineers, nothing wrong with that, I threw it into a third gear bend, and does not even understeers (just like the Focus), so not really necessarily that we need to have AWD as in the Impreza. High speed stabilty is another strong point for this car, as it obsorbs most of the bumps that we found on our roads. I tried doing hard braking on both the sedan and the hatch, and found that the hatch, with it's Front and Rear Disc Brakes really provides excellent stopping, it's not to say that the Sedan brakes will not that good, just that the hatch is better.<br><br>I was quite amazed by the just nice level of insulation of this car, not too quiet as the Peugeot 307 (can doze off while driving), and not as noisy as the Koreans, Altis (no offence).<br><br>Anyway, I have done a review of the M3 when it was launched here previously and it goes like this: ( no offence to anyone here, but just my own opinion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>Mazda Axela as called in Japan, 1.5VVT with 115ps.<br>Mazda3 as called in Singapore (and the rest of the<br>countries, including Europe and US), 1.6VVT with 105ps<br>(euro4 emission type)<br><br>Other versions include 2.0 &amp; 2.3 versions, which is<br>not available here of course.

I am a new comer.  Hopefully before Chrismas, I will join your M club with a red M3 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I am not very much agree with the comments that M3 are overpriced.  It's kind of unfair to directly compare the price between Japan made car and Asian country made car.  If compared with Honda civic and Subaru, I think M3 has the same price range.  In Singapore the overall cost to own a car is much higher than the car cost itself.  10k more in car price if distribute to 7 or 10 years loan, is about $100 dollars per month.  It is only about 10% or less of your overall spending.  If the car can make you feel happier and safer when you seat inside every day, why not dig your pocket a bit deeper?  In our world, good stuff never cost cheap, isn't it?<br><br>There are really not much discussion on the M3/6 RX-8 in this forum.  Is it because they are new or less owner, or the owners are all too busy in testing new cars and no time write in the board?<br><br>I was convinced that M3 is a safer car with the new platform, comparing with its Japanese peers.  It is a major sell point.  Anybody can comment on it?<br><br></div></blockquote>I have to agree with you on this one, and hey, I am getting a red one by the end of this year too! will yours be the sedan or the hatch? mine will a hatch.<br><br>btw, I have test driven the car with my friend recently, and I have to say It's one of the better cars I have driven, at least imo...<br><br>I used to look forward to owns a Ford Focus manual hatch, but after test driven it again last week, I was even more convinced that the M3 is a better bet. Compared with the focus, it may not be able to keep up, in terms of 0-60 times, but the engine note sure sounds more sporty and enthusiastic; the Yamaha tuned Zetec SE engine of the Focus is too smooth for my liking (funny, cos that the Auto Version sounds better), so as in the over light clutch pedal and shift, not much robust feel. As the Focus looks became dated gracefully (it's still a great car to own nonetheless, since it was launched first back in 199, the M3 oozes much more styles, inside and outside.<br><br>The M3 has the same or better handling capability as the current Focus, since it's adopting the new 2nd generation Focus C1 Platform, whch will be in the New Focus (launching end of this year), as well as in the new Volvo S40 and V50.

With the rear seats down, it offers even more space, like a mini wagon. Thats why in europe, most of the compact cars on the road are hatches, the angmos knows better what they want in a car. Sedans are restricted by the low chassis area towards the rear, aka the trunk area; and the rear windscreen further obstructs useful storage space. Also, hatches are easier to park (easier to gauge with the rear drop-down windscreen, no protusion of the trunks, as in the sedan). Go for a picnic, open the rear boot og the hatch and voila! instant shaded seat for two or more... the list goes on...    </strong></div>

My relative got his mazda 323 serviced by external shops and ended up with lots of problem. After switching back to authorised Mazda service center, there is less problem. There is a new Mazda service center in the west, just look for Autobacs.</div>
