Anyway, the SA Production Versions should be for the Middle East and maybe the European Markets. Ours should still be assembled in Japan, until Mazda decides to mass produce it in the Philipines (There's a Ford Plant there producing the Ugly Ford Laser currently) or even Thailand.<br><br>But I don't think so, at least not so soon. Mazda is still a smallish Automobile Company in Japan, and they are now recuperating their losses from their dark ages in the late 90s...<br><br>(Cars like the previous 323 before the MZ3 is produced during that time, and not much financial support for their R&amp;D Department. It's only when Ford sees the potential in them, and buy over 33% of the shares, and starts injecting funds, thats why they are now making a comeback, aka "back with a vengence", and they are giving us their best efforts yet, the MZ3, MZ6, MX-5, and of course the lengendary RX-8! To think, it's only a 1.3 liter rotary engine and sips petrol lesser than a typical 1.6, but still offers great performances! The RX-7 Turbo is being resurrected now, under full development, and will be available next year!)...<br><br>Moreover the MZ3 is their pride and joy, and strong selling point of still being produced in Japan itself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Amongst the 1.6 litre cars, Mazda 3 is in many ways better. I like the "European" feel when driving the car -- i.e. nice weighted/communicative steering &amp; well-damped suspension tuned for driving.<br><br>I also rate the interior highly -- factory-fitted stereo looks nice &amp; neat, unlike those locally fitted ones.<br><br>I booked the Luxury model -- twin SRS, auto air-con &amp; leather-wrapped steering &amp; gear knob are advantages over other models.

What color you choosed?<br>The sports model come with 4 disc brake.  I think they try to use this to distinguish the sports model and family models.  Besides the brake, I think the sports version has a more muscular sense in front view.</div>

The red exterior goes well with the beige interior -- that's why brochure shows red sedan. Saw one in red the other day, noticed that the red exterior blends well with the red rear lights. As for myself, chosen sparkling silver as we wanted a lighter shade.<br><br>I still think Mazda Singapore should import sedans with rear disc brakes. And please don't skimp on safety like 2nd air bag. Other countries get as many as 6 air bags (2 front, 2 side, 2 curtain) + high tech stuff like DSC for their Mz3s, sunroof, ...<br><br>Another thing that Mazda Singapore should consider is to expand their base --it is time they set up a new showroom cum workshop in the Alexandra area.</div>
