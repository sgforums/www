              <p>Whilst we're on the subject .. time for me to have a rant. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I ordered some takeaway from a restaurant in Little India last night &amp; went to pick it up. I parked in what I thought was a legitimate parking spot, but when I returned 5 minutes later I had received a $50 parking ticket. When I checked the signage I realised that it was a normal parking space except on Sunday's where it was reserved for buses &amp; trucks only. Ok fair cop I inadvertently parked illegally and was ticketed as a result. I can live with that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What REALLY annoyed me though was (1) parked 20m behind me on double yellow lines was a cement mixer truck which had not been ticketed (2) parked directly opposite me on double yellow lines was a Mitsubishi Lancer &amp; Honda Accord, neither of which had been ticketed. All 3 vehicles were there before I parked my car yet NONE of them had received a ticket (and the traffic warden was no where in sight). The only explanation I can come up with is the fact that my car was a Ferrari and this was a clear case of reverse elitism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it fair that I feel hard done by?</p>

              <p><br>I beleive it's $70 for double yellow .. I can't remember the exact wording but mine was $50 for not following what the sign said .. which was coupon parking Mon/Sat &amp; no parking Sunday's except for trucks &amp; buses. I didn't see the no parking bit until after I received the ticket.</p>
