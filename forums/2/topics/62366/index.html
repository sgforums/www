            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm new in the forum and would like to seek some advice. After reading all that message posted, i know that it is not easy to pass the driving test at 1st attempt. I strongly agree that it really depends on the instructor. Any recommendation for private instructor?  who are good and charging at a resonable price? Coz i know that some instructor are not responsible.<br><br>Regards</div>

Maybe @ first i knew, then i forgot lor....if i still know how 2 do, the car wouldve moved what....i askd for help means i donno wat 2 do oredi lor...$@!#, the instructor tinks i scared of his sarcasm. Choy!<br>Anyway eventually i got the car moving but my instructor kept scolding me all the way. There i was, driving in the cold cos it's raining VERY heavily &amp; the aircon is on, and he was nagging like nobody's business. He started talking abt how he dont want 2 end up dead wth me in a car crash (AS IF i want 2 die by his side also). He nagged and nagged and nagged until i couldnt concentrate properly until i accidentally made some mistakes. As a result, he nagged even more lor..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My instructor often says that i gabra easily but i tink HE's the one who's gabra sia...<br><br>There were a few times, i was waiting to turn right @ a traffic junction, the car in front of me moved forward. I also moved forward a bit lor, cos i know if i dont it'll be 'obstruction' what...<br>After the car in front moved forward, it quickly turned right. I knew that <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">i </span></strong>couldnt turn right yet cos there were oncoming vehicles coming <span style="font-style: italic;">after </span>the car in front turned right. So i never intended 2 turn right first &amp; instead i told myself i'll wait till the coast is clear.<br><br>BUT MY INSTRUCTOR, DAMN GABRA, HE THOUGHT I WAS GOING 2 FOLLOW THE CAR IN FRONT 2 TURN RIGHT. So <span style="font-style: italic;">just before </span>i stopped the car to wait, my instructor yelled "Stop!" I stopped lor, cos that was my original intention what....<br><br>But he started scolding me like mad, saying that i was careless in wanting 2 follow that car in front. He said i got "no common sense".<br>WAHLAUEH...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Years back at BBDC, while going thru the circuit course, the instructor was kinda bored and kept telling me about some incidents he encountered with lady drivers (no offence here).<br><br>He was telling me once while he was with a lady trainee in the circuit, the lady driver stop suddenly and he ask her why she stopped as there was no zebra crossing or traffic junction whatsoever.<br><br>The reply she gave was that there was a crow that was on her path and she stopped. Both of us just giggle our way off.<br><br>But on a serious note, its real danger to any vehicle that's behind.  No wonder he kept telling me not to follow too close to a lady driver thru out the lesson.  (no offence gals, just a lighter side of driving)</div>
