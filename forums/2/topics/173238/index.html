            <div class='col-md body'>Have you checked with your SE? My SE says warranty covers the car, parts and accessories which is part of the stock package.<br><br>So just check it out and let the person servicing you know when you check in your car for the 1000 km maintenance schedule.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if over your 1000 km schedule, then on your next schedule.<br><br>For your chip, yup, as Anti_AhSiah mentioned, the most is the service center will touch up the chip with paint. My collegue also mentioned it for his case of bumper scratch which he did not witness after parking somewhere.<br><br>Otherwise, you will need to pay for full treatment like sanding, painting, baking etc.</div>
