            <div class='col-md body'>Bismarck,<br><br>I am not an expert in this, but i will try my best to relate what my car mechanic told me about the different octane and why different cars need different octanes.<br><br>First you will come across the term "anti-knocking index" in your instruction manuals. Anti-knocking index (or AKI) is the european term for Octane.<br><br>WHy it is called AKI is because it is the index (or octane) your car requires to prevent yoru engine from "Knocking".<br><br>Before I continue, I think what my car mechanic told me applies only to fuel-injection engines. So Rolls-Royce and RX-7 owners.... dun rely on my information. hehehe. And if you are a Rolls-Royce owner, dun think paying for V-power matters to you thus dun jam up those stations offering 8% discounts.<br><br>A higher octane fuel is suppose to combust (explode) more than lower ones. When fuel is injected into the cylinder, the piston would be at the down position and when the spark ignites and explodes the fuel, it pushes the piston up to the cylinder, rotate the cams and axle.<br><br>So in a 4 cylinder engine, pistons 1 and 3 will be down and 2/4 will be up (and vice versa). The rotation of your wheels is the result of this cycle of pistons going up and down.<br><br>Thus using a lower octane fuel will not combust as much and wun push the piston as high it is supposed to and those the rotation would be as complete. This uncompleted rotation four-stroke cycle of the engine thus will cause damage. Not sure of the details, i got a sketchy picture of it, but choose not to relate to you all incase it confuses you further.<br><br>Anyway, the mechanic also say you may use a lower octane fuel if you are driving highway because the increased consistency in revving will make up for the lost rotation and would bring the machine operation into the threshold of the engine design. This however haven't been proven by him yet. And this mechanic is in North America, so his definition of "highway driving" is about 2-4 hours stretches at 130-160km/h. Not like our 20mins stretches of 90km/h at PIE.<br><br>INterestingly, I would like to point out the cars are also "timed" and localised to the market it would be should. Since most Asian countries will tax cars according to engine size, we tend to buy smaller engine sizes but demand more power from that same engine. THe same is true for Europe and that explains why alot of models will have Supercharged or Turbocharged engines (e.g. Benz Kompressors and Volvos). Japanese cars respond by incorporating Variable timing (VTEC, VVTi, VVTC).<br><br>Consequently, manufacturers will "time up" or "time down" the engine according to the market. For example, a Nissan X-trail in Singapore (timed up) uses the QR25DE engine and require a 95 Octane. But in North America, the Nissan Sentra V-Spec or Altima uses the same QR25DE (timed down) but needs only 89 Octane. The difference, X-trial has an output of 179 horsepower and the latter 175 hp.<br><br>It is possible for you to "time down" your car in Singapore to require a lower octane level. It takes about 15-20mins but you will have a decreased output by about 2-6 horsepowers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Folks,<br><br>I'm a newbie at sgForums &amp; this is my first post, so please bear with me. I'm currently a final year student at NTU and I'm doing research into the motor vehicle population in Singapore. So, I thought that I could contribute to the discussion here.<br><br>Research Octane Number (RON) is used as a classification of fuels here. The octane number refers to the proportion of the substance octane (C8H1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> in the fuel to the proportion of heptane (C7H16). Heptane is more volatile than octane and is more likely combust prematurely in the engine. A fuel with lower octane percentage is thus less thermally stable. This may lead to a loss in power and produce a "knocking" noise.<br><br>In Singapore we use RON, the Motor Octane Number or MON may also be used to classify the fuel. The MON just uses a different test to determine the quality of the fuel. Ususally, MON is lower than RON. In the US, federal regulations stipulates using an average of RON &amp; MON to grade the fuel, which explains why fuel in the US seems to be of a lower grade than here.<br><br>In SIngapore, there seem to be 4 main grades of fuel, all unleaded offered by the energy majors. Low (92-93), Mid (95), High (97-9<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and Premium (98 with additives). Currently, the only true Premium product seems to be Shell's V-Power. However, it is the most expensive at $1.386 per litre (before discounts, rebates etc).<br><br>I've tried V-Power and the difference is noticable. The pick-up is better and I get smoother throttle response. It's the price that prevents me from putting it into my tank every time I top up. According to manufacturers specifications, my 1992 Toyota Corolla 1.6 (A) requires a minimum 93 RON fuel, so I use Fusion 95.<br><br>According to my research, 95 RON fuel satisfies 96% of all cars in S'pore and 92 RON satisfies 57%. Using a higher RON fuel provides NO benefits for your car (however, additives like in V-Power do). So, don't waste money buying a higher grade than your engine needs!</div>
