            <div class='col-md body'>Troy437..... please go back to the mechanics and ask him to use the screw driver to push the steel that attach of hold to the behind of the pads..(not really sure what it calls) cos after 2 or more yrs of pressing the pads while you brake it.... it tends to move a bit forward(normal case for steel somemore braking is hot)..... This is what my personal mechanic do and he told that many other mechanics just bochap this kind of "small" thing.<br><br>Japanese made pads OE Aisin, Sumitomo, M kashiyama can last 4 yrs before changing... for normal driving condition. Or i would say.... it wont "harden" just within 2 yrs.... it can last over 4 yrs and not hardened.  Change it at 4 to 5 yrs under normal condition..... as these OE pads are better than aftermarket pads..... unless of those reputable performance pads like brembo or bendix (but these pads will eat rotor up)<br><br>Sanding down is not the correct solution as u will think down the pads.<br><br>note ... IT IS NOT NORMAL as what other mention to have the pads too close to brake disc and have smells.... this is dangerous and over heating the disc mean losing braking power.<br><br>Nick34..... what brand of brake pad u using?</div>
