Until I find a girlfriend or improved my driving skills (to the level of being able to feel the car), I guess I will stick with the small car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why do u want to buy a car if u have just $1.5k cash every mth? Even worse -- u r thinking of buying a new car! cars soak up ur money in no time. Insurance easily cost $2.8k at ur age and zilch driving experience ie. amortisation of $233 pm. Then road tax of 1.5l = $900+ pa or $75pm. There goes $300. Plus petrol? with rising oil prices, u shld easily clock $200-300 pm on petrol costs. That means altogether $500-600 extra pm, w/o thinking abt the instalment or even parking.<br>if u really really want a car, start with a 2nd hand and very old one. renew COE one. no choice.  how abt nissan march? there is one selling for $13400, COE ends Feb 06.</div>

But those who wants to buy a car, most likely it is for fun, comfort and convenience. So if you are talking about how worth-it it is to buy a car, you can't judge in terms of money. Because recently the COE downed so much, that is why the depreciation is so much. If you wait another 1-2 years, the depreciation rate will improve.<br><br>That is why I always think about riding the car for as long as I can. That will save me the lose when I try to sell it off as second-hand car.</div>
