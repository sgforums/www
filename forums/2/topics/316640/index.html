              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question arise because yesterday I saw a yellow F430 being test driven in my school (NTU). It has normal registration plate, and another 4-number plate tied above the reg plate. So i assume its being test-driven. Its the 2nd F430 i've seen being test-driven in NTU, previously a red one appeared. Both times they were loud, shiok. Here are my questions:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Who can test-drive Ferraris, or exotics for the matter? Is it only potential customers?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Are the cars they test-drive usually the ones they own(already bought and just arrived) or are they just showroom 'spares' so customers can get a general feel first then decide to buy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Are there routes to follow when test-driving? Because of all reasons, why choose NTU? I know Lambo and Ferrari showroom in Teban Gdns and Lok Yang respectively. So customers can choose their own test-routes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just curious, hope you guys can help, thanks in advance!!!  </p>

              <p>1) I would suggest that other than the press, only potential customers would get to test drive an exotic. Dealers will normally put clients through a venting process to determine how serious they are before handing over the keys.  </p>
              <p>2) Lambo &amp; Ferrari generally don't have demonstration vehicles, so "test drive" cars are normally secondhand trade-ins or personal cars of the dealership. Even then most buyers don't do test drives, given the majority are current or ex Lambo/Ferrari owners. I for one didn't have a test drive before purchasing my car. Porsche, Audi &amp; Aston etc. do have "demo" cars but again you have to convince them that you are serious, or turn up in something expensive. When I went to Audi to check out the R8 the salesman seemed more interested in my 430 and virtually threw me the keys before I'd asked for a test drive.</p>
              <p>3) I've never heard of a test drive route and would imagine it depends largely on the salesman. When I took out the R8 my wife came with me, so I could go where-ever I liked.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope that answers you questions.</p>

              <p><br>Regret? you're kidding right! It's without doubt the most exciting car I've ever owned. Initially I intended to get a 599 next, but now I'm content to wait for the 430 replacement. Of course there will be a completely few Ferrari model (code name F149) released at the Paris motor show later this year, so that could all change once I've seen that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for servicing; it has 2 major services a year, plus it has a holiday at HSM whenever I'm away for 2 weeks or more. The only mod I've done thus far are the wheels. I thought about putting Tubi's on it but decided I'm quite happy with the stock pipes, as I'm sure my neighbours are as well.</p>

              <p>fellow forumnites, dun be sarcastic by just stating since u can afford this, why dun you get that, etc etc. please be more mature...</p>
              <p>anyway, back to the point. so you mean you will service it every 6 months? do u need to drive the car every 3-4 days to prevent engine brakedown? high rev in low gears? what's your fuel consumption like? ever achieved 6km/l?</p>
              <p>did u upgrade your rims to bigger sizes? ever thought of upgrading the brake kit to the carbon ceramic set?</p>
              <p>seriously, how much will tubi cost? only offered by hsm? i seriously wonder if anybody ever thought of selling just the titanium tips instead. lol</p>

              <p>I agree, a roller is to be chauffeured in (except the drophead of course), and unless I'm completely mistaken a drophead is approximately 2x a fully optioned F430 Spider, not 4x. Just becoz someone can afford a rolls (or any other car for that matter) doesn't mean he has to have it, or is a better person becoz he does. I know plenty of people with a LOT of money who drive around everyday type cars, simply becoz they'd rather spend their money on something else, or just not spend their money. Either way is ok with me. Rolls, Bentley, Toyota; what ever makes you happy coz they all get you from A to B.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The second I start buying cars to impress others I'll start taking a cab! I buy my cars to drive them, and enjoy them (which is why I wudnt buy a rolls). Not because I want to be the envy of everyone else but because it's always been my dream to own these cars since I was a little kid, much like many of you. I'm extremely thankful that I've had the opportunity to own some lovely cars over the years, all bought with my own money that I've worked extremely hard for; something which makes the whole pleasure of owning cars like this that much more enjoyable. Daddy having this and daddy having that simply doesnt cut it for me, simply becoz I'd rather live my dream than someone else's, with my own money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vertmonyet is correct; Tubi is an aftermarket exhaust for exotics. Many Ferrari's and Lambo's in Singapore have it. They cost approximately 8k and can be bought through HSM or independently, and I'm sure you could buy the tips if you wanted to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for carlust; not really. I'm not one of these people who chops &amp; changes cars on a whim. I'm always looking at what I might get next, but actually doing it is a different thing. That being said I'm still in love with my 430.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I drive my 430 every day. Why? Becoz I enjoy it. It makes me feel good to hear to sound of the engine, the way the car drives on the road. Despite opinion, these cars are made to be driven everyday, not once a month like in the past. The 6 month servicing is standard, but like I said it goes into HSM maybe every odd month whilst I'm away for a fluid change and check.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fuel consumption? I've no idea. High revs in low gears? It depends on how I'm feeling. Redline is 8,500rpm and I've hit that in the first 4 gears before, just not everyday (or in Singapore).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The rims are 19' front &amp; 20' rear versus the standard 18'. The ceramic brakes are great on track, but you really don't notice the difference on the roads. They also take a bit to warm up, which for short drives probably isn't optimal, not the mention the price (+S$70k).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope that answers everyone's queries.</p>
