              <p><br>Kenneth, from the moment you started posting in sgForums, i have noticed that you like to day dream. OK, not only me, to be frank, a number of us quiet readers who don't dare to speak up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, we all know about you coming from a rich family and so? Does it mean you have to go around boasting that yr dad drives a maserati quattroporte and has a RR Phantom in HK, and over in Indo your family has a lot more other cars. Nothing wrong with that, but i am just telling you that it doesn't reflect very well on you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our impression of you? A boastful 15 yr old kid who knows nuts about cars and lurking around the forums posting stuff that he is not even sure of. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So we all know that your dad got invited to the launch of the Veyron, ok so? Expect a wow from us? ok WOW. Satisfied?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are probably new to the forums, and you don't know wat is OT. OT is Off Topic. I might be going OT here but do u want me to start a new thread just about u? Here's the thing. This thread is about test driving exotics like ferrarri etc, and real life ferrari owners like <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/235102">dipsomaniac</a> is sharing is experience on driving and owning one, thanks for sharing, it was some very useful knowledge to us. And you? Poking yr nose into other people's business? Asking <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/235102">dipsomaniac</a> whether he is the royal bros banker? What other cars he has? Does all these reflect to the title of this thread?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Over in posting of rare car pics thread, wat r u posting? my dad maybe getting veyron, my dad has a QP, might be thinking of getting this car, wish to have one of these... totally OT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know what kenneth, it will be better off that you go back to studying and revising yr homework, or else you will still remain as a useless person, failing your tests and exams. You will nv get to a respectable position if you carry on like this, and not to say be a private banker...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have said what i wanted to say, i leave it to you.</p>

              <p>Relax,Kenneth is going through a phrase of maturity evolving as he goes through the harsh reality of the world at 15 years old.With some guidance he can be taught the ettiquette of nuetral conversation</p>
              <p>For example,at the rare car pics he did contribute some photos which is good,however what he need to do is to rephrase his post to a nuetral stance,like for example - "Here is a picture of the Rolls Royce which i manage to get a chance to be in" and thats it,enough of the description Ken's extravangant lifestyle(like the further description of the recuperation of the holiday at Europe or USA)</p>
              <p>Unless of course,people do ask him how he got the chance to be in,then he can take the initative to shred a little(and a little,not all) of his lifestyle.This way people wont take that its bragging because it was an answer to a question asked.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was once like that but after some time(and flame),my excited posts of the past were no longer repeated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The basis is - learn and the DIVE method which someone told me last time...i think it stand for something relating to preventing the old ways from happening again</p>

              <p>Anyway,i would like to ask dipsomaniac two questions,if i may?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1st - Are u concerned about the rising fuel cost?I know many people dismiss the cost of petrol since the supercar can already be afforded.Can you shred a little light on your monthly fuel expense.</p>
              <p>If no - Given your current salary(you dont have to reveal it :) ),how expensive will fuel will became over time that you will have to re-consider the price of the fuel and the fuel consumption of the Ferrari(which is naturally high) to make any serious change to your driving habit?</p>
              <p>If Yes - With RON98(i assume it is mandatory for Ferrari for health reason) fuel hitting $2 and is set to rise even higher(as crude oil just rose higher today),have you made any serious change to your driving habit to date? I.e stop using the car for certain days and use taxis or other cars etc.</p>
              <p>Also,have you ever thought or used RON 95 and 92 before?What are your thoughts or experience after using them on the Ferrari?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2nd - Are you ever bothered by the constant stares(if not all the time) of people drooling/aweing at your Ferrari?I do know that it make one a little proud but i think over long period it does become a bit irritating to oneself.Have you also got into any scuffle with any person that become too fanatic to the Ferrari that it became a bore to you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.Just being curious and would like to ask this questions for personal usage.</p>

              <p>oh yeah, i got 1 question to ask too: how do you park your ride on a slop. full hand brake with head down? full hand brake with head up with two pieces of wood? i heard some spider driver once parked it head up and got the ride slide backwards. luckily there was one honda city right behind to stop the sliding momentum. ended up the spider was alrite yet the city got whole front bumper bent in.</p>

              <p>muwrx - I have done a couple of tracks days and I really enjoy the camaraderie of like minded people. I don't do them very often though as they are hard on the car and greatly increase your maintenance costs, but they are a hell of a lot of fun! Driving the car everyday is one of the greatest pleasures of owning such a toy. Whether I've had a good day or a bad day, one thing is assured; my day will be a little bit better when I press that red starter button. I must confess that I been known to take the long route home on occasion. 200km/h in 4th gear? That would be breaking the law surely! Oh and before anyone asks, the fastest I've taken it is 290km/h; I just won't say where haha. Parking on a slope; simple. If it's in gear it isn't going anywhere. Starting on a slope is no different to a stick shift, and unlike an automatic it will roll backwards (into a Honda City) if you let it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ceecookie - I guess I should be concerned about the rising fuel costs but at the moment I must admit that I'm not, simply because I view it as a fact of life. We actually all benefitted from unnaturally low oil prices for many years and the recent rally is more about playing catch-up than anything else; if oil hits $200pb then I might change my mind though. Generally speaking I fill up no more than once a week and only ever use premium, usually Shell V-power with a full tank costing about $140 after discount. You can never expect to blend in when driving a Ferrari and I actually get enjoyment when people stop and want to take pictures of the car, and will generally try and accommodate as much as I can. Two recent examples spring to mind. I was parked outside a hotel and there was a bus full of Indian tourists readying to depart. As I went to leave one asked if he could take his photo with the car, and before I knew it the entire bus had disembarked cameras in hand. 30 minutes later nearly every one had had their picture taken whilst sitting in the drivers seat; and it makes me smile to think that that was probably one of the highlights of their trip to Singapore, and proud that I could make that happen for them. On another occasion I was at home when my doorbell rang and 2 teenagers were standing at my gate. They asked if I'd mind if they came in and took photos of the car, which of course I obliged. The look on their faces when I told them to push the starter button made my day as much as theirs. Probably the most annoying thing is people asking "how much?"; it just seems to be the first thing out of most peoples mouths.</p>
              <p> </p>

                      costs but at the moment I must admit that I'm not, simply because I
                      view it as a fact of life. We actually all benefitted from
                      unnaturally low oil prices for many years and the recent rally is
                      more about playing catch-up than anything else; if oil hits $200pb
                      then I might change my mind though. Generally speaking I fill up no
                      more than once a week and only ever use premium, usually Shell
                      V-power with a full tank costing about $140 after discount. You can
                      never expect to blend in when driving a Ferrari and I actually get
                      enjoyment when people stop and want to take pictures of the car,
                      and will generally try and accommodate as much as I can. Two recent
                      examples spring to mind. I was parked outside a hotel and there was
                      a bus full of Indian tourists readying to depart. As I went to
                      leave one asked if he could take his photo with the car, and before
                      I knew it the entire bus had disembarked cameras in hand. 30
                      minutes later nearly every one had had their picture taken whilst
                      sitting in the drivers seat; and it makes me smile to think that
                      that was probably one of the highlights of their trip to Singapore,
                      and proud that I could make that happen for them. On another
                      occasion I was at home when my doorbell rang and 2 teenagers were
                      standing at my gate. They asked if I'd mind if they came in and
                      took photos of the car, which of course I obliged. The look on
                      their faces when I told them to push the starter button made my day
                      as much as theirs. Probably the most annoying thing is people
                      asking "how much?"; it just seems to be the first thing out of most
                      peoples mouths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>    Its okay..</p>
              <p>    The world is as it is, imperfect.</p>
              <p>    People are misintepreted, misjudged and crucified (Although I don't know why             people do it publicly)..</p>
              <p>    And I wonder why he says I'd fail in my tests, since I go on this forum? Puzzling.        </p>
              <p>    Anyway:</p>
              <p>Somehow.. When you think of an expensive or exotic car like Ferrari, the price question pops up immediately, you just can't help it..</p>
              <p>But some admire cars just for what they are? I would admire an old Jag and smile at it..</p>
              <p>Just because it is beautiful, even though it may have depreciated a lot. Even an old Beetle..</p>

              <p>kenneth. i see that you only replied to what i said about you failing your studies. i might be wrong about that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not replying to other things i mention means that you are guilty of what i said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as you can see, not only me thinks like this, many people have also spoken up after i stated my views. this shows that i am not bullshitting or picking on you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's better you do something about it or else your name will continue to get blacklisted by many of these forumers here as time passes. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ceecookie: i understand what you mean, you are in the most suitable position to speak up for him as you were once in his shoes. speaking from experience... kenneth pick up a couple of pointers from ceecookie and probably things will be much better.</p>
