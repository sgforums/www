              <p> </p>
              <p>you made a good point, but is there any reason to hang another plate above the registered one? To warn other drivers that this is a test vehicle? so that they will keep clear?</p>

              <p>And for your information, who says Lamborghini do not have balance? The Gallardo has bags of composure. And its damping is better than a F430. And it has a viscous coupling 4WD system giving it better traction than a RWD F430.</p>
              <p>The only niggle is there's too much Audi parts in the interior of the Gallardo and its interior doesn't have the sense of occasion of a Ferrari's interior even though materials are of high quality.</p>

              <p>dont really think a 4wd car is better on the track even though of its high tractions..</p>
              <p>hmmm... till date.. the 1995 McLaren F1 is a RWD car.. still has its crown.. even after technology has vastly advanced over the 13yrs.. new supercars still cant really beat the F1.</p>

              <p><br>trade plates are used to cover insurance purposes... car with trade plate attached means that car at that point of time is under company cover. anything happen, company settle, not whoever is behind the wheel. of course only authorised personnel assigned by the company is allowed to use that plate lah. Each trade plate has a certain amount it can cover and it's usually used for higher end cars, etc Jaguars, Bentley, RR, Ferraris, AM and such. Others companies have designated drivers (usually technical advisors or senior mechanics doing QC test drives) with insurance covered under company name, but the limit is lower than given for trade plates. If you notice, trade plates are also used on brand new cars not registered on the roads yet; no car is allowed to be driven on the roads w/o insurance.</p>
