              <p>Hi guys. Gonna take my first attempt TP next week.</p>
              <p>Nissan Sunny, Manual, Private student, </p>
              <p>I have seen previous threads on TP and driving test.</p>
              <p>But some are a few years back, so kinda wanna know the new improvised TP lookout and driving tips.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Is it true that 1st attempt people their possibility of passing is very low?</p>
              <p>2) What happened exactly on that day?</p>
              <p>3) What to look out for and what to do ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks, guys.</p>

              <p><br>according to some driving school instructors, they observed that passing rate is usually higher than average during off-peak hours (10-12pm; 2- 5pm) and at end of week (thursday to saturday). in addition, TP testers have more trust in school learners than private learners since driving schools have a 'systematic teaching-learning' approach.</p>
              <p><br>1. first of all, be confident. second, during warming up car time, must show the tester you check everything before moving out. show him you check all mirrors, adjust seat/ side mirrors, blindspots, release handbrake before moving...etc. then during driving time, you must show the tester that you check all mirrors every 6 to 10 seconds by moving/ tilt your heads to check, don't just literally see from corner of eyes. next, always repeat his instructions to remember in your heart, always signal in advance, drive slowly and carefully to road traffic conditions.</p>
              <p>2. mirror, signal, steer.<br><br>3. tips that are a few years old are still very relevant... the drivers are all still alive... and  the mass market car technology still haven't evolve from wheels on tarmac roads to flight mode as seen in the movies 'the fifth element' and 'star wars' yet...</p>

              Thank you for your reply.
              
              Thats sounds advantageous to me though.
              I got a late weekday and off peak period.
              
              1) Is it true that some tester are all out to fail the testee on the TP day itself?
              Is like biased and stuff? I heard from some of my friends claiming that some tester are just basically 'not happy' with you. Lol. Some sort of luck to see whether a 'good' tester or a 'bad' tester you got. Is it any true?
              
              2) What do they actually look out for?
              
              3) Delay in moving off in any circumstances means failing to move off? Or is it ok that I move off at a slow but pick up after that?

              By nature, malays are more relax and lepak one. 
              Chinese are those kiasu, kiasi, bo lan pa ji one.
              Indian got smell always forget to take shower one.

              <p>Off peak means less car on the road, so you must drive faster, and at the same time remember not to speed.</p>
              <p>Regarding speed. slow does not equal to good. You are expected to drive near the speed limit if road condition allows. e.g. on a 70kmh road, you are to drive at 65-69kmh. any slower and you will be penalise for road hogging.</p>
              <p>1) Impression counts. Testers have the right to pass or fail you. Do not give them additional excuses to fail you. Dress smartly instead of sloppily. Long sleeve shirt and pants gives the impression that you are mature and sensible, and will be a safe driver.</p>
              <p>Dressing like a Beng, stereotyped as the street racer, will decrease your chance of passing, as the job of the tester is to keep unsafe drivers off the road.</p>
              <p>2) They are actually looking out for confidence and drivers who can think calmly when situation arises. Try to give an appearance of calmness, relax and look natural while driving.</p>
              <p>3) Slow acceleration is not considered as delay. Delay is when road is clear, but you take longer than expected to move off. e.g. you stone at a traffic junction for a few seconds when the light has already turn green.</p>

              Oh yea, do i need to readjust my seat, rear mirror, side mirrors to show the TP that i have adjusted? Bcos by right, before I have even drive into the centre, I would have adjusted right?
              
              So do I need to wayang abit or? 
              
              1) Ensuring neutral gear is in before engaging 1st gear. 
              Does it means that I have to verbally say 'Neutral gear is in place, changing to gear 1 to move off' or something like that?
              
              2) After the circuit and outside road is completed, when returning back to the centre do I need to park the car again or just stop at the side road when there is no obstruction?
              
              Please advise.

                  returning back to the centre do I need to park the car again or
                  just stop at the side road when there is no obstruction?</p>
              <p>Please advise.<br> Thanks, guys.</p>

              <p><br>YES! must wayang a bit on all driver adjustments even though it's the same car you using as if it's a new car...<br><br>1) no, you simply say, 'sir, i'm ready to move out.' while holding the biting point.<br><br>another very important thing is to repeat his instructions...<br><br>eg. tester says, "filter to the right lane to u-turn at the next junction."<br>you reply, "yes sir. filter to the right lane to u-turn at the next junction. roger that."<br><br>2) it's where you start, where you park finish...</p>

              Ok. Thanks, Rednano.
              
              Just 3 more qns I could think of at the moment.
              
              1) What is the procedure to do a slope?
              (Signal left, brake hard, handbrake, right signal, step on accelerator pedal till RPM 2?, release clutch half?, handbrake down) Im not exactly sure when and where to check for confirm of safety. Also, I am having problem finding the biting point, is there any tricks or tip to do this? (Eg; relase the clutch slowly or?)
              
              2) When negotiating a bend, is it necessary to turn and check my blindspot? 
              
              3) For parallel parking, I am having problem reversing out. As in, I am quite fluent in parking in, but when my instructor said 'Ok, please move out and turn to the left'. I am always afraid that I might hit the kerb when moving out. Is there any tips to ensure that the wheels wont hit the kerb thus making it a smooth flow?
              
              Please advise.
              Thanks, guys.

              <p><br>where's your private car instructor? may i know you pay money to him for what?<br><br>doesn't he should have do a mock-up TP test with u?<br>it's standard to a driving school instructor/ learner will do.<br>e.g. with him posing as if he's a TP tester.<br><br>you better book him a day or two just before the test to do so for this mock-up...</p>
              <p><br>1) not so sure for this. i'm used to driving automatic car for a few years already.<br><br>2) yes, with a half-second quick glance at the mirrors so that to check see if other cars are turning too close to you when say it's a 2 or 3 right turning lanes.<br>at bends, don't see mirrors too long, since if do so, u tend to steer off course out of your lane (road marking).<br><br>3) in parallel parking, when moving out, just reserve straight 1st slowly without steering.<br>then when in 1st gear, steer fully fast whilst wheels in ultra slow mode.<br>(movement as in "hand fast, leg slow." = it's the same as u-turn.)</p>

              Didnt mention anything about mock-test or something.
              Will arrange with him. 
              
              So am I right to say that I just have a quick look at my blindspot to wayang that I did check my blindspot when negotiating a bend?
              
              I think I got it for the reversing out from parallel parking.

              <p><br>during test, must wayang but since you already take a quick glance, so must also commit the vision glance to your memory to take a visual photograph in your brain.</p>
              <p>please see this for example:</p>
              <p>1) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVwvk2m1WTY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVwvk2m1WTY<br></a>2)<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVwvk2m1WTY"> </a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7A93tydo6k">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7A93tydo6k</a><br><br>you can search for more youtube videos on actual drivers in Singapore...</p>
              <p>please remember hard in mind, even if u later pass already, the real driving test on your skills is the actual drive on the roads. it's your life and your passengers you are talking about and at risk.</p>
