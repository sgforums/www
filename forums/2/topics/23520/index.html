            <div class='col-md body'>Currently looking at getting a small car. Typically 1300cc or less. I'm kind of a novice in cars, so I really need good advice here.<br><br>Maybe I just list some of the cars I have in mind:<br>1) Mitsubishi Colt - looks good, but friends says it's not that good.<br>2) Toyota Starlet - don't think you can find it in Singapore and I think Toyota cars are expensive.<br>3) Subaru Justy - don't know much about this car.<br>4) Honda Civic - I think Honda makes good cars.<br>5) Nissan March - so far it looks a "friendly" option.<br>6) Suzuki Swift - have been hearing very good feedback about this car.<br><br>That's what I have in mind lah.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi iamsilly,<br><br>well since u dunnoe much abt cars, think u can go to 'motoring' and read more abt cars and views, heh.... (promoting that thread lar) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> .........many of us talk abt everything abt automobiles there, and maybe u can pick up some useful tips.....and though me not expert or old bird in this area, hopefully i can give some advise through what i know.<br><br>well 1st, errmmm do u meant 1st hand car or 2nd hand? but from what u name, i suppose u meant a 2nd hand car.<br><br>1) Mitsubishi colt - heard the cars is not worth the value ..... think for the price u pay for it, can get a better car .... and think colt stop production liao, which meant can only get 2nd hand 1.....if i am not wrong. This i am not so sure but though colt is a 1600cc.<br><br>2) As for toyota starlet, think we did discuss b4 in 'motoring', maybe u can take a look there, heard hi-resale value and the reason for stop production is also mentioned.<br><br>3) Subaru justy .....just like u dunnoe much abt it, but think my neighbour drive 1, a 1000cc ......quite a old car ......<br><br>4) Honda civic, unless u r refering to the old 1, GL , a 1300cc. if not, the new 1 are all 1500cc , 1600cc .......dun consider small lor. My family used to own a GL, 1500cc though. Well i dun have a chance to drive it then cos no license. But according to my brother its quite okie...... think u can consider it. Anyway honda on a whole quite reliable.<br><br>Nissan march is the most luxurious 1000cc car in s'pore at 1 stage of time (heard from radio), cos of its leather seats, auto window etc etc ... thus its not a cheap car.<br><br>As for Suzuki Swift, well my current boss is driving 1, a 1000cc ....... everythings fine, but no auto window and the pick-up tends to jerk a bit, maybe cos its a bit old. Comes in 1300cc also. The 1000cc comes in both without booth or with. Think the with booth 1 quite worth the money.<br><br>Other option u may consider:<br>1) Proton wira 1.3<br>2) Daihatsu Charade/Move<br>3) Hyundai Atos<br>4) Mitsubishi Pejaro Mini<br>5) Fiat Uno<br>6) Perodua Kancil<br><br>Regards<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WEll, this one i think i can help...<br>Either get Toyota starlet, Nissan march or suzuki swift..<br><br>Well, Honda Civic road tax and insurance is quite expensive as i think they classified more dangerous coz i think racing type of car...<br><br>Nissan March is the most expensive 1000cc car 2 years back...as much as 78000$ with COE.<br><br>Starlet got cheap spare parts..u can look at the classified ads and i'm sure quite alot..<br><br>i have been Driving Suzuki Swift for many years..Shouldn't have prob. My old SBJ plate got auto-window one..Suzuki swift got one with "buttock" and one don't have..If u wanna get on with "buttock" gotta get a 1.3litre else no power.<br><br>WEll, u got to consider things like Road tax($360 for 1000cc if not wrong, Insurance (abt 800$ for first party) , maintainence...every 3 mth abt 100$ for small car... Petrol....Should be all these lah..<br><br>If your family got many cars...i think insurance also more expensive...someone told me b4...<br>If u r really interested I will suggest u go to classified ads...Call them and ask them ...Then go down and test drive one by one..Make sure u r comfortable with the car...Especially the engine...and the brake...look for dented part here and there and look out for engine oil leakage. Listen for the belt and see the timing is out..u can observe this quite easily... The air con also very important and it's really not cheap to repair it... Ask someone to see the smoke coming out from the exhaust pipe..must sure not white smoke...<br><br>Hmm...hope it helps....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The new COE coming on about 6 mths time. It's kind of open concept, u will know how much other pple are bidding. If it's too high, u can always back out but if it's low enough, u'll not be the 1st to jump in too. It's something like online but i guess alot of them will bid at the very last minute thereby pushing up or down at the very last min.<br>But come May or June, the price of COE might fall alittle across the board coz of the availabilty of COE is alot more than last yr but dun expect it to crash, very unlikely to.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just found out somethign today from my frens today..<br><br>SIngapore's Echo is the Japanese version and is rather different to the American version of Echo. The American verson comes with 1600 cc and 113 hp. And a slight difference in design.<br><br>One thing I dun like about Toyotas and Hondas in SIngapore is that their prices are higher than other cars of its class. Which I think it is easily explained by the monopolising by Borneo Motors and Kah Motors.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>iamsilly :<br><br>heya. sorry for the late reply. shall i break it down for you?<br><br>erhm. yeah. how much do you intend to borrow? the initial lumpsum payment for a $50K car should be around $10K? Then the rest could be borrowed. Say $40K left. Then payment over 5 years with compund interest, that's prob around $800 per month. When you add yearly road tax, assorted maintenance bills, and insurance, that's another $200 per month. Add petrol, average $280 for daily usage, that's altogether $1280 per month.  :p Add fines and car park payment???<br><br>Die leow lor!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I know there are others here with plenty to spare... but realistically, it's difficult to maintain car ownership on your own. But you are right  :p Buying a small puny old car by yourself is better than getting handouts from your parents to own a flashy car. At the very least you can say, "I worked for it. How about you?".<br><br>Ponders :<br><br>Wondering abt the Toyota Echo. Is it the Yaris? If yes, then it's really cool. Cos the Euro model comes with a stock GPS roadmap system.

            <div class='col-md body'>Barclays..<br><br>Yaris? Nope.<br><br>It's Echo. Its a 2000 new model. The successor of Toyota Tercel (not in Asian markets).<br><br>Not sure about Asian market, but Echo is the smallest and basic Toyota in N.American market. SO i guess there is no GPS even in the Euro model.<br><br>And I know Echo is released in Singapore as a few of my frens told me so.<br></div>
