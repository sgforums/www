            <div class='col-md body'>You mean that you don't know that most local motorists don't signal???<br><br>Hey woah, hope you are well awake now!<br><br>Personally, even when they DO signal, I don't trust them anymore. Oftentimes, the signal left as they're approaching, then suddenly just proceeds straight!<br><br>Taxis: when you're behind one, DON'T let your guard down. They make unpredictable moves. Never or avoid driving behind a Taxi.<br><br>At carparks, when there is someone in front of you, and both of you are looking for a space, don't follow too closely. He/she can just stop and begin to reverse into a lot. Normal practice is to tuyrn on hazard lights (both sides blinking) when you spot a space to park so that people behind you, will know.<br><br>This bad habit of not signalling amongst motorists here, stems from selfishness, and pure lack of consideration of others. I don't see any improvments the Courtesy Campagne has achieved our society.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How about car with hazard lights on? That was my experience. You tot the car is gonna stop, but hell no, it's so confusing.<br><br>Another has to be the brake lights. For those car owners with faulty brake light, please for God's sake, go and change it! When there is no brake lights, cars behind will not know when the car in front wants to stop exactly and suddenly it just stopped, it's really scary.</div>
