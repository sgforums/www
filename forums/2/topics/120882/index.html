            <div class='col-md body'>Some speed limits really are ridiculous. My friend's dad was fined before for doing 85 in a 50. It was a school zone. Time was 1+am. When he asked the TP which child goes to school at 1am, TP kept quiet, only told him to wait for letter.<br><br>The problem is lack of flexibility. Obviously only a real dumbass would walk across an expressway, regardless of the time of the day, of course unless he or she has been involved in an accident or vehicle breakdown. There is really no point keeping the speed limits throughout all hours of the day. Think about it, if you were going home at like 2 - 5am and you're on the expressway, and there's no car in front of you, doesn't it make sense to go at least a little bit faster?<br><br>Another thing is, the skill of the driver. One of the quotes from the newpaper mentioned that our speed limits are fine, comparing it with that of Stockholm's and Montreal's and their low-accident rates. Why not compare it with Germany's Autobahns? That's cause the roadways are obviously different. Stupid comparison in the first place. (Go watch Getaway in Stockholm feat. Honda NSX and Corvette if you want to know better). Instead of such ridiculous measures such as deploying very distracting speed traps all over to make our roads "safer", why not try to use that money to improve the skills of our drivers instead? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

Why is that so? Simple. It doesn't make sense to drive slowly on an empty road late at night. If you were to tell me that you keep to the speed limit everyday, and have never once even exceeded the speed limit...erm, I really will find it hard to believe.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  As a pedestrian, you also have the responsibility of looking out for yourself. If you were to cross the road wherever you want instead of using a proper crossing, eg. zebra crossing, traffic light or overhead bridge, then it's your fault as well don't try to bend rules to your advantage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well even if the TP were flexible or lenient, i would imagine that there will be others who would insist in pushing the limits even further? presumably we can never be satisfied with whatever speed limit is imposed. i agree that if you are not happy with driving at the speed limit...take the risk &amp; endure the consequences quietly.<br><br>on another note, i was quite astonished to find that more often than not, you see heavy vehicles (trucks, vans, buses), driving in the middle lanes on expressways.  i sure as hell, also note the big "60km" sticker at the back of their vehicles...just caught one travelling on the AYE at a SHOCKING "90km/hr" for at least the whole stretch of AYE... YL8049T (open truck, 23pax capacity).<br><br>Is this not horrendously dangerous? Are TP's so focused on catching car speedsters, that they forget that other heavy vehicles are simply breaking the rules too, by either travelling too fast for their loads, and/or not being considerate by maintaining in the 1st or 2nd lanes.<br><br>my 2c worth..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come to think of it, when do the majority of speeding incidents happen? Not during the peak hours when traffic is bumper-to-bumper, it's mostly late at night. So what's the point of having the speed limit applicable only during the day (when u can't speed anyway) and removed during the night?<br><br>Actually i agree with i_am_a_p***s, in that we should not raise the speed limit at night, as visibility is poorer and the drivers also tend to be more tired and less alert.<br><br>And like mili mentioned, even if the speed limit were to be raised to say, 80kmh, we'll still find people speeding, this time probably at 100kmh instead of 70kmh if the speed limit were to be maintained at 50kmh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U sounded like God. And u are here to deliver a sermon. The monotonous drone of ur voice (text, here) is making me sick.<br><br>Here is a quote from my favourite song from U2...<br><br>"Have u come here to play Jesus, to the Lepers in your Head?" - One, U2 1992.<br><br>TP should hire u as a spokesman.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by i_am_a_penis:</div><div class="quote_body">On public roads, even during the wee hours, all of us should be driving with the mindset of defensive driving, which emphasizes safety more than anything else. Defensive driving means driving with our guards up in anticipation of mistakes caused by careless drivers and pedestrians and preventing a possible traffic accident. Every driver should try his very best to anticipate imminent collision and try to prevent it as far as possible, even if we are offended by the party committing an error. To point fingers and trying to reason out who is the party at fault only go to show that we are egocentric creatures.<br><br>Even currently when there are speed limit imposed at night, there are already many incompetent drivers who disregard this law and breach the speed limit. If one day the speed limit at night were to be abolished, I canÂ’t imagine those SBS buses, ten-tonners trailers towhead, cement mixer, mobile cranes and chemical vehicles driving at 90km/h on normal roads and cars traveling as fast as 130km/h.<br><br>Â“FlexibilityÂ” is only for those lazy people wanting to take short cuts and get the easy way out. ItÂ’s a negative habit which will result in drivers beating the red lights on a quiet night at a vacant traffic junction where there are no path-crossing vehicles.<br><br>If your friend thinks that he doesnÂ’t deserve the summon, by all means he can write to TP and reason with them based on Â“flexibilityÂ” and see if heÂ’d win the case. God bless him. I hope this lesson will teach him to respect the law in the future. DonÂ’t hate the TP for the summon, tell your friend or whatever to learn from his mistakes and appreciate defensive driving.<br></div></blockquote></div>
