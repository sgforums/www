            <div class='col-md body'>Yup!<br>Poor driving etiquette is one symptom of a society that is not quite right.<br>Treating the symptom will not cure the disease.<br><br>A digression:<br>Once, at my block, I entered the lift at the ground floor, and held the door open for a father and son that was approaching. I waited they did not appear. I looked out and saw the father was waiting for another lift. He did not want to enter the lift I was in. I told him the lift was going up, he ignored me. OK, so I closed the door, but before the lift could move the door open, the man had pressed the "up" button. I call him again, and he ignored me again. His son was uncomfortable with his father. His father do not  want to take the lift with me, and kept pressing the up button before the lift I was in could move. I told him and his son did too, tell him that he should let the lift go up before pressing the button.<br>I thought about that man. He had a dour face. I wondered how he would conduct himself at a restaurant, in public places, while driving etc, how would he interact with other Singaporeans. What has he imparted to his son?<br>I realize, there lies the cause of our ungracious society.<br>Three decades of yearly courtesy campaign come to nought.<br><br>I think our society must be gracious as a whole, before we see improved behavior on the roads and in restaurants, and public places.<br><br></div>
