            <div class='col-md body'>I figure the best way to ease jams in Orchard, is to just close off the entire stretch of road... Let traffic flow around orchard, but no cars allowed to go through... Then they'll have more space for other things... good idea to make a pedestrian mall like Bugis Junction... Then all those roadshows will have more space... otherwise it'll be so packed along the pavements... I was in orchard yesterday... so packed outside Meritus Mandarin cos of those stalls... so hard to walk...</div>
