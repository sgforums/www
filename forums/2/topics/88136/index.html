Per lesson, for off peak hours, which is mon - fri, 8.35 to 4.40pm the last slot... cost u about $56++... If u during peak hours, weekends n week day 1st peak hour classs is at 6.50pm to 8.55... Cost u another $8++ more... INcludes some cents and 5% gst... Total amt i can't remember... Hmm... U can log into www.ssdcl.com.sg<br><br>Meanwhile, u can go to register wif ssdc, but then the waitin time is very long... It will tak u about one mth b4 u can start lesson... I suggest u enblock book... meanin tat u book many slots at a time, coz the slots are really hard to get... Last min bookin very diff to get slot, at the time u r free...<br><br>U can go tak ur final theory after u start learnin to drive... But b4 u apply for test date, u got to pass ur final theory liao...<br><br>SOme people learn their final theory from school... They paid about $60++... I read somewhere tat, if u pass ur basic n final already, u r still required to have another theory class and got to pay so... Tis i not so sure, coz i tak my final theory wif them...<br><br>Feel tat isn' much of a use, except tat u can have access to their comp which got alot of q for u to practise on...<br><br>PDL: u can go up to level 3 there to apply... but then hor, usually b4 2nd lesson then apply lor... Coz hmm... 1st lesson usually no need pdl de, coz u be inside the circuit all the while... Jus stand by ur ic, $25, and ur basic theory slip when u apply pdl...<br><br>Don forget u need a passport size photo when u enrole...<br><br>Another thing is tat, once u enrol liao, u can go to the kiosk, upstairs, the bookin machine, u can go see when there r avaliable slots, then u can go book ur lesson first... coz they give u ur first lesson, is at least 1mth away de... So no pt waitin so long...<br><br>U r required to have at least 25 lessons... There are 33 subjects to be completed, b4 u r allowed to go book for test date... u wait about 2 mths for test date... Meanwhile, u can go for lesson again - revision...<br><br>How much u spend will depends on how many lessons u take... roughly 2-3 k?</div>

Mayb u rest a little while, get back ur enthu, then start again? Have revisions nearby ur test date, say 1 or 2 wk b4? Most impt on the dae b4 have a re? i feel tat on the day  re, lik very tired, wait test cannot concentrate...<br><br>Why is tat u fail each time? WAt r the mistakes u commonly make? Mayb u have not enough lessons, so not stable enough yet? Practise will make it better... Mayb u jus lack confi...<br><br>JIa you wor! Nev give up... Or else, u be wastin all ur efforts... why learn when u can't drive, coz u given up not to tak ur license? Perservance! I passed 2nd attempt, but then i took super long time to learn up everythin... Mayb u jus need more time? I took 8mths, 3 times a wk practically... Equally jia lat for me...I also do have thinkin of givin up, if i failed the 2nd time... Coz is damn tirin to tak the test again n again... Plus so many lessons liao... I see my inst, so i pai seh liaoz...  But i tell my self nev to give up... Coz i learn so long, i bu gan yuan if i don get my license... Waste alot of effort...<br><br>So once u begin on somethin, make sure it has a endin... 3 cheers!

The cost depends on:<br><br>(1) How many lessons you need to complete all 33 subjects<br>- average 20 to 30 lessons, depending on individual progress<br><br>(2) When you take the lessons<br>- peak $67.20 or off-peak $58.80<br><br>(3) Whether you want to book a fixed instructor<br>- extra $8.40 per lesson<br><br>(4) How many revision lessons you want to take<br>- revisions are done when you have completed all 33 subjs and have booked your test date, up to you to decide how many you want, depends on how confident you feel for the test.<br><br>(5) How many attempts you need to take the test<br>- each test itself will cost about $150 (test fee + warmup fee + vehicle rental), plus if you fail you need to take some more revision lessons<br><br>As a guide for you, I spent about 2.3k:<br>- 22 lessons to complete 33 subjs<br>- 6 revisions<br>- lessons mostly during peak hours<br>- paid for fixed instructor for 20 lessons<br>- 2 x theory lessons (took final theory with school, but passed basic before I enrolled)<br>- passed on 1st attempt<br><br>Other costs: Enrolment fees $100+, PDL $25, photocard licence $50, etc.<br><br>Other things...<br>I did Final Theory with the school, found the revisions on their computer system very useful. Just go for many, many revisions, by the time you take your FTT, the questions mostly see before one. Oh, also try to take your FTT after you have taken at least 2 or 3 practical lessons, it will help.<br><br>Btw, there is no min. number of lessons required. Last time they set the min. at 25, now no need liao.<br><br>And try to go for min. 2 lessons a week. In the beginning stages, preferably at least 3 times a week, else you will prob forget what you have learned in the prev lesson. For me, I took 3 to 5 lessons a week, from my 1st lesson to the date I passed = 2 months 1 week.</div>

Corrective action will cost you less demerit points than strike kerb.<br><br>D-change, the turning point may differ for diff pple due to diff height and seating position and so on. Maybe you can get your instructor to point out your turning point to you again?<br><br>Since you find yourself weaker in these 2 courses, ask your instructor to let you practise more in them. For school students, it's very possible to clear the circuit without demerit points one, practice makes perfect! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>haha... mayb coz i m slow learner...

My inst taught me for so many mths, about 8 mths, but i still stress sometimes until my palms all sweaty liao...<br><br>My inst once told me, if u mak a mistake, forget it, coz when it is done, it is done, it cannot be undone... Jus continue to do ur best... Don think too much about ur mistakes, coz as u say, it is very demoralising...<br><br>I feel tat... Mayb u can look thru the pt system, for the test... so at least u have a rough idea of how u do? Eg, u strike kerb, for d.c is 4pts, etc... So tat mayb u won feel so stress up ba...<br><br>U talkin bout s-course rite? Practise makes perfect... U can apply for test date, choose the sat de lor... Or u see when u book out, coz got quite a few dates for u to choose... or mayb wait till ur schedule more stable, than go for it again... But only scared too long, then forget alot of it liao...<br><br>Hmm... u use the 2 black dots, ways will strike kerb?<br><br>I dunno leh... coz is not rite from the beginnin u use the 2 dots leh...<br><br>First, u full lock to the left to go in rite...<br><br>then u adjust a bit the steerin wheel to the rite... to get the center pt in line wif the kerb on ur right side lor... U know the center inbetween the 2 dots...<br><br>Then when about half way thru, u cannot keep the center pt in line wit the rite kerb, coz the curve is left left liao... then u use the right dot to follow the left kerb... Should be no prob ba...<br><br>Mayb is tat u turn in too early or late? Or didn full lock? Try it out ba, since u learn usin the two dots so, it might be easier to follow tis method... coz diff people got diff ways of goin thru it...<br><br>Mayb u consider fixin inst? One tat u lik for ur re, so at least the inst can guide u all tat u need to know for ur test?<br><br>Wat the tester wants to see if confidence... Of coz, sayin is easy, doin is tough... But u really got to act it out, even if u don have confi! All the while, i was actually sweatin... my palms, my legs all tremblin... But keep in under control... At least i m able to, coz i need to concentrate on the clutch... haha... at least prevent me from shakin... When it was over, my whole leg turn jelly n i almost cannot walk back to the briefin room... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Durin my test, i realise tat the tester keep starin at me, to see my reaction, esp when doin somethin considered more dangerous... eg, lane changin,etc... n i got tis really bad habit... each time i do somethin dangerous, or somethin unexpected happen, eg, the car jerk etc, i will ah! I mak lots of noise de, durin my lessons! Noise of exclamation, of scaredness.... Haha... much worst than u hor? Test, no choice, control... keep a st face... The kind nothin can darn me look...<br><br>Really, u shouldn let a small mistake deters u so much... Since it is done, it cannot be undone... sometimes u nev know de... if the tester wants to pass u, they don penalise u so much de... unless they wanna kill... few mistakes they tick can kill liao...<br><br>So jus look st, try ur best! So long as u given ur best, u have no regrets! Wish u gd luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Confi ah!</div>
