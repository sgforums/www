If you are to pay 800 p/m, you still have to think of Fuel, insurance, road tax, parking, ERP.. Fuel alone can cost you 200 dollars per month. For insurance, it will have to depend on how old you are and how long you have driven.. and parking maybe at least 100 per month..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think if you need a car purely for transportation purposes, then I would suggest you go for a second hand, 1.0cc car. You don't have to go for those new, expensive cars. As already mentioned here in this thread, you would still have to allocate for insurance fees, road tax, season parking fees, maintenance and petrol. Do consider all these factors before you sign on any agreement to purchase a car. The deals advertised nowadays definitley look 'affordable' but you reallly have do do your sums to ensure you don't find yourself in a sorry financial state later on.</div>

Some bank will also give higher loan and it all depend on your financial status. In the central bureau, the banks will know your financial status. It is at their risk to loan you an amount that is more than you can cope, which is unlike finance company which can give you high loan at higher interest and some required guarrantor.<br></div>
