            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmmm<br>I still believe in consistence in maintainence.. regular polishing is not necessary to me... I just Polish to a nice finish once in a while... Apply a coat of wax once every 2 weeks... goes a long way...<br><br>Seen people's car with Zymol before... Damn shiny with wet look... but then hor one small container of that "Carnuba wax" cost sgd$1450 so forget it...<br>Among the waxs i tried, Turtle wax Carnuba most shiny but not that lasting... So far Autoglym can deliver results of up to 2 weeks, Soft99 Carnuba wax can last slightly longer... 3M can last ard there also...<br><br>Currently trying out Maguaire's NXT wax...<br>last 2 week ++ with good shine, nice smooth surface and good water beading effects... the NXT result looks promising...<br><br>So far for last 3 years, i have tried many waxs and seen many treatments and non can protect against birdshit... So i dun really believe the crap about any wax that says they can protect against birdshit (esp crow shit)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Tee Pee...<br><br>Congrats in geeting ur new ride.<br><br>They're a lot of polishing company / brand out there.... AutoGlym, Amazing Glaze, Tuff Seal, Glare, Radianz etc...<br><br>Its better for u to get it polish once u get ur new car as its protect, seal and bond the painwork.<br><br>Many of my friends have tried other brands/company of their grooming services and all seem to have problems until they tried Glare. After listening to their feedbacks, I went to try Glare in April 2003.<br><br>Since then, the shine on my car never fail to amaze me. It's easier to wash, get rid of bird dropping etc.  Also, before the polish my car, they use a reader to measure the shine of my car. it was 85. After the whole process of polish, the reading went up to 101.. WOW! And they claim if the reading drop by 10% after the polish in 18 months, they'll repolish your car FOC. Adn up today, the reader measure at 95.<br><br>It's very satisying to see the shine after washing the dirty car.<br><br>The price is $488-00 for 1.6L... please do not get turn off by the price. Glare only polish ONCE and they give 18 months warranty. Many people would get turn off by the price but with simple calculation, you'll find it affordable for the best grooming.<br><br>Assuming to go to a grooming company that give u 4 wax &amp; polish a year:<br><br>You're require to join as member : $50 (estimated)<br>Wax &amp; Polish per visit                  : $320 ($80 x 4 times a year)<br>Total                                            : $370<br><br>Assuming that you pay for 18 months with the other grooming company:<br><br>$80 (per polish) X 6 (18 months, 6 quarter) = $480 + $50 membership fee<br>Total = $530<br><br>Morever, you're stripping off your paintwork and it'll get thinner as you wax &amp; polish. Glare polish are not wax, silicon, polymer etc...,, instead itc consist Glassplexin that bond into paintwork.<br><br>To get more info about Glare.... www.glare.com.sg<br><br>Think currently the is a promo for Wheel Asia member ... 50% off. Think it'll<br>end in Sept.<br><br>By the way, I am not related to Glare. Only wish to share a great product.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO glare professional polish is not that good for the price you have to pay. I managed to get 2 bottles of what they used for about 60SG per bottle. Each complete polish of the car will only use up at most 3/4 bottle. So They are really charging you a huge price for their workmanship.<br><br>Yes Glare polish does last longer than most other polishes I have used, but nothing last for 18mths, The whirls show up after a couple of months only. Warranty? I truly feel even if you have no polish on your car it, the reflectivity will not drop by the amount they quote.<br><br>Overall I think Glare is a good product but at the price you have to pay in SG, it is a rip off<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to go to Parkway Parade for compound car polish which cost about $1400 for 10 times. Then I found out that when you go to car park polishing facilities to polish your car, they polish it without first washing the car or cannot do a good job cleaning the car b4 they polish. Then I found swill marks on the car.<br><br>My friend then intro me to Swissol. Their office is at a shophouse and have washing bay. They take about 1/2 an hr to wash your car and clay bar your car to strip the old car wax out b4 putting on a new coat. I notice that the swill marks are all gone and it even minimise those deep scratches. But their product damn x. The cheapest wax cost about $250 and each polishing cost about $100.<br><br>If you are willing to pay, they are damn good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Saabster,<br><br>Where did u purchase the Glare polish? Me interested cause Glare do not sell their polish.<br><br>Though Glare charged $488 even though the price of a bottle cost only $60, one thing for sure.... mine is already 15 months. None of those swirl mark appear on my car as indicated by you. Also, confirmed by my friends who have done Glare too. Up to date, my car remained in good shiny condition.<br><br>For those who are still sceptical ( just like me initally), you may wish to drop by Glare for the demo ( no obligation) and if any cars being wash there, maybe you could ask the owner of their opinion.<br><br>let me tell u the process that Glare do on your car...<br><br>1. Glare inspect ur car for any scratches or any defect on your car paintwork,<br>2. Glare washes your car with Glare Shampoo.<br>3. After rinsing the shampoo, they'll use Clay bar to remove any foreign particles, stain etc.<br>4. Dry ur car.<br>5. Using the "Hobira" to measure the shine of the car<br>5. Now the actual polish begin.....<br>6. Apply the polish and buff with machine section by section...<br>7. after buffing, they'll apply polish again on the car paintwork and windscreen.<br>8. Let is bond in for 10 mins.<br>9. They'll then remove the polish by usinfgcloth.<br>10. Uses tootbrush to remove the polish from the edges.<br>11. Final inspection.<br>12. Uses the "Hobira" to measure the shine again.<br><br>Viola!!!<br><br>Ps... I was there for 3 hours to see their whole process. One thing to add is their customer service is very good.<br><br>Again, I would like to reiteriate that I do not have any interest or relation with Glare. Just another satisfied customer.<br><br></div>
