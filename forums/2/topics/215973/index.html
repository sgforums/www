            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday for the first time i had to send my younger brother to his poly job attachment location along international road. So was travelling along Pioneer Road north towards international road then out of the blue, 2 black bentley GTs and a red F430 drove by me, i think they all know each other as they were waving to each other when they ultimately turned off, one of the black CGT turn off at Kian teck, the other one turn left at International road and the F430 turn right... must be heading to Hong Seh.  Never knew that when these type of car so slow, their engine still damn loud. One thing i noticed is none of them kena the undercarriage of their car. Neither did i and i have got about 10 cm ground clearance on my lowered Mazda 2. Next thing i noticed is that they all were quite polie wave to each other and were not racing... can you imagine if they were 2 WRXs and 1 EVO? Sure chiong already...<br><br>Anyway, cccording to my bro this is a good place for spotting nice cars as there are quite a few car tuners further down on Lok yang road, Hong seh is also there but the gate is always closed. So my bro brought me to see this multi storey big building with an open air carpark facing International road with supposedly alot of nice cars. We put on hazard light at the bus stop facing this building and were admiring across the long kang the black gransport in the carpark when the Black Bentley GT came roaring in. Wah the sound quite shiok man. The owner is damn young, must be in his 20s... According to my bro this building also has yellow Ferrari 360, Jaguar S type R, Jaguar XJR, New jag XK, BMW M3 and M5 all number plate 500, apparently this young guy will ah beng up his cars with ah beng stickers when he is bored. Don't know the name of the building though, could not see it as we were across the long kang but apparently in office supplies or stationary business. I really find it quite funny to see such nice cars in ulu Jurong. Any off you in this area know this building since you seem to be quite familiar with the area?</div>
