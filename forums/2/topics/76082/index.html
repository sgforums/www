I do not think a car owner can break-even with a 10 years loan if owner decided to sell in 5 years, maybe he/she still needs to fork out more cash to pay the bank first. Of course, if new car price is soaring high, then there is a chance the old car could be sold at a good price and cover the differences... Anyway, don't think this could happen in the near future  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

In such case, Hire Purchase Act is applicable thus no 'compound interest' is payable. Therefore, if ever you wanna sell the car, the loan is prematurely terminated, it is ok.<br><br>With regular maintenance, I don't see why Japanese cars can't last longer than continental. In fact, words have been going around that BMW will have transmission problem once pass the 5th year.</div>
