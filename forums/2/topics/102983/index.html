It was scrapped begining of this year and I must admit it is a good car without having a single major repair (excluding those wear and tear maintenance) throughout it entire life span with us. I always send it to Champion motor for servicing and i believe there is a petrol kisok at Hougang which is also an authorized workshop... but this is common practise - Honda has some petrol kisoks authorized as their maintenance workshop.<br><br>Both cars are compact size and most of the accessories are on par... On the other hand, Suzuki is having VVT engine and not sure what tech. Nissan deploy in it engine. VVT is supposed to reduce the fuel consumption and yet powerful. Ever heard someone telling you Toyota engine consumpt petrol and yet underpower <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> On the other hand, Nissan does... Just for engine, i will pick the new Swift first.<br><br>Finally, Swift is a completely new car and compared to March which has already been on our road for more than a year now and yet not so common... you can sure draw your conclusion now especially both are within your budget...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Judging by the numbers of old swifts and marches still ard on our roads, we can be sure that they are both reliable in the long run. If u've tried the interiors of these 2 cars, u'll find tht the suzuki has more interior space and probably a nicer interior.<br><br>As for performance, the march is quite a good performer with a 1.4L engine, while the swift's 1.5L unit is quite competent as well.<br><br>IMO, i think the swift is a better buy, at $61,000 for the base model u get a 1.5L engine and a more stylish and larger supermini.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi , actually the new nissan march and swift are very different from previous cars with the same name. so i rather you compare existing car models. my relative has driven a swift sedan for 10years, scrap it and change to liana sedan.  Reasons being: the old Suzuki swift has proven to be reliable, it is japanese-made, more spacious, looks more like a car &amp; has enough luggage space.<br><br>i only hope that suzuki can rebrand itself, install VVT engine into current model series. that will produce fomidable machines  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  to compete in the land of asian-made jap cars.<br><br>more details on new shift ---&gt; <a href="http://www.globalsuzuki.com/swift/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsuzuki.com/swift/index.html</a></div>
