            <div class='col-md body'>Does anyone have the Macca's Nordschleiffe times? I'm interested to know. Even its designer Gordon Murray had this to say about the Bugatti:<blockquote>"One really good thing, and I simply never expected this, is that it does change direction. It hardly feels its weight. Driving it on a circuit I expected a sack of cement, but you can really throw it at tight chicanes."</blockquote>The CCXR looks very interesting too. I see they've added a rear wing to it as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
