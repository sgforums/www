            <div class='col-md body'>I didn't wish to go into what he did as recalling it makes me boil.<br><br>We were momentarily stunned by this loud and long burst of horn (the provoking type) from this Nissan who accelerated past us without a safe clearance (if he thought I'd be impressed by his Sunny's 'screaming' I wasn't).<br><br>To anyone of you who cycle, you should be able to understand how unpleasantly shocking it is to experience a prolonged burst of horn from right behind you, without any sound insulation as in a car. The other point of him passing us so closely is a 2nd recipe to a cyclist crashing.<br><br>I'm exactly not sure what triggered him to do such a thing. There could be a possibility that my friends at the back of our cycling line let down their guard and strayed off from the left side of the road, since it was a low-traffic minor road. However, we're always looking out for one another for traffic coming from the back, so I'm sure none of us would have delayed him for so long for him to lose his patience. I'm wondering if he had his headlamps on at that time.<br><br>But whatever it is, nothing should have justified him from doing such an act, which was what really made me boil. As a driver myself, I use horn as a means of danger warning, and I try to minimise any shock by just tapping it, unless the situation is so urgent that I have to keep holding. In this baastard's case however, he was obviously trying to stir trouble.<br><br>When I was beside his car at the junction, I was so boiled that I was refraining so hard from showing him my middle finger or banging on his car. I did yell a lot, in the absence of vulgarities (if my memory serves me right). I'm glad my self-restraint shows that I'm more civilised than him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>normally, in such cases, if I can catch up with the driver, I will blast my HID directly into his eyes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>My wife taught me that, we were cycling in a small residential road when this evo  blast loud horn in the tune of too too    tooooooooo tooooooooooo toootooo at us. We were cycling by the side of the road with ample room for the car to past. We caught up with him at the T junction ahead turning in to the main road. Was wondering all the time why wifey turn her light on then next thing I knew, she was on the driver side, knocked at the windows and point her light directly into his eye.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
