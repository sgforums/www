            <div class='col-md body'>Japanese Altis will be better bcos it oil consumption is low, especially now the petrol prices is so expensive, 5 years ago (2000) 1 litre of oil cost about $1.1, 5 years later (2006) 1 litre of oil cost $1.7, i can predict 5 years later (2011) 1 litre of oil will cost you $2.4. very scary right, wait until 2011 to see my prediction come true......unless they come out with a new sort of energy.....cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am driving a lancer MT. The Fc is quite ok. When on super saving mode... it reach 15km/liter. But of coz need to add some minor parts. A better plug and cable, a good filter(I using open pod now, compare to the stock filther the fc is slightly better when u dun rave too much). Tried once on a really full tank pump from jb, last me almost 700 before i go top up ( combination of city and highway drive from F to E).<br><br>Power wise, for a 1.6 it is considered quite good in the market. For new cars, I would say TS 1.6 is the competitor.<br><br>For space wise, altis would be bigger coz lancer front seat is ok but if the driver has long legs, the rear passenger would feel discomfort.<br><br>As for sunny, although the fc is high, at least the body feels tougher than a lancer as in feel more solid.<br><br>The fc for TS, I would say its on average but when raving, it is higher than a lancer. lancer when really whacked, fc around 8km/liter but ts is around 6-7km. (when i say whack...i mean really whack hard)<br><br>Appearance wise, lancer and TS would be better choice as there is quite alot of room for body kits and design. More choices and it will still look very sporty.<br><br>But one bad thing about the new lancer, is the front grill. Instead of the moustache look, it now look so squarish.<br><br>Things to know about lancer<br>1) The insurance is higher compare to the other cars like sunny,altis.(around 3-5% higher depending)<br><br>2) The parts are more expensive.( On average around 20%-50% depending on which parts e.g front bumper $350, altis around $200-250)<br><br>3) You would be unlikely to find choices for parts in JB as the people there dun really like to get lancer.The choices are very limited.(very hard to find parts and accessories like e.g strut bar, proton for less den 150ringgit can get, lancer need 285 ringgit)<br><br>4) Mantainace if go back to CC, get ready to get your blood suck up.( Imagine 20K servicing+ change pad+change filther = $500)If go outside get, I think can get around 350-400.</div>

But you can always check on various cars FC at MCF. I'm not against altis or its FC but becos people like you who mentioned toyota has a very good FC, i have to stand up and tell you that not all toyota has a very good FC. It only shows that you're either die hard fan of toyota or you're just plain ignorant.<br><br>If you compare FC between vios and sunny, vios and lancer, of course vios wins hands down but if you compare vios with city or vios with jazz, vios is a loser. It depends on which car and model you want to compare with vios.<br><br>Yes, you can give your opinion but your opinion is misleading. Please do your homework first before you give your opinion to the newbies.<br><br>If my opinion is misleading, anyone is welcome to tell me off. Anyone?</div>
