            <div class='col-md body'>By Pawant Singh, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : The appeal of Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) or 4 wheel drive cars has gone into high gear.<br><br>Sales of such cars have seen remarkable growth over the past five years, chalking up 6% of total cars sales up from a mere 1% in 1999, says an industry expert.<br><br>Getting your car all muddy and dirty - that's not an idea most car owners here want to entertain.<br><br>But for some enthusiasts, it's their passion to test the capability of the mean and rugged machines that drives them to extremes.<br><br>And whether one buys it for the look or the performance, one thing is for sure, sales have been revving up.<br><br>"In 1999 and 2001, 1.4% of all passenger vehicles are SUVs. But in 2002 and 2003, it jumped to 2% and 2.8% respectively," said Kevin De Souza, sales and marketing manager at Regent Motors.<br><br>"Last year alone it went up to 4.5%. And this year up to September, you are looking at about 6% of the total passenger car market," he said.<br><br>There are various models in the market, like the Land Rovers and Jeeps which are used for off road driving, and the less hardy models which still offer all-wheel drive capability and the desired look.<br><br>Their appeal has driven some to make the switch from saloons.<br><br>Said Timothy Lai, owner of a 4 wheel drive: "You sit really high up, so you get a better view of the traffic and where you are going. It's also very comfortable compared to the car I used to drive"<br><br>"We go off road every week. It gets the family out of the city and into the jungle. The kids have a great time," said Ray Hyland, also a 4 wheel drive owner.<br><br>Driving in a jungle may not be familiar territory for most Singaporeans, but local owners of such vehicles can turn to operators like Richard Lee who offers training and organises weekend trips to Malaysia.<br><br>"It is an opportunity for them to participate and have fun. If they are game enough, they can choose to go for an adventure trip. Or they can pick a family trip which is mild travelling," said Richard Lee, who organises 4 wheel drive adventures.<br><br>And the makers of 4 wheel drive vehicles are also hoping to muscle in on the Multi Purpose Vehicle market, by making 7-seater vehicles to appeal to the family market.<br><br>- CNA /ls<br><br></div>
