            <div class='col-md body'>my reading was 87 before and 95 after. Evey now and then, i still go back for car wash.<br><br>Where did you have your polishing done? Last time those pple manning the outlet i went were genuinely friendly and easy-going, but since the staff change,  those new guys are more 'hard sell'.<br><br>Guess i will go over to the new outlet by those old birds for my car wash after CNY.<br><br></div>

Kinda of dissapointed though when went back to them over the stains that appeared on my car, they initially insisted those stains were foreign particles not covered under warranty. It was only after some time of explaining that they agreed to service...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no lah, without measuring i already brought up the stain marks issue that they initially claimed not covered by warranty liao. They wouldn't want to measure in case they scared i ask them why the reading drop and what remedial action they have ..

I do have to polish myself every now and then to keep it shinny lar and ocassionally go back to them for car wash if i don't have the time.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi D16Z6,<br><br>If u r interested in 'maintaining' ur car's wet look, u shd try Megueliars'  Quick Detailer mist and wipe. Started using it recently and noted that it does help to restore a bit of the wet glossy look (though not permanent effect lah).  U may like to try that everytime after ur own car wash..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
