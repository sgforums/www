            <div class='col-md body'>it is like that one lah. Have to see their face. They have power to pass or fail as they like. People who drive steady can fail, people who drive scarily can pass. All look at their mood.<br>THen also they see your numberr of times. 1st time very difficult. I pass at 4th test, he see my record also like ching chai, never mark any thing on my sheet. Go out the road, then keep talking cock, then back at the centre, talk a bit more and then give me a pass.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dunno if it's true or not but heard from my instructor that this testers has a quota for passing students..... During my TP test, there's a total of 16 students taking the test but only 5 of them passed, 11 failed. Can you guys  imagine in one day, there's a total of 9 TP tests. 16 students x 9 equals to about 144 students taking a test in 1 day. Out of the 144 only 45 of them passed if base on the passing quota of 5 passes in 1 TP test. If 1 TP test cost about $170 per student &amp; 99 of them failed, that means traffic police gets about $16,830 per day &amp; this is only based on 1 driving centre alone. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Now, if that's not easy money, I don't know what is.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think your case is you act smart la but no offence really. Honestly, I do not see the point in memorising the test route at all. Best is just listen to what the tester has to say and do according because you have to keep in mind that he calls the shots. If he keeps mum, then go straight la. If unsure, then ask to confirm and execute after confirming. Even for me, my test route was modified without my knowledge when I was on my TP. Only realised it when I got hold of the test route map.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>frankly speaking, i would suggest those who wanna take up driving to find a pte instructor. things at bbdc has changed so much. the so called "fixed-group" instructors now has 4-5 of them in a grp! so do u think its worth paying the extras for fixed instructors?<br><br>2ndly, if u're on the normal scheme; u get any tom dick or harry but u are paying over 55 bucks for a lesson. 3rdly, the test dates. say suay suay u failed ur test u gonna wait for mths before u can get an availabe slot. so whats the diff of going pte? my personal thoughts are going pte are more valued for money.</div>

Last he said was that I must improved my driving awareness &amp; straight away tick the fail box!<br><br>Now I have to wait till Dec for my re-test just because of the one silly mistake. Hopefully I won't be getting the same tester again. If not............ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>Before your tp test ? did your instructer tell u that no MATTER WHAT ... even if it a right turn in front .. always attempt to go back to the left lane unless ... they a car blocking the lane or u really can't keep back to the lane ...<br><br>U fail to do that.. and now u are here.. complaining about this and that... it time to really start thinking dudex.. if u go back for the second time with the same thinking and attuitde .. i think u will fail again..<br><br>Anyway the testing has the right to change the route ... my instructer tell me dun be kpo and ask tester.. if he keep slient .. just go straight...i believe u have been brief before correct ? i have been told by countless time during my training ...</div>
