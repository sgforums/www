Just got to accept it as it is unfortunately whatever they say is final.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Just a word of caution , for my TP I knew the route because it was the same route that my fixed instructor had taken me without fail on every road lesson. I was lucky to get the same route for my TP. Even though you need to turn right, no matter what, just pretend to at least make an attempt to keep left or else u will get 6 pts ( I think pls correct me if i m wrong) for failing to keep left (road hogging).<br><br>If you show him you wanted to keep left but if he asked u to remain in the lane then nothing to say. He will surely give u directions so just keep left in future. Just follow his directions as he might choose to go wherever he wants as they can change the test routes.</div>

Was driving on Paya Lebar road, and there were many bus stops ON the road. I was keeping left deligently and overtaking when there was a bus stopping at the bus stop and immediaetly kept left again. I kenna deducted 6 or 8 points for driving in a zig-zag manner.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> The tp told me to keep centre lane if I know the traffic condition is like that.  I told him my instructor insisted that I do that and apologised and promised I'll learn from it (make him feel good lah).<br><br>At the end, I had 2 points more than the passing mark.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  i was all prepared to take the test again, however, as most of my other deductions were due to kia-suism and were on the safe side that won't caused accident (like stopping at the junction too long before moving off). He thought for a while said I am a safe driver and struck off 2 points somethwhere and passed me on my first test. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Those points deducted for being too kiasu are usually 2-4 points and usually from second offence. One act of recknessless or failure to check will hit you hard - 8 to 12 or even immediate failure.<br><br>Moral of story - be kiasu, check everything and be humble.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
