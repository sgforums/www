            <div class='col-md body'>if u sell your toyota now, definitely u going to lose a few 1000.. furthermore old cars are pretty difficult to sell nowadays after the major drop in COE price.. however, for long run usage, i think picanto is much more economic. First of all, i agreed that the fuel consumption is quite low. if i m not wrong, i can go 16-17km per litre. Secondly, u dun have to worry abt maintanance issues at least for the first 3 years as the warrenty is covered. Lastly, the amount of installment u r paying now as compared to a new picanto is around the same so might as well get a new car.<br><br>I have a few info for u regarding picanto: 36,999 is without leather seat, sports rim, and body kits. u have to pay another 3000 for all the above mentioned. The interior is not spacious. There is no power window for rear passenger doors. There is no power side mirrors which mean u have to manually adjust it. Better get a manual one cos it is only 1000CC.</div>

Cause most likely you have to top up some money to sell or scrape your car. If you seriously interested, pop down Kia's showroom and ask for a quote for your car to be trade-in. That should give you a rough idea of the numbers you are expecting.</div>

I don't know the rates that well, better approach the SE of your dream car. Even if you lucky to sell it off without making a lose (very un-likely), you still have the interest to clear which amount to some S$3k-4k. So on top of the value of the car you want, you still have to top up a few Ks. In conclusion, you should have gotten a new car 3 months ago. Now, you have to work it out with the SEs for your loses.<br><br>That is why I am always advising others against getting second-hand car with full loan. Just isn't worth it.<br><br>Lastly, Aveo5 is a 1.4cc hatchback from Chervolet. Decent car with good power and normal FC of about 12km/L.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>frankly speaking, i think you are stuck with your COE car for the next few years liao. If you have to use 6yrs to pay for 18800, that means you have little cash to cough up for the losses. 3 months ago? cars were already getting cheap around that time, you still buy COE without checking out the market?<br>As long as your COE car pleases you, why not use it for a few more years? Car will be even cheaper(hopefully) by then. That will be a better time to change a car. Buying car is like this, when you buy, price then drop. Like me, my COE was 16500, thought it was cheap enough liao. Buy, then COE fell 14000, then 12000. What to do? As long as i love my car and is able to finance it, dun think of changing other cars lor...if can change, i also want to change to mazda 3, alfa romeo, pergeot307, ford focus. So many cars to seduce you...</div>

Whatever you pay now will extend another 4yrs of driving. Next year, whatever you pay will extend driving for 5yrs and so forth... So every year the calculation changes as scrap value of your current car gets lower and you will pay more to extend driving for longer period.[/b]</div>

Basically, you are in a die lock now. Do seek out some SEs for the detailed calculations. Can't advise you much without knowing how much you need to cough out.<br><br>Now the situation is whether you can survice the losses that comes with changing your car, not whether at the end of the day will you be at a better deal.</div>
