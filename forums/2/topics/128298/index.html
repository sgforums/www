            <div class='col-md body'>hyundai accord 2.4? good point but personally the design of sonata seems better than that of accord. i'm just talking about design as i don't have much knowledge on other things. there could be many aspect to choose a car and it's combination of aesthetic, psychological and most importantly (at least for me) money factor.<br><br>btw, according to info (paris motorshow) I got the peformance and fuel consumption was that "The base four-cylinder displaces 2.4 liters and delivers 158 horsepower while an optional 3.3-liter V6 serves up a substantial 230 hp with 10~14km/l drinking? sipping?".<br><br>up to now, i used to drive 4 different types of jap car which i can see too many on the street now and then. for us, IMO, the image of vitec could be illusion as i could not find any differences, possibly i don't have skill to pull out it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hyundai <span style="font-style: italic;">Accord</span> because it looks so much like the Accord, esp the rear and some say front too, and too bad, accord was launched first, so I have the tendency to bias-ly think that Hyundai is copying.<br><br>Paradoxically, I would not equal the the copying as negative as Hyundai has managed (rather successfully) to copy with elegance and here they have a handsome looking car.<br><br>It would be a fallacy if you book a car based on looks alone, and like you have pointed out, there could be many aspect to choose a car. Why not go down to the showroom to test drive one to see how much it dawns upon you before even considering the next step?<br><br>I actually did not know that there is a 3.3 V6 engine out there but there is little possbility that Komoco will bring them it factoring in the road tax. Even if they did, probably they would be low demand. I used to think who would buy a 2.7 Hyundai (Santa Fe, Trajet, etc), but a handful proved me wrong. IMO, 10-14km is quite optimistic for Hyundai (known for its bad fc), it might get a little thristier that as the car ages.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you free4ever. Partially I agree with you. However i do not concern much about FC itself as I only travel 15,000 to 20,000 km per year.<br>. Travel distance/yr: 20,000 km per year (oil price/liter=1.5SGD)<br>- case 1: FC=8Km/L, gas burned=2,500L, cost=3,750<br>- case 2: FC=10Km/L, gas burned=2,000L, cost=3,000<br>- case 3: FC=12Km/L, gas burned=1667L, cost=2,500<br>. For this example, there could be 1,250 SGD difference per year between better FC and poorer FC cars, though I don't think there could be such a differences FC-wise supposed that I do not think of "oportunity cost" which may generate bigger 'utility'.<br><br>here are some image/perception on imported cars(truly my own opinion, as layman for a car),<br>- Honda cars: other than streem the design of the cars are outstanding. interesting thing is that whenever i look at civic, i remind sabb. i like almost all the design of them but it's somewhat exagerated.<br>- Toyota cars: the design of toyata is not as outstanding as honda but the price is more attractive. i heard kanban system of them is world-leading, but they used to be notorious car manufacturer like hyundai a few year back or now.<br>- Mitsubish: all the new model seems worse than previous design (esp. front)<br>- Nitsan: they have some outstanding engin but under-evaluated. but i don't like the design of them. up to now I've never driven any of them.<br>- VW: I had chance to drive GTI and the impression was too strong and I felt I'm protected<br>- Subaru: complicated image. AWD and turbo tech seems outstanding but the design of them is too poor except the latest legacy. I've never driven any of these models<br>- Mazda: the first impression of these 3 and 6 was greate, but I was sick of it too soon<br>- lexus: this car alway make me confusing, as the evaluation from US and UK is so much different other than RX300. they wish to be a BMW but nobody say they are pacing with it. but new gs300 design seems fabulous, and i found some similarity with new sonata (if we draw both roughly)<br>- kia: I like the new sportage design, it's manly looking and i the design of picanto seems smart. when i saw newspaper commercial on the price of this car i kept reading it the amount again and again.<br>- Hyundai: the design of Matrix seems brillant and new sonata design (additionally i want to know the opinion of current drive, as I saw a few on the road).<br>- mini: i want to have it but the number of family members stop me from buying it. i wish i could go back to single whenever i look at this car<br>- porche(997(only code name though) silver colour): this is my dream i wish i came true in my 50's.<br><br>above is the conception on the car within my reach (other than the last). sometimes i go down alexandra and drive some but the first impression/image of these cars prevent me from choosing right one. so i wish to get some opinion from Wu Gong Gao Jia.<br><br>****** accelate it only when you can brake it **********</div>
