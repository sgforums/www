Costs around $13800.</div></blockquote>Hiya again!<br><br>Sorry, not familiar with the Swift.....so I can just give general comments:<br><br>(1) Swift is good because its not a "hot car" in Malaysia.  You will appreciate this very much if you go in often.<br><br>(2) Manual gear is good because it reduces a lot of problems.  One of the most feared breakdowns is in the auto-transmissions - very expensive and the problem is usually recurring.<br><br>(3) The Swift SF310GL was known to be an economical car during its time.  Due to the age of the car you're looking at, its performance in this area may not be that good due to wear and tear.<br><br>(4) Considering the car's age, you probably won't be able to sell the car again...so do be prepared to keep it till the end of its lifespan.<br><br>(5) For old cars, it is very important to check for rust spots.  Many are hidden.<br><br>(6) After taking over the car, you'd probably have to do some repairs - full servicing, change brake pads, maybe change tyres and clutch, etc.  Better get a mechanic to check it, yes.<br><br>(7) Since its a COE car, the road tax is higher.  After 10 years, it goes up by 10% per year, till max. of 150% and stays there.<br><br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> I'm not sure about the insurance though...never owned a car that old before.  But a simple phone call to any insurance company will get you the answer right away...<br><br>(9) If you travel through the Causeway, toll fees are negligible lah....a few bucks each time only.  Parking in downtown Singapore is more expensive than the tolls for going across.<br><br>(10) Don't expect the aircon to work very well, if you happen to be caught in a causeway jam.<br><br></div>

If you haven't got a car loan, that means you paid cash in full, am I right?
