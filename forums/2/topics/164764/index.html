            <div class='col-md body'>On average the OMV of a City is around 14k while the Vios is around 12k. The difference of 2k is then magnified by the Govt Taxation systems of ARF, Customs, GST etc etc etc (total a factor of 2.35) so the difference amplified to be $4,700. The Vios (A) is going for around $52~53k and the Basic City (A) is selling for aroung $59k.  Minus off the difference of 47 and the rest of 1k + are additional Profit for KM. BM is a volume driven company becos it's a listed company. KM is a profit driven company becos' its listed on KLSE not in SGX. Hitting the number 1 spot by volume have never been KM's strategy in Singapore if you noticed...</div>

Tks<br><br>Still, i was under the impression that all companies (whether listed or pte Ltd) are always profit driven, regardless of whether you sell in volume or offer a premium vehicle.<br><br>Honda cars have always seemed on the pricey side; evidently, from a technical point of view, their product is level with BM for most of the chassis. But the price range they offer is always significantly higher. When you consider the difference, there does not seem to be any worth investing in a product that reaps equivalent returns when compared to a competitor.<br><br>After all, cars are liabilities, after 10 years, most people scrap them.<br><br>The only reason i can see is that Toyota has achieved a creditable namesake in the market and can afford to dip their selling price based on the assumption people go for value-added quality. Then their manufacturing EOS kicks in to permit heavily discounted prices.<br><br>Honda prefers to tap a niche market by trying to classify and market their models as special products which will be worth a little more, enticing those who prefer an exclusive appeal that accompanies their vehicle ownership.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can I just add on....<br><br>The philosophy of Honda and Toyota is totally different.<br><br>Honda seems to be heading towards R&amp;D, investing heavily in engineering and coming out with better product. Is it where the VTEC orginate from and if you looked at Honda cars, you can tell that the engineers ready thought through every details.<br><br>At Toyota, it seems that the company is focusing on efficiency and reducing cost. This explains their manufacturing process does not only revolve round EOS but also comtemporary cost savings methods like Keiritsu, kanban systems as well, better known as JIT techniques. The savings are passed back to consumer by either offering a higher spec model at the same price with competitors or lowered price, or (usually) a combination of both.<br><br>Taking the Vios and the City as examples, not only is the honda model more expensive on paper, it is also more expensive in terms of lesser equipment. The basic Vios 1.5E cost around $5 less than the basic City, but on closer examination, it seems the equipments are rather different too...among them are ABS, Alloys wheels, airbags, power output, etc...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honda City's auto isn't just any auto car. It have the steermatic feature inbuilt. Plus generally bigger in size, if that doesn't justify the price, then by all means get a Vios. Just a thought.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
