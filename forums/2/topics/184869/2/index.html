When they're watching tv, see if they can do anything else or not(beer drinking and eating peanuts not counted). women, however, can watch a tv show, cook, be on the phone, and iron clothes at the same time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I always feel there are 2 types of female drivers.. fast n furious but skillful... those careful and slow but not much common sense ( meaning causes of most accidents)...<br><br>and the bad part is most ladies i seen are the latter... its good to practise safety but they overdo it...<br><br>road hog- just because the limit put 90km/h, they travel that speed so they have the right to stay on outer right lane without regard of the cars behind losing patience..ask them to travel 91km/h they tell u its speeding yet they wanna stay on the lane..<br><br>signal n blind spot- more often than not, ladies signal when they change lane but never check blind spot... to them, when signal means " ok i'm changing lane, i signal liao means i coming out so i have the right of way.. y should i check blind spot?' scary thinking! isit so difficult just to turn ur head for a sec? what do they learn when having driving lessons?<br><br>parking- need i say more? their parking sucks! i not saying if u take 1 or 2 trys only then u are a good driver.. but  then do u really need 10 trys? are  their judgement that poor? and the P plates sign are no excuses.. u passed means u are good enough to handle a car urself... and this is usually the case for ladies driving big cars like MPV or camry or cefirio..<br><br>PLEASE! cant handle big cars then please drive a smaller 1... a toyota vios or suzuki swift will also bring u to your destination..<br><br>But overall u cant say men are better drivers though.. i seen lousy 1s oso...<br>but just too bad the ladies are more <span style="color: red;"><strong>"outstanding"</strong></span>...<br><br>Just my 2cents! cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
