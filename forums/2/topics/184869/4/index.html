            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wbucket:</div><div class="quote_body">Now, you are being sensitive and point of arguement might be bias. I am just removing the "WOMEN" from the title and replacing it with "your mom". I even kept the cap on for "MEN" to keep the sentence as closely related to the title of this thread as possible.<br><br>As for using race track record to determine which sex is more superior. This would goes back to the definition of "good driver". Where most argue that a good driver equals to one who can drive normal, safely and having good judgement on the road, there are others who argue on the pure driving attribute, meaning the ability to control the car. Since MEN are easily distracted, being un-able to multi-task as well means more mishap. However on a track, everyone would be more concentrated on purely driving the car. So it might be in this contents that MEN's ability of controlling the car is more significant.<br><br>Anyway, you didn't answer me that is there anyone you know personnelly that can drive as good as your MOM, more even better? I hoped you can see the open-ness here for discussion.</div></blockquote>Ok, as an ex-racing driver myself, 1st i have to tell u that in pro-circuit racing, if u even needed to focus on controlling the car, u're way out of yr league. Car control should have been drilled into your subconscious reaction, where small and constant corrections to the controls should be made without your conscious decisions, like balancing while riding a bicycle, or balancing on a tightrope. If on the race-tracks a driver need to focus on controlling the car, then he/she probably should go back and train some more.<br><br>Next, in motorsport, there are a large number of parameters for any racing driver to think about during a race. How hard to push, tyre wear, fuel load and fuel consumption, engine's condition, tactics etc. Do i sit behind this competitior and wait for the pitstops? Do I overtake? Is he/she costing me too much time or will the reduced fuel consumption from my being stuck behind help me gain a few more low fuel laps before my stops? Things like these. Woe is the driver who cannot "multi-task" in a mental sense, on the race-track. In this regard, logically, women should be even better than men on tracks. On what few occasion that men have ALLOWED women to compete, and given them the opportunity to do so in competitive machinery, women have done well. And in the case of focus, of which the required focus for racing is 'mental sharpness', women have proved to be equally capable, if not more, of sustaining a sharp mental edge lap after lap.<br><br>So whichever way u look at it, your argument is flawed, because the truth is, driving itself is a very 'multi-tasking' chore, on track or on road. If your argument is that men drive better because of their ability to concentrate on one thing only, then that is really men's handicap in driving, and your argument is no longer sustainable.<br><br>As for knowing anyone who drives as well as my mom, no. My dad is accident free for about as long as well but I don't deny sometimes I get scared riding with him. Sometimes it can be a bit close for comfort. When I'm doing normal driving, I prefer not to take chances. Everyone has a luck account and I prefer to take chances on the track than off it. Don't empty out your luck account too fast u know? U never know when u might need it.<br><br>And about an open discussion, are YOU prepared to throw away the old social assumption that men are better drivers and accept that women are better? The root cause of women not being good drivers is social as well u know. If society was drilled into thinking its a 'gal thing' to drive, like shopping and painting their nails are, u're going to see a lot more girls start bothering to pay attention to driving, and they're going to be much better at it than men are. The fact that many women can't be bothered to drive properly is because society sees driving as a 'guy thing'. And before u say this is bull, how many of u guys can be bothered to put in the effort into doing something which is a 'girl thing', like painting yr nails? Its this social biasednesses that makes people feel they don't need to put effort into doing something thats "not meant for their gender". Gender itself doesn't decide driving ability. Social prejudices do.</div>

Your gender statistically has a higher accident rate.  Otherwise insurance companies won't be offering females a lower premium really. That is quite a telling thing isn't it?<br><br>Anyway, nail painting is just a metaphor. there are a thousand and one things i can point out that u won't show much interest in doing. And just like there are some girls who don't paint nails, some guys who play netball, their gender alone does not have an impact on how good or bad their skills at the particular task are.<br><br>as for things that distract, I'd have to say that both genders can be very guilty of that, its definately not a thing which is done by majority of the girls and minority of the guys.<br><br>in the end, i just want to point out that its stupid to say women are lousier drivers because of their GENDER. Good for u if u're not saying that.</div>

So u're telling me u always make sure u are the slowest to move off at the lights? road hogging is not very considerate either.<br><br>u're just nit-picking on something to call inconsiderate. U sure u don't live in a glass house?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
