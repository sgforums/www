Male or female? (Actually I really don't know, taking a wild hit to see if this can proof my point.)<br></div></blockquote>Well. Most track racing records are held my men. But there is a reason for that, and it has nothing to do with diving skills, rather, it is a socialogical reason.<br><br>Remember that motor-racing started in the late 1800s. In the Victorian era, much of the world still had a pre-dominantly sexist attitude, all the way thru to even modern days. I mean, if we look at the things u say, u'll know that even today sexism is truely well and alive.<br><br>So back in the late 1800s and early 1900s, because socially, racing was a "male" thing to do, women did not do it. So men have had almost 60 to 70 years of having literally no female opposition within motor-racing. Now who do u think is going to set and hold the records? Even today, motorsport is seen as a very "male" orientated sport which means women get far less opportunities within it to advance, regardless of skills. Besides, men do not like their "traditionally male" activities to be opened up to females. It just makes them feel their "manhood" is being threatened or something. But every few occasion we've had females in motorsports, they've always been mixing it with the best.<br><br>If u took most men out of motorsports and allowed women into it at the f:m ratio of 9:1, and let it stay that way for another 70 years, why don't we see who holds all the records then?<br><br>Using motorsport records as a judge of which gender is more skilled behind the wheel is really not very relavent <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Why don't u say that men are as good a driver as my mom? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And male drivers? unfortunately they just present more bad examples of driving than good ones to me. My mom is short, barely 150cm high, yet has no problems judging a huge merc E200 to perfection. I've seen way too many bigger sized men in smaller cars crash their cars all the time. Or else hit someone while parking. Smack trees, spin off etc. Men can't seem to judge road conditions properly. And just because she is accident free for over 10 years, my mom's not the sort who does 90 in the right lane. IF conditions allow, she does go up past 3 digits. Yet she doesn't put a foot wrong. Sure maybe u get some women drivers who just look at driving as another chore and thus do it badly, but then u get loads of crappy men drivers too, so how come the few bad female drivers set the standards for women while the few good male drivers set the standards for men?<br><br>In the end, u just want to see your gender as the superior gender don't u?

I am just removing the "WOMEN" from the title and replacing it with "your mom". I even kept the cap on for "MEN" to keep the sentence as closely related to the title of this thread as possible.<br><br>As for using race track record to determine which sex is more superior. This would goes back to the definition of "good driver". Where most argue that a good driver equals to one who can drive normal, safely and having good judgement on the road, there are others who argue on the pure driving attribute, meaning the ability to control the car. Since MEN are easily distracted, being un-able to multi-task as well means more mishap. However on a track, everyone would be more concentrated on purely driving the car. So it might be in this contents that MEN's ability of controlling the car is more significant.<br><br>Anyway, you didn't answer me that is there anyone you know personnelly that can drive as good as your MOM, more even better? I hoped you can see the open-ness here for discussion.</div>
