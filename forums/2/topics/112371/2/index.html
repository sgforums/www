I do think that while the Murcielago is powerful, it's not exactly a featherweight(read: porky) and that at a tight circuit like the TG circuit, it won't be easy to shake off the EVO. Anyways, that EVO does have 400bhp afterall, and that is quite a lot. If anything, I would label the larger frontal area and its aerodynamics as areas where it can't be compared with cars like Lambos n Ferraris, otherwise, it's a bloody good car. Where accel is concerned, it should be as good as any of them,(if you're in the right gear  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ). It only really loses out on top speed, and that, like I said, is due to the aerodynamics of the car.<br>Eh.... that testi prob couldn't see your lights. Those supercars have SUCH crap rear windscreens. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
