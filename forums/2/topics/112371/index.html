Its even faster than the Zonda, and I know how well sorted the EVO's chassis is. So 6 months ago, I was already impressed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Anyways, JC can overtake.

Anyways the EVO8 MR VFQ400 costs about 47,000 quid, which would be about S$150k without import tax, road tax and COE yet. definately going to be about at least S$200k, possibly as much as $S250k IF its ever cleared for import into singapore.</div>

That was never meant to mean that it's a slow car, just to show the turbo lag.

James Kay was very specifically told to spin at that point. Look at the way he spun. No attempts to correct the slide at all, and that wiper bit was for show. IF u were racing n your rears were spinning so much that coulds of tyre smoke was blowing from them, u'd lift off a bit to attempt to gain rear traction.</div>

Its just that the producers aren't going to risk damage to both cars in a real overtaking attempt. Of course, that said, the TG track is quite a tight one. If they were racing at, say, Monza, perhaps other great racing tracks of Europe, which are more flowing and less mickey mouse, I'd say the Lambo should be able to stretch its legs and pull away from the EVO. But not by much.<br><br>another point. JC's lines aren't that good. James Kay's lines are much more precise. I noted a couple of apexes where JC took too early an apex.</div>

Too tight a track. Although I can't say for sure about proper circuits. Afterall, the Viper has dominate the Nurburgring 24hours Enduro for the past few years.</div>
