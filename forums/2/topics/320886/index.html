              <p>Like that also dont appear to be your totally friend's fault both times. It's really quite unfair to terminate halfway also, at most during insurance renewal that time, dont renew then terminate. But halfway termination is really quite unprofessional.</p>

              <p>Singapore not only got ntuc and aig, got a lot of other insurance companies, look around for the best price and best coverage. Not say big insurance company = neccesarily better.</p>

              <p>Like that also dont appear to be your totally friend's
              fault both times. It's really quite unfair to terminate halfway
              also, at most during insurance renewal that time, dont renew then
              terminate. But halfway termination is really quite
              unprofessional.</p>

              <p>Singapore not only got ntuc and aig, got a lot of other
              insurance companies, look around for the best price and best
              coverage. Not say big insurance company = neccesarily better.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... then my mistake for using the word "terminate"... The letter, as typed in my first post, mentioned declined renewal...</p>
