              <p>when u got your license, you cannot just rent a car and drive. you need to gain experience on small roads and get familiar with the car. there are many "things" u need to gain on the road, this can only be done through experience. </p>
              <p>It is of no surprise that everything is wrong. it is lucky that u did not hit any car or people. </p>

              <p>Important thing to note:</p>
              <p>If you are on probation, do not attempt to do illegal U-turns. You may be lucky once, twice but not everytime. Imagine a TP who saw you doing that illegal U-turn and even bang the kerb.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>I believe your 13 points is very precious.. I can afford to do a few illegal U-turns though..</p>

              Scary. I just passed last month - very unsure with the rules. Can i know what constitutes an illegal u-turn? we can only u-turn if there is a u turn sign right?

              believe this incident will make u a better driver.</p>
              <p>Important thing to note:</p>
              <p>If you are on probation, do not attempt to do illegal U-turns.
              You may be lucky once, twice but not everytime. Imagine a TP who
              saw you doing that illegal U-turn and even bang the kerb..

              <p>I believe your 13 points is very precious.. I can afford to do a
              few illegal U-turns though..</p>
