            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br>Last night i was driving as it was a cold night, i didn't switch my aircon on.. As i was driving, i felt hot air blowing from under my steering wheel.. and hot air coming out of the air con.. but my temperature gauge was all right (4/10).. So i drive into an alley and decided to check it out.. it turn out that the engine is overheated.. So i walked to 7-11 to get mineral water to help to cool down the engine.. When the engine is cool.. i open the radiator cap and saw that the radiator water level was quite low so i add a bit of mineral water in it till full.. and  decided to rush home.. Luckily, on my way back home the engine was ok..<br>So any comment on what should i do now? do i need to go to flush my radiator water as i mix it with mineral water?</div>
