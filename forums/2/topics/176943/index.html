            <div class='col-md body'>edminski i think u forgot his main concern for the car which is what will happen if he sell in 2-3 yrs time which means depreciation should be the main factor. and 2nd hand car depreciation will be lower and also since paper value is higher for older cars he will not lose as much as the price he buy the 2nd car wil be near to paper value den a new car.<br><br>as to blurblur84. if u wan get new car my advise is not to get 10yr loan. an alternative will be to put slightly less downpayment and take a 6yr loan. use the spare cash to pay off ur higher installment for shorter period and u will pay less interest. den if u sell 2-3yrs time should not be a prob. but of cuz it still depends on market forces.</div>

Soon, you have to change tire,change timing belt,air con no good etc. I experienced this b4. Bought a 2nd hand 2years old Lancer. Wah, i change this change that, ended up paying extra near $2k.<br>So you have to be careful whether is the 2nd car good or not. Look out for the car's tire. See whether is it going to wear off soon. Test drive the car, see if the brake got any squeee sound. If got squeee sound, dont buy cos the brake rotor may going to spoilt soon. Change rotor + brake pad cost you abt $500 ah<br><br></div></blockquote>i think u forgot the most impt point. why dun u calculate if u drive both ur cars for 1.6yrs which one will lose more money...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>New car:<br>1) New Road tax absorbed in the car already ( for 6mths? old cars usually have road tax left too)<br>2) Low maintenance cost ( both car cost should be the same. just that u need to overhaul the 2nd hand car once straight after u get it estimate abt $1k max)<br>3) Low monthly instalment ( low instalment but longer loan period)<br>4) Some cars give you free insurance ( for a year only)<br>5) Re-financing.
