              <p>that being said, as a cyclist, do look out for traffic as you are not as protected as the people in cars.. and even if it is someone else's fault, there's no percentage in it if you are smashed up in the crash...</p>

              <p>Yes Insg is correct. <br><br>You violated the traffic rule. Pedestrain light green is for pedestrain only.Â You are to alight and push your bike across.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>At least do the decent thing, stop at the traffic light first , make sure the driver see you first before you cycle across.</p>
              <p>Remember the car driver get the green light, he/she check no pedestrains at side of the traffic light , he/she start moving, then from out dash a cyclist, remember you on a bike you actually is coming out of a blind spot which driver will not see. Â </p>

              <p>Cyclists riding across a pedestrian crossing are a danger to themselves as well as a nuisance to drivers.</p>
              <p>A driver approaching a pedestrian crossing can gauge if a pedestrian is near enough to stop or not. But not when it involves a cyclist.</p>
              <p>The cyclist moves faster than a pedestrian on foot. The driver approaching the pedestrian crossing would see no one at the crossing and the cyclist at a distance. But as the driver reach the crossing the cyclist could also be there. And the cyclists would just ride as if they have the right of way, not realising the danger.</p>
              <p>PRC riders I feel welcome being knocked down at a pedestrian crossing. I get this from the way they ride across the crossing. Their attitude, "pedestrian crossing you knock me you pay".</p>

              <p>There is reason why the traffic rules says that cyclist is supposed to get down and push the bike across (rather than cycle across) at pedetrian crossing. Sure, it is inconvenient for the cyclist, but it is for the safety of the cyclist.</p>
              <p>Pedestrian crossing are designed for pedestrian crossing. This explains the existence for simulataneous green light for pedestrians and green light for turning vehicles (at pedestrian-crossing) . A "walking" pedestrian generally takes more than 7 secs to walk across a junction. But a cyclist can do it 2 secs. A motorist may not even notice a cyclist when he makes a decision to turn.Â </p>
              <p>The most dangerous spot is at two-way cross junction, as right turning vehichles are occupied with looking out for on-coming vehicles,pedestrian crossing, traffic signal change, and may just attempt to turn right when the coast is clear. So, cyclists really shoud not attempt to cycle across such pedestrian-crossing, for safety sake.</p>
