            <div class='col-md body'>My dad is goin to sell(or scrap...his choice) his Suzuki Swift. Was planning to buy a van, perferrably running a diesel engine.<br><br>I sucked when I'm looking at other vehicles other then cars. Any good brand/model recommendations?? Was looking at the Renault Kangeroo, kinda cute looking, but European products tent to be expensive.<br><br>Perferr the van to have a low C.G., wide body so it won't look as it could topple over at a bend(Suzuki Carry is definitely out), and a nice compartment to install ICE. HP no very important but must be enough to go up a slope(at least as steep as the 1 in BBDC) with a full payload. Wheel/Tyre profile not important. Gear shift best be manual. And of cos, low fuel comsumption...hee hee. I'm not asking for too much am I??<br><br>If anyone got a pic of his van's ICE compartment, could post it here so I can have an idea for this "project"(going to codename it IVEC) when the van arrives. Remember to remove ur number plate before u post the pic here for security reasons... thanks.<br><br>P.S. There goes the Suzuki Swift, and my SMSA dream goes along with it... T_T</div>

Note: Petrol engine out-performs Diesel Engine at higher engine revs.<br><br>Anyway, the vans nowdays look very similiar in design, now I have to look into their details, performance, payload space, C.G., price, fuel consumption... so much homework to do...

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by slikpizz:</div><div class="quote_body">ever considered mercedes vito?</div></blockquote>Well err... Mercedes Vito... not bad, but itz a little too big. I'm looking for something smaller, but thanks for the suggestion.<br><br>Just went to the showroom in Car City(AML) today, very huge place(1st time there), damn, they sell all kinds of cars, Evos, Rexes, S15s, GT3000s, Porsches, GTIs, EG6s, CRXs, you name it!! Hmm... never see any Skylines there... Oops, back to the topic.<br><br>My dad and I saw a van(ground floor), very similiar design to the Renault Kangoo, itz the Opel Combo(Germany made, Jap engine).<br><br>The specs itself defeated the Kangoo hands down. The interior is a little larger than the Kangoo. Haven't test drive it but there's 1 thing tat catches me, althought itz only 1700cc(diesel), itz Turbo Charged, like the Caddy(1900cc diesel turbo charged). This means potential to me.<br><br>As for the comsumption, you guys wont believe me if I tell ya, for 100km(combined), it use 5.8L, while Kangoo uses 6.8L. But thats only on paper.<br><br>A brand new one(Combo) sells for $35K++, anyone got a brand new pricing for Kangoo?? Or a VW Caddy? Or a Berlingo?<br><br>Haven't check up on Kangoo, Caddy and Berlingo yet, I think I'll go to the Toapayo Renault showroom to checkup on the Kangoo tomorrow.<br><br>Checked the websites but can't find the Caddy, could anyone post the specs(powerplant, diminision)(stock) here?? It'll will be very helpful to me. Thanks. Going to see a decorated cargo compartment of a Caddy of my friend's friend maybe next week.<br><br>And if one is looking for a 2nd van, is there anything I need to look out for? Dents? Rust? Defects? Mileage?</div>
