            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm - the IS200?<br><br>I'll say it's a nice car, but it's not something that you'd really want to fling about.  If you push it, it always feels like it's understeering at the beginning of the turn - after that, it's fine, though.  I've been told it's something to do with traction control and the rear-wheel-drive configuration not being wholly compatible, and I hate fighting with a silicon chip for control of the car anyway.<br><br>Look, I'll be the first to admit I'm biased.  I like cars that have a bit of edge to them, and I've been spoilt by experiences like sneaking in a 220 kmh run down Melbourne's Eastern Freeway in a Maserati Merak.  Mind you, the panel beater just finished working on it and he took me for a test spin - he did the reverse run at 243 kmh, the maniac. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>With that as a caveat, I'll say that the IS200 is a nice machine for cruising down to the supermarket with, but sporty isn't exactly a word I'd apply to it.  Personally, I prefer BM's 3-series still, maybe one of these days I'll try an A4 for comparison.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wonder whassup with u unbelievers. The fact that i have a racing licence for the better part of 2 years is too incredible huh? my offer to ANYONE who doesn't believe me is to arrange a day to meet me and i'll SHOW YOU my godamn licence. hows that? now who has the damn guts to come and meet me and admit they're wrong?<br><br>quit thinkin' a driving licence means a lot of anything. the fact is i could have taken it 2 years back but i choose to focus on my racing and get the racing licence 1st. Your dumb logic of not having a driving licence means i have no rights to talk is totally rubbish. I bloody race almost for a living, while i am not michael schumacher or even any of the drivers in the junior formulas, I dare say I know a lot more about vehicle handling and stuff than most of you out there and this is not a baseless claim. how many of u have experienced understeer during racing conditions b4? how many of u have CRASHED due to it b4? u guys know the tip of the iceberg from your everyday driving and u seek to correct me? in another 10 years pals.</div>

And now it turns to go karts. It does take skills to handle a go kart no doubt of which you are an expert, I doubt many people would even come close to u.  But unfortunately its not the experiences on karts that we are discussing here.<br><br>Fact 1: You shut down the car without having tested it before.<br><br>Fact 2: U claimed to have handled road vehicles on circuit before you entered NS, making u what 16 17 yrs old? Thus allowing you to put down cars which you have prior experience except based on stats. (This is not the only car mind you) Giving you a benefit of doubt I would like to witness such miraculous driving of road vehicles. Of which now you say that you don't do anymore due to NS, understandable I suppose.<br><br>Quoted from Heng<br>"u have a driving license so what? What do YOU know of vehicle dynamics and stuff? How do u even know what to look out for when we label "handling" in a car? Have u even tried drifting anything?"<br><br>Now you lead to challenge me on Go-karts, out of the scope considering totally considering<br><br>1. I am there to observe your superb driving, not compete cause I am bound to lose totally.<br>Quoted from Heng<br>"a piece of paper that allows u to drive on PUBLIC roads.<br>Nothing that says i cannot do private testing on private circuits so dun assume i've never driven b4.<br>and if its credentials u want, mine will blow u away. so don't even try."<br><br>2. And you are putting down a normal road car designed for everyday Road uses. NOT go Karts not an F1 car.<br><br>So unless you are going to demonstrate your handling skills on a Road car thereÂ’s nothing to go on about. If if you are gonna bait me down to go Kart wif u I admit I lose, are you going to deprive me of your demonstration because of this?<br><br>Anyway man of your credentials should have no problems in getting around simple NS matters,<br><br>" SAF ain't like your employer, so kind."

            <div class='col-md body'>one simple sentence.<br>Go-karts it is due to location's convenience sake. Unless u can show me a purpose built circuit in singapore for cars, don't bother wasting my time asking me to go up to malaysia if u can't even handle an easy go-kart decently.<br>its easy really. if u were so keen on going up to malaysia, u would take me up on this. i didn't say u have to win. i said u have to be DECENT in a go-kart to justify me spending the time and effort to arrange to go up to malaysia.<br>or the alternative would be to wait till june, when i've gotten my licence and do not have to bother others to drive my car up for me, and when i've ORDed and am a free man, to head up there. how? go-karts or wait? its up to u. i have been stating my offers here, u have been just trying to punch holes everywhere trying to weasel out of the deal.</div>
