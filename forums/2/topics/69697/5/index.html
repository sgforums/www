Hell if u want i'll even let u meet my team boss and my coach. hows that?<br>Anyway for the record, I got my licence in 2002 June or July, 1st Race in July, finished 4th. 2nd Race in Sentosa, finished 3rd last. Subsequent races all club events, finishing somewhere from 5th place to 2nd place in about 5 or 6 races, Offical ranking in the Singapore karting championship is 8th for the year 2002(there were 4 rounds, i only took part in one). year 2003 no more national level championship, only club events. Al the above infomation is pertaining to karts. b4 that, i tagged along with some a friend and his friends when they went to malaysia. U could go look them up if u want, even i've lost contact with them, because they're hong kongers and have flown back to hong kong. but u can check, my friend's name is Daryl, and he was racing with me at sentosa as well. Oh as for the TP thingy, well i only got the licence in june or july 2002, and i enlisted in 2001. if i had known to get the licence earlier who knows i may be at TP too? sounds like fun there.</div>
