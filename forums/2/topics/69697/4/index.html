            <div class='col-md body'>Actually my friend got his IS200 when it was going at the all time low of about S$120k. For that price, its going to be a luxury vs performance decision. He obviously went for luxury. Its a nice comfortable ride and you are surrounded by a nice interior and leather, plus its nice and quiet on the inside. On the other hand, one can always get a silvia S15 for about that price. Not as posh (aiyoh, I dread writing this becos I am going to get bombarded by S15 owners) but the fun and performance is there. Actually, I wanted to get the silvia, but the 280bhp versions were no longer available. I for one definitely prefer performance and the growling for the muffer to silence that the IS200 offers.<br><br>When my friends indicate the choices of their purchases, I would often ask them to think about the other cars which are in that range and to make an educated decision. At the end of the day, we should focus our anger on the people who are still making us pay tens of thousands to buy a piece of paper in order for us to own a car.... peace OUT!</div>

C'mon itÂ’s very simple I just like to see you perform in a real car which you claim you do very well, more so I was willing to go down anytime you were having your practice. For someone of your credentials I am quite surprised you donÂ’t do so on a regular basis.<br><br>Bottom Line: You put down a car based on your handling skills of normal road vehicles, so till your handling skills show or otherwise thereÂ’s nothing much to go on about. So If its after June that you will go down and practice so be it, keep me informed. Meanwhile please try not to put down any car you deem unfit, if LTA had done things your way the variety of cars on the road would be halved.<br><br></div>

For that price, its going to be a luxury vs performance decision. He obviously went for luxury. Its a nice comfortable ride and you are surrounded by a nice interior and leather, plus its nice and quiet on the inside. On the other hand, one can always get a silvia S15 for about that price. Not as posh (aiyoh, I dread writing this becos I am going to get bombarded by S15 owners) but the fun and performance is there. Actually, I wanted to get the silvia, but the 280bhp versions were no longer available. I for one definitely prefer performance and the growling for the muffer to silence that the IS200 offers.<br><br>When my friends indicate the choices of their purchases, I would often ask them to think about the other cars which are in that range and to make an educated decision. At the end of the day, we should focus our anger on the people who are still making us pay tens of thousands to buy a piece of paper in order for us to own a car.... peace OUT!</div></blockquote>Exactly, its a japanese luxury car built for normal driving, and the Toyota engineers have done a good job of it. Handling and driving wise its a pleasure for road usage. Sporty with a good interior, and if a car's not made to look sporty then wats the use of designing one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, as most races go, it's consistency that count (even for a 10-20 lap race)<br><br>And when comparing cornering abilities, understeering cars can be pushed beyond the limit without ill effects (just feather the accelerator, and the nose will get back in line), while an oversteering RR car can get into all sorts of problems when entering a corner a tad too fast. Either the car has to brake too deep to get any decent speed out of the corner, or the driver has to be prepared for an armful of opposite lock and pray that only a slight drift will occur (and not "lift off oversteer").<br><br>Even in Singapore, I've seen quite a few Porsches chicken out before entering a corner, many a times chasing a "beng" in a Civic. This happened a couple of times at the YCK to TPE bend (approximately 500m of high speed cornering) and once at the CTE Havelock exit (surrounded by walls on both sides).<br><br>On BMW SG Forum, there was a post (sometime last year)regarding a Porsche that crashed while street racing at the TPE YCK bend.<br>It basically bounced from left to right to left, after oversteering and the whole ar fish tailed into the railings. It took out a couple of other cars as well. Fortunately the driver wasn't badly injured.<br><br>I do agree that a 4WD monster is better at cornering, but there's still some turbo lag, and due to the weight penalty (ITR is much lighter than an EVO), the acceleration isn't too fantastic between the corners (except on the long straights). And the new Vtec engines are really quite something. Most Race-tuned vtecs hit 9000rpm, and they sound more like superbikes than a sports car.<br><br>I really thing that watching them on the track will show you how much better an FF car is, than what most people imagine.<br><br>Even the heavyweight FF Volvo T4 will be able to keep up with a WRX (not STi), and even overtake the 4WD monster if the driver slips up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
