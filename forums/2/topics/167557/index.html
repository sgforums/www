            <div class='col-md body'>Juz like the topic says, lets start a thread of stunts or action done by other drivers on the road. It can be dangerous type or fierce ... any stunt which you deem unqiue and wans to share... post it here.<br><br>I will post first.<br><br>3 weeks go at Kallang Indoor stadium, i was parking there at the carpark.<br><br>Saw this indian/mixed or dunno wat race, raving his 645 up and down along the road, estimated, 80 on the corners. @ 1 corner saw his beemer front left really damn close to the kerb and he did double braking, when his car stops, he still can take a laugh and continue dashing. He almost let his beemer eat kerb liao still can luff and chat with his fren in the car... crazy fellow. I believe he was in the group of beemers who parked beside Mac car park, saw minis n beemer clubs there. Concurrently saw odyssey club pple at the indoor carpark.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this stunt i saw from a video clip when i was taking my class 2a theory.<br>It was on the expressway. A towing truck was on lane 1 trying to use its crane to hook up a stranded car. There is a small space inbetween them(truck and the car). THen got this taxi(dunno the co, cos it is at night) came at high speed in lane 1 and then very quickily change to lane 2, do a 180deg turn and slot nicely into the space inbetween.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This driving course I attended once had a really mischievous instructor. Mr Sean Khoo (some of you might know  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). He sat on the roof of a Stilo Schumi Edition and was driving the car around for quite some time, using one foot to steer while resting the other one against the outside of the driver's door. Lol.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>peepz.... try to post things that happened on singapoe road. There are bound to be some drivers doing crazy stuff. Its just a matter of did anyone get to see it. Take another case for e.g<br><br>On last sunday, along geylang rd towards kallang, a blue CS3 wanted to dash for a right turn after lor 6. You know.. the 2 right turns and u r back to geylang rd on the odd numbers / sims drive. It was supposed to be 1 lane turning right but he took the left lane  which was going straight and turn together with another car. As his speed is quite fast, the first lane driver slowed in the turn and the cs3 skid from 2 lane before cutting back to lane 1 to do the right turn to sims drive and stops in front of the red light.<br><br>I tink this thread is not getting good response. Time to change topic.<br><br>Hai~</div>
