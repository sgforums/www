            <div class='col-md body'>Am thinking of getting an Evo VIII and am wondering what are the currently prices out there. I know C&amp;C is gonna bring the Evo VIII at about S$154k. Is it really worth getting from them (i.e. interest payment, 3 year warranty, etc)? Or are the parallel importers still able to give better prices and interests?<br><br>Plus, my friends keep insisting that the EVO VIII is not a car to be kept for 10 years - too cause too much problems. What are your views?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br><br>me not too sure abt the price of an Evo 8 but through parellel importer, you definitely get to save a few thousands. Furthermore, most importer d give customer free servicing as well, and warranty......this is their value added service.<br><br>I'm sure an Evo8 will have no problem lasting 10 years, as long as you go for regular services.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah... cannot wait to get my hands on it.  I am not a crazy driver who will race thru the streets - life is more important than that, esp if it is not your life that your might just take away. I just like to have the power to totally <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>irriate taxi drivers </strong></span>when I get the chance.<br><br>Brian - I am sure you can do the math. Interest for 7yrs about 2.2% for 10yrs 2.45%. Depends on your upfront deposit. From my due diligence rounds, I find that most parallel importers insist that you take at least 80% loan. I guess its the only way that they can earn. Road tax about S$1.5k and insurance... thats another thing that one must consider, esp those who just passed their driving licence, below 30 yrs and no NCBs. Heard of a 21 yr chick, who just passed who wanted to buy a celica (2-door car). Insurance per year was over S$9k - thats of course the extreme.<br><br>Stylomilo - I love yellow cars - stupid obession began with E36 M3 when I was studying in Oz. From then, supercars = yellow cars. Its my obession and its stupid, I know....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> And i spoke with a dealer while he was on his smoke break. STi JDM or Evo VIII. His conclusion - EVO VIII more sophisticated with the AYC and ACD-like stuff.  STi more raw and its more fun on the track where you can afford to whip your tail out (oversteer). Such driving not advisable on public roads. Net-net, EVO VIII more intelligent car and nicer car to drive. STi - raw and more unpredictable.<br><br>Lastly, if you manage to watch Top Gear on BBC a couple of weeks back where they tested the EVO (ok, it was the 301 bhp version) vs the STi. The EVO was number 3 on the fastest around the track list - faster than any ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche or Merc - of course faster than the STi.<br><br>[/quote]</div>

I sourced and scanned the newspapers, took endless trips up and down AML, visited Sin Ming... finally... after the depressing CPF cuts - I finally got the guts to place my order for a yellow Evo. I must say that it was scary, my first car and everything. I sorted everyone's views... from my MD to my colleague sitting to my right. Conclusion was to get the Evo while you are young.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I must say that I think I got a reasonably good deal. Titanium turbo for S$148k immed delivery with sunroof. Now I just have to find a good service centre.<br><br>Somethings that I found out: GSR has a intercooler and the titanium turbo model - the latter has a better turbo system compared to the former. Models manufactured betw end-Jan to mid-July had a recall to check for a transmission issue involving the 6th gear. Do not change the rims - they were specially made for the Evo.<br><br>Thats all I can remember - hope this helps anyone who is looking to get an Evo.</div></blockquote> rem to update us e car performance, consumption and maintence k? den hw much u pay 4 ur insurance?</div>
