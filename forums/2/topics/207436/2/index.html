The person driving at 160km/h while looking where he's going or the person looking at his handphone trying to key in the number plate of the car in front while driving at a law-abiding 120km/h? Speeding and reckless driving are not necessarily the same thing and from what you mentioned, he was not causing you any danger. In fact, driving fast can be safe depending on the conditions. Driving at 160 can be safer than driving at 120 with the right car and driver.<br><br>Please also do not post other people's number plate on the forum. What are you trying to achieve with this? How would you like it if somebody reports you to the police for driving at 120km/h or if somebody posts on the internet that your car with ****** number plate was seen at some sleazy night club? Maybe you really are a nice guy that has followed every single rule all your life. Even so Saint Niceguy_123, I suggest that you should edit/delete your posts to show more respect for other people's privacy, or this will be reported to the moderators of the forum to take action. Do you like to be saboed in public as well? Try to think more carefully next time before venting your boredom in such a tasteless manner.</div>
