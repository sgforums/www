            <div class='col-md body'>I'll have a camera to take down pictures of the damage to reduce chances of extortion, esp the inner sides. He may be taking opportunity to get new stuff.<br><br>I dun think you have any obligation to pay for his rental, if it was not written in the memo. It is merely for his convenience. but you know, things like these are very subjective one. I won't pay if it was me though, as it wasn't written in memo.<br><br>If reallly must pay for rental, then I ask him to deduct the petrol and parking that he saved by not driving his own car.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do the letter have any date?? Do you have a copy of the letter and invoice of the repair listing each of the items?? What are the content inside?<br>In term of law and insurance claim, the letter is not really acceptable. It just serve as a reference to the case.<br><br>In term of damages, did you state in the letter that you will pay IN FULL AMOUNT?<br><br>As for paying of the car rental fee. I don't think there is a need to... firstly, he did not seek ur advise before he actually perform the act of renting the car. Secondly, the amt of damage on the car (even after he overstated the cost of repair) allows the owner to drive the car ard and do the repair at his leisure time without compromising his working activities.<br><br>Cheers.<br></div>

Frankly my advice is you should have told him to go to Ida for damage assessment . Even you go claim insurance, your insurance will not give you as you didn't go to IDA to file accident report, and repair is done with proper paper work.<br><br>There is alway 2 side of the story also. I got hit by someone from behind at a junction, which like your case look like some scratches of the bumper, but what we did was to send my car to IDA for accident inspection. That when the real damage is full found and recorded, according to the IDA guy, you can take all the pictures you want which look like surface damage, but in a full inspection will review more. Like my case, the bumper is cracked and some metal damage which is hidden .  Well send in to repair to replace the whole bumper which took 2-3 days. Of course my job need me to travel everyday to tuas everyday, thus I need car rental. Thus bumper 1000 + and car rental a few hundreds , he charge to his insurance.<br><br>Well if you want to bang into someone which is your fault, then of course the other side have the right to claim car rental, because some people do need a car to move around.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I had a similar accident like yours, I bumped the person in front of me. We were both honest and helpful people and decided not to report to the police so that we both didn't have to waste time at the police station or at IDA and my insurance didn't have to go up. He would fax me the bill and I would pay him back in full. In a few days, he had a bill faxed and I sent him a cheque. Case closed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Thats kinda the way it should be handled if you know the guy is quite nice and honest but if the bugger you bang is a total ah beng, then just go through the formalities, call the police, file a report, go to IDA, call your insurance, etc!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>No fun getting into an accident, thats why I stress safety first!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Going to Idec for assessment is nice, but it will not date the damages.<br>IDec will only list all the damages on the car.
