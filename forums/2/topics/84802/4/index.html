I drive a W211 E200K, and much prefer it to my previous drive, a Volvo 940 Turbo. Yes, the Volvo's interior was much simpler in design, especially the analogue AC and accompanying swtiches, but I much prefer the modern fascia of the E200. FYI, Mercedes Benz has been employing the foot mounted hand brake on most its mainstream models since the late 1980s, so if you infact have driven 'many Benzes' including the aforementioned S and CL500 im sure this wouldnt be as much of an inconvinience as you so claim. Since the W211 uses three rear headrests, the button is there to aid reverse driving for prolonged periods of time as well as visibilty, so there is a purpose to it...And, as with EVERY car on the market right now, including Proton Wiras, you will need to read the car's Owners Manual to get to know it well before you drive. I wouldnt say that the fact that you couldnt set the memory on the front seats is the car's fault, as I can do so with ease... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

The SL55 AMG, however, is one of the quickest cars on the road today. It would overtake an S60R, or any other Volvo made, with <span style="font-style: italic;">ease</span>. The car is stated to have 469 wheel horsepower, but Automotor Und Sport have dyno tested the car at 509, and this is combined with an extremelly high torque rating of 516 lbs/ft. The car has been consistantly tested in the sprint to 100 km/h at less than 4.4 seconds, and this is with limited traction because of the high torque and bhp figures being sent to the rear wheels. The truth is, as many car enthusiasts know, the SL55 AMG is <span style="font-style: italic;">quicker in most sitations </span>than a Lamborghini Murcielago. The Volvo S60R can barely crack 6 seconds to the same speed. Infact, Autocar UK recently tested both the S60R and the SL55AMG in a sprint to 0-160-0 km/h, a realistic straight line and braking perfromance test. The S60R was the slowest car tested, even behind the Peugeot 206 GTi, and the SL55 AMG had a time more than five seconds quicker...I dont have anything against Volvos considering that I have been raised with them, but the S60R is nowhere near the SL55 AMG in terms of perfromance, and considering its consistant poor perfromance in magazine tests (it was originally claimed to be a competitor to the BMW M3), I see the car as a wasted opertunity. Its more likely that the SL55 AMG you claim had a hard time overtaking the Volvo was driving with it's handbrake on, or that it was meerly a re-badged SL350  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
