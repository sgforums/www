            <div class='col-md body'>Viruses need to be inside cells to harm you; we get flu from one another by droplets (like when friends sneezes, you breathe in the droplets and get the flu). For those overseas who got bird flu, they're in close contact with the birds (ie chicken farmers) so they get exposed to a lot of this. Don't be overly worried about the whole birdshit thing, it doesn't really spread that way. But do clean it off fast as it  is acidic and can eat into your wax and then paint layer. I don't think the alcohol swabs might be good for the paint (it's 70% so pretty strong) but can use on windscreen...also get rid of juddering of  the wipers haha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not theory it's true! That's why in general we can't really treat viral infections, unlike bacteria which we can use antibiotics since they're too big to go into cells. Got to learn something from you, that bird shit has so much uric acid. Pisses me off when they shit on the car after it's waxed. Even after cleaning it off there's still a mark where it's eaten through the wax.</div>
