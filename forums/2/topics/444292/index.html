              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Even as the authorities look into the idea of 
              mechanised car parks, some analysts pointed out the challenges - such as
               maintenance and costs - with such a system. <br><br>Instead, they 
              suggested more innovative ideas, including creating a private market for
               parking spaces and allocating different zones for vehicles of different
               sizes. <br><br>National University of Singapore transport expert Lee 
              Der Horng noted that it is "very common" in some cities in the United 
              States to group cars of similar sizes together. <br><br>Said Associate 
              Professor Lee: "So the smaller cars are parked in the same zone, and 
              it's the same for the sports utility vehicles (SUVs), for instance."<br><br>Nanyang
               Technological University transport economist Michael Li has a more 
              radical suggestion: Allocate each household with a car park lot and 
              allow those who do not own any vehicles to "rent" out their lots to 
              others, thus creating a market which would enable demand and supply to 
              balance out. <br><br>According to the Ministry of National Development, 
              six in 10 Housing and Development Board (HDB) households do not own 
              cars. About a third own one car, while 5 per cent own two or more.<br><br>The transport analysts pointed out that the cheap HDB parking fees here would escalate the carpark crunch in the years to come. <br><br>In Taipei, for instance, motorists have to pay a flat fee of as much as S$200,000 for one parking lot, said Assoc Prof Lee. <br><br>He
               added that policymakers should think about a "market-based" solution - 
              in which parking fees will have to be higher - for housing estates that 
              face severe car park shortage. <br><br>Last Friday, National Development
               Minister Khaw Boon Wan wrote on his blog that, while new estates will 
              come with adequate car parks, new solutions are needed in the older HDB 
              estates "where there is little space to add new lots". <br><br>Mr Khaw 
              has asked the HDB to look into mechanised parking systems but he noted 
              there are "implementation issues" to be worked through. <br><br>HDB 
              residents who spoke to TODAY generally welcomed the idea - as long as 
              the system is thoroughly tested and properly maintained. <br><br>Some 
              suggested a policy which require residents to secure a parking lot 
              before they buy a vehicle - a suggestion mooted last year in this 
              newspaper in a column by consultant Richard Hartung.<br><br>Calling for a
               balloting system for HDB households who wish to own more than one car, 
              IT consultant Brandon Tan, 40, said: "HDB carparks are supposed to be 
              for the middle-class masses ... If people want a second or third car but
               fail to win the ballot, then they should look for alternative parking 
              solutions." - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a></span></p>
