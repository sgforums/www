              <p>Saw this in SHC:</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">"I guess this is the best place to post complaints since this is the "hub" of almost all car forum. So, I won't be posting in other car forums, so need all bro/sis help to spread the word to other car forums. Please do so to warn others before they end up like me. So this workshop, quite popular in a bad way is located in Yew Tee industrial park. The name ah... M* R*c*n*. <br><br>Basically, the main problem is them is they never anticipate problems one. All they do is take things for granted, just do do do, and just wait for things to happen then start to waste time to rectify it. Infact, after doing my car up with them, I find myself going back every week, yes, every f**king week to rectify small small problems. My guess is, all this is thanks to all the china men working there and I also think the main mechanic also never bother to check their work. Some examples, engine leaking oil after engine work, turbo leaking oil, turbo oil feed line not done properly, stock components not pyt back after being removed, and many many more. <br><br>Knowledge. I can tell you, the boss knows NOTHING. Their technical knowledge is one of the worst man! Don't believe, try calling them and asking, they will just smoke their way thru with you. I ask my friend help me call before and ask them some test questions, end up duno anything one, prices all any how quote. Imagine same product, on 2 different occasions (4 days apart) very different price one. <br><br>Wiring. Super-duper messy wiring, piggyback never hide in proper place, stock sensors kenna short circuited when installing piggyback, stock sensors going kaput prematurely, install gauges also cannot do properly, and these are just a few of the things only. Many more to mention. <br><br>Next, tuning. Would you let someone who boasts that he self-learn tuning by pianging a few engines to tune your car for you? Car was so not drivable after tuning, car jerking on highway, no smooth acceleration, and many many more. Oh yeah, did i mention they charge $100 less than $1k for tuning? If it was a tuner who learnt tuning from Australia or so, I maybe will pay that price, but then... oh F##K, you all know what I trying to say. <br><br>There are many many more problems to say, but I have my reasons for not saying them out. Those who wanna know and wish to discuss this with me privately, can PM me. Those who know which workshop I talking about, can also post your bad experiences here for everyone to see. Other bad reviews I heard about them, the RX-8 Defi gauges issue and some guy's car kenna caught by LTA with the mechanic driving it. <br><br>Right now, my poor little white car is suffering. Oil leak here and there, stock parts missing, infact, its one big f**king mess! I brought my car to another workshop.. and their comments... turbo oil feed line very badly done, a rubber fuel line which is almost going to bust is just running right next to the turbine.. yes the turbine side of the turbo, turbo mounted in a werid position with no supporting brackets and this other workshop say sooner or later something will crack from vibrations, basically the engine bay is in one huge big f**king mess!! <br><br>Lastly, from my views, one by one, their customers are all leaving them and sooner or later, its time to close down and say bye bye to their newly opened, big garage. <br><br>Mods if this post is not appropriate, please remove. <br><br>Thanks!"</span> <br><br><a href="http://www.shc-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=152635"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">http://www.shc-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=152635</span></span></a></p>
