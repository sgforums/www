Which car? Goddness... haven't you heard that Lexus is well known for its comfort and quietness? Of cos it's BETTER than European cars in sound insulation.<br><br>I may sound very ego-centric, heaping praises on the car that I just bought. Yup I admit - to a certain extent I am. But do go try the BMW and the Merc and the Jags and the Volvos or watever european car.

If yes, you are also saying that the Lotus = Toyota because it uses a Toyota Celica engine?<br><br>Just to let you know, I have tested both the Mark X and the IS250 and you can feel the diiference immediately when you sit inside the IS250. Totally plush and luxurious. The IS250 comes with better contoured seats, softer leather, MUCH better sound insulation, Vehicle Stability Control and Traction Control, paddle shifts, 13-speakers Pioneer sound system, air-conditioned seats at the front (WOW!) etc etc... And on top of that, great looking car with the powerful 'L' badge. So you'll know why you want to pay $30k more for the IS250, which I did.</div></blockquote>firstly i am not insunating anything... i am juz saying that mark x uses is250 engine... but it is a known fact that lexus is borne out of toyota...<br><br>plush and luxurious, better contoured seats, softer leather, great looking car, powerful L badge.... all is subjective<br><br>paddle shift even civic has it... what's so special....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>air conditioned seats at the front... u scared too hot ur balls over heat ah/???<br><br>13 speakers pioneer sound system... so sad ah.. buy car already no money to ask lexus for the mark levinson one ah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>VSC and TC...already available on lower end cars like camry nothing special.....<br><br>now i know what a cum gong kia u are... spending 30k extra solely to inflate and supersize ur ego.... and thinking u have made a good deal...<br><br>actually i do sympathise with u la... to need a lexus to boost ur ego... cos u have zero friends in friendster... 30 and still unattached... tsk tsk...<br><br>its veh saddening indeed....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
