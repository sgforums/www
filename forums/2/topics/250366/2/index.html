I am someone who sweat very easily, and when sitting in a car our backs are pressed against the seat (no air circulation). If I get into my car with my shirt being slightly damp from the wet, most probably it will remain damp after I get out of the car. Ventilated seats will definitely be a godsend to me, to be honest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks guys for all the information needed. Went to performance motor to test drive the BM 320, exterior view looks ok, but don't quite like the interior. good response, but not as good as lexus in terms of pick up. But i know there is still much more room to mod in the BM. Somemore, lots of BM on the road already, a bit common. but they did gave me a attractive package.<br><br>Went to C&amp;C, heard that new C class coming soon, so, no more C200, only 180... Don't quite like the C class as well, looks like driving my dad car more.<br><br>So, i think i going to buy IS liao, thanks guys!<br><br>The above are purely my views, no intention of war! peace!</div>

For the price of $130k, which BMW can you get? Yup the BMW 320. But BMW is 2 litres, 155bhp, torque less than 200nm, 0-100kmph in 9.7 secs. The killer thing is: a BLODDY 4-CYLINDER engine!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Also, tail-end model, Euro NCAP rating 4 stars. Lest you guys don't know: the Honda Civic 2.0 is more powerful than the BMW 320.<br><br>On the other hand, the IS250 is 2.5 litres, 205bhp, 252 nm torque, 0-100kmph in 8.2 secs (US website is 7.9 secs). Best part: extremely smooth V6 ENGINE! New model on the road, Euro NCAP rating 5 full stars! Also, bros please go see the 3-series' interior and compare that to the interior of the IS250. How to fight? IS250 is so full of gadgets over the 320 (yup I know, mine is just a humble Standard Version. But just the Standard version also win already).<br><br>Anyway, for those who are interested, even the BMW 323 doesn't match up to the IS250 in terms of specs - BMW 323 being a 177 bhp car, with slower pickup at 8.9 secs. And again, plain interior like the BMW 320. And the 323 is priced at $140k to $150k region!<br><br>So if you really want to compare price, compare the IS250 to the 2.5 litres BMW 325. Now that is a level-to-level comparison. But of cos la, my bet is BMW 325 is more zippy than the IS250 bcos BMW 325 is 218bhp in its extremely sweet in-line 6-pots engine. But again, interior comfort and quietness? Probably the IS250 again. And the BMW 325 is priced much more than the 323!<br><br>So please don't say that the Lexus is more expensive than the BMW. Bcos the entry-level of a Lexus is MUCH higher spec than the entry-level of the BMW.<br><br>2) Yup I do agree that the IS250 is pretty cramped, especially at the back. But the 3-series isn't any much better. Probably the C-class is more spacious. But hack la. For me, I am driving myself and my girl in more than 80% of the time that I am driving the car.<br><br>3) Hmm.. when it comes to badging, really very subjective and personal already. So I can't argue on that. Some people feel that drivng a badge is more important, however crap the car can be. My suggestion is: go for the car that makes you feel good. If you feel that the badge of a car makes you feel good, then go for it. For me, I chose the IS250 because the drive makes me feel good. You can imagine the smirk on my face everytime I see a BMW 323 or C-class on the road.

Out of 43 of them, 8 are from USA, 2 from Canada, 7 from Japan. Sure, it does not make up the majority (17/43). There are 15 Europeans, and the rest (11) of the jurors are from the rest of the world. Sounds fair, doesn't it? But you must look at which car each grp of people will vote for.<br><br>1. Japanese<br>Is there any doubt here? Unless you wanna play with the idea of them voting for the Suzuki.<br><br>2. North Americans<br>No American car is among the top 10 finalists. And they are fans of the Lexus all along.<br><br>3. Europeans<br>Now this is the tricky part. There are so many appealing Europeans products in the list (for e.g. TT, Q7, CL, C4 and the beautiful C6). Most probably the European votes are split among the different European contenders. The French will vote for the Citroens, the Germans..well who knows?<br><br>4. Rest of the world<br>I suspect most of them will go for the Lexus and the Europeans.<br><br>Overall conclusion? There are so many strong European contenders and just one strong Japanese contender. I believe the bros here are intelligent enough to understand the implications. And yes, some ppl may say that the jurors are supposed to be fair and objective. So the best car wins, right? Not necessarily, some jurors have admitted in the past that the COTY award is just an exercise in national pride.<br><br>Dun be mistaken, the LS which won this award is a masterpiece in its own right. let's not take anything away from such a good car. But we, as intelligent consumers, really need to take the advice from the so called experts with a pinch of salt. To me, this WCOTY award is just like the Champions League. Liverpool had won the title, and may win it again this year. But does it make it the best team in Europe? Obviously not.<br><br>The most impt COTY award is always your own COTY award. Buy something you appreciate, and not something the rest of the world seemingly loves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am truely surprised by the number of intelligent posts here in this thread; usually the bulk on sgforums are pretty much pointless and not worth responding to.<br><br>The new C Class is an absolute beauty; if you notice the way MB is moving, they are targeting the emerging market of young professionals.

Lexus on the other hand has been known to take care of all their customers. The reason why many lexus buyers very often return is because the perks of driving a Lexus are immense.<br><br>My parent used to drive a Lexus but changed to a luxury european manufacturer, not by choice, but simply because Lexus did not have a model that would fit in with what was needed in the car.<br><br>I guess you should list down (and prioritise) what you are seeking in a car to help make an informed decision that you will not regret.<br><br>Don't buy a Mark X simply because it's the most value for money feature wise. Owning a car is a luxury in Singapore, and if you are going to pamper yourself with one, you should obviously truely enjoy your purchase. Don't regret your buy and sell it 2 years down the road and absorb the bulk of the depreciation.<br><br>Note also the different warranty/service packages; Lexus is known to be slightly flexible on this and your agent can look after you there.</div>

For the price of $130k, which BMW can you get? Yup the BMW 320. But BMW is 2 litres, 155bhp, torque less than 200nm, 0-100kmph in 9.7 secs. The killer thing is: a BLODDY 4-CYLINDER engine!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Also, tail-end model, Euro NCAP rating 4 stars. Lest you guys don't know: the Honda Civic 2.0 is more powerful than the BMW 320.<br><br>On the other hand, the IS250 is 2.5 litres, 205bhp, 252 nm torque, 0-100kmph in 8.2 secs (US website is 7.9 secs). Best part: extremely smooth V6 ENGINE! New model on the road, Euro NCAP rating 5 full stars! Also, bros please go see the 3-series' interior and compare that to the interior of the IS250. How to fight? IS250 is so full of gadgets over the 320 (yup I know, mine is just a humble Standard Version. But just the Standard version also win already).<br><br>Anyway, for those who are interested, even the BMW 323 doesn't match up to the IS250 in terms of specs - BMW 323 being a 177 bhp car, with slower pickup at 8.9 secs. And again, plain interior like the BMW 320. And the 323 is priced at $140k to $150k region!<br><br>So if you really want to compare price, compare the IS250 to the 2.5 litres BMW 325. Now that is a level-to-level comparison. But of cos la, my bet is BMW 325 is more zippy than the IS250 bcos BMW 325 is 218bhp in its extremely sweet in-line 6-pots engine. But again, interior comfort and quietness? Probably the IS250 again. And the BMW 325 is priced much more than the 323!<br><br>So please don't say that the Lexus is more expensive than the BMW. Bcos the entry-level of a Lexus is MUCH higher spec than the entry-level of the BMW.<br><br>2) Yup I do agree that the IS250 is pretty cramped, especially at the back. But the 3-series isn't any much better. Probably the C-class is more spacious. But hack la. For me, I am driving myself and my girl in more than 80% of the time that I am driving the car.<br><br>3) Hmm.. when it comes to badging, really very subjective and personal already. So I can't argue on that. Some people feel that drivng a badge is more important, however crap the car can be. My suggestion is: go for the car that makes you feel good. If you feel that the badge of a car makes you feel good, then go for it. For me, I chose the IS250 because the drive makes me feel good. You can imagine the smirk on my face everytime I see a BMW 323 or C-class on the road. Smokin time!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div></blockquote>1) If you want a fast car buy an evo or wrx with the money u used for IS250! and yes. 325 is comparable to IS250. In my opinion, 323 and 320 are for people buying the badge rather than the car. But this what branding can do. bring the emotions.<br><br>3) Why smoked someone that is obviusly slower than you. You would want want someone in a marx X to smoke you or rather u cant outsmoke since both sld be abt the same. Like in yr case, there are reason why u chose is250 over mark x but there are reason why poeple chose bmw 3 over is250.</div>

Just that in my opinion, I feel that 323 owners and C-class owners had paid much more for a drive that is not deserving for their price, and a much lower spec than the IS250.
