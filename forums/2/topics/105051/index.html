            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering why some drivers still go for COE cars even though the new cars with 10 full yr COE are relatively quite cheap as compared to last time. I have checked thru and find that one Honda ESI/LSI or Toyota corolla or Nissan Presea would cost about 20k to 30k plus and the COE is only 6.5 to 7 yrs. A new toyota vios, Mitshubishi Lancer, Nissan sunny would cost about 50k to 60k plus and they are new!!! so relatively maintenance free for the first 2 to 3 yrs....can anyone share your view??? Thanks[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have done alot of research on this cos i wanna buy a car too. conclusion:<br><br>1) do NOT ever buy COE cars. unless u know the owner personally. the maintainence will be sky high. and stay away from cars which have 3 owners and above. and never buy from dealers who advert 10-18K for the car in the newspapers.<br><br>2) PARF cars. monthly installment is same as new cars. just that u lose a lot less if u suddenly decide to sell your car. pre 02 cars are lagi worth it. as above, stay away from cars which had 3 owners or more.<br><br>3) NEW cars. the most shiok of them all cos its brand new and u r the 1st owner. everything is good and under warranty. now for the bad news, the moment u turn the ignition, u will have lost 5-10K minimum. cant sell the car anytime soon unless u wanna lose big. break even around 4-5yrs if u loan 10 yrs.<br><br>overgeneralisation? perhaps. but hope this little bit of info helps. anybody have any comments or corrections to make, kindly post away!!<br><br>cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah thats why. if you have the $$ to buy mods might as well get a new car. but some pple love to mod la so the older civics are best. but if u buy the older civics u muz be experienced and know wat to do regarding everything. and surely most are modded b4 and if the mods are of lousy quality u are dead. muz change everything. sir nice la but for that price can get a brand new car leh. depends on individual's preference one. the esi also nice, but heard is super problematic. so i will still prefer to buy a new car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bro Joe_Legal is rite..<br><br>Nowadays cars more relak then the past.. even the supercars got stricter emission standards etc... so in some ways, stock to stock, are less powerful than the cars of the past.<br><br>Old cars problematic is one thing, but there are quite a number of Civics fully re-furbished. Interior done up swee swee, brake system upgraded from pump to rotor, distributor changed, alternator changed, engine modded so is rebuilt from bottom up wif new (and sometimes forged) parts, gearbox rebuilt, new drive shafts, new suspension, new timing belt + all other belts.. so if u take over from them, very little problem.<br><br>Mebe air-con is one thing tat mite be shoddy, and old rubber linings.<br><br>My fren bot COE RX-7 for $100k tho got many new cars he can buy, but it was a nitemare and broke down quite often. So put up for sale within 2 weeks.<br><br>So depending on wat ur purpose is... if u always wanted to own a power car but cant afford it new, COE car is a good chance to own one. But comes wif the maintenance issue la.</div>
