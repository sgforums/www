            <div class='col-md body'>Driving to Europe is physically possible, but the main difficulty is getting across to Europe. There are a few unfriendly countries from Thailand onwards which makes this journey difficult, politically. Road condition may be lousy too.

Been to Betong in Thailand though.<br><br>3 countries borders Thailand up north - Burma, Laos and Cambodia - none of which are friendly to people entering their country. You can forget about Burma, only accompanied tourist are allowed. Laos is equally bad if I remember correctly. Cambodia might be a possible route, then you will have to pass through Vietnam followed by China.<br><br>China onwards, things may get wilder, possible routes are Kazakhstan, Kyroyzstan, Talistan, Pakistan - none of which are friendly. Bandits are not uncommon in those places I  heard. Best bet might be Pakistan, but it leads to either Afghanistan or Iran. Neither of which is a country you would want to pass through. But then, no matter which route you choose, you have to eventually pass through either Russia or Iran. If you can survive that far, the rest of the journey would be peanuts.<br><br>Essentially, the problems are<br>(1) Getting a visa to enter a number of the countries enroute<br>(2) Some countries are highly unsafe with bandits along the way<br><br>Those are the main two. Of course there are others, but I think the rest are minor compared to the above two.</div>

Muslims in Southern Thailand had a few clashes with the government troop over there recently. And if I remember correctly, it is still under military curfew at the moment - meaning no move about after a certain time. Under this kind of circumstances, you can expect your vehicle will be highly unsafe if it is not parked in enclosed area.</div>

Because if they allow you to drive through, then it may not matter much if it takes one or two days to them. The big issue is between allow and not allow.<br><br>When I say accompanied tourist, I mean a tour group organized by the goverment of Burma, staying in places where they want to stay (with a considerable $$$) and going where they want you to go. Don't expect to be allow to move around freely and in any direction that you want. As far as I am aware of, there are still resistance to the burmese government in some parts of the country and I bet they do not care about any government rules or regulations.<br><br>For the vehicle part, you got to ask other people. I am not aware of any speed limiter on cars.<br><br>Also, a few years back, there was a Singaporean couple who made a cycling trip from Singapore to Europe (or the other way round, I forgot). I believe they have valuable experience to share. You might want to find a way to contact them. I remember there was even a dedicated website for them back then. I do believe one of the reason why they choose bicycle is exactly because that is easier to get approvel to enter different countries than a car. And from the sound of it, you are thinking of using a good car. In that case, I will bet that it will be lost or confiscated in a short time.</div>
