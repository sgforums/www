              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p>i am looking for a sports coupe to appear in several scenes in an upcoming non-profitable short film by an independent film crew.</p>
              <p>we will welcome the owner to partake in the production as
              a stunt driver as well, as most of our crew do not have driving
              licenses.</p>
              <p>what we are looking for is very simple:</p>
              <p>- 2 door closed-roof coupe, something along the lines of the Toyota MR2, Nissan 350Z, Toyota Celica or similar looking.</p>
              <p>- no specific brand or make.</p>
              <p>- no decals or multi-coloured schemes. one single colour with a gloss finish is what we are looking for.</p>
              <p>- black, white or silver is preferred, but other colours welcome as well.</p>
              <p>- available at night on Saturdays (along with 1 day scene)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we will welcome the owner to partake in the production as a stunt driver as well, as most of our crew do not have driving licenses.</p>
              <p>there will be no remuneration but we may be able to provide for items like petrol costs, etc.</p>
              <p>please contact me at basil@tokuasia.com and we can further discuss the details.</p>

              <p>Hey, u are the producer? U sounds unprepared.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First of all, what makes u think people with driver's license is qualified to perform the stunt that you want?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did u even apply for permission to perform the stunt in the first place?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Doing stunt with a car without permission is equal to dangerous driving in the eyes of the law.</p>

              <p>i didn't say there would be any stunts involved. there won't. having a 'stunt driver' does not mean i will need any vehicular stunts involved in the production.</p>
              <p>it will be something like Miami Vice. the vehicle is used mostly for imagery purposes only.</p>
              <p><br>secondly, with regards to permissions, i don't think i owe you any answer as i have already corresponded with the proper authorities, unless you are interested in helping out.</p>
              <p>cheers.</p>

              <p>i'm 20 and almost a civil servant. my crew ranges from 18 year olds to early/mid-20s. our oldest is 34 year old who is colour blind and so can't drive.</p>
              <p>out of all, we only have 3 people who can drive, and all are half a p-plate.</p>
              <p>so, yeah. =)</p>

              <p>Honestly the offer isn't attractive at all. As said earlier, what if the car gets damaged during the filming? Any insurance to cover the stunt? What if the stunt driver (whoever it may be) gets injured? And worst of all, there's no renumeration.</p>
              <p>I'm sure many of us can understand your plight that your film is not a profit-driven one but sadly, there's no such thing as a free lunch. It is very unlikely that a suitable person will volunteer unless he/she is your close friend or something.</p>

              <p>I seriously doubt u found anyone. Its more likely u changed the script or forked out money to rent a car or borrowed a cheaper car.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have nothing against you but I cant help but to doubt u can find a volunteer who is willing to lend out his/her car and considering the type of car u need is not cheap to begin with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And what would he/she stands to gain anyway? These people who drove such cars are most likely to be busy people who wont have time for u.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, just prove me wrong if I am really wrong about you. But, U dont own me any explanation or answer too. Its all in you.</p>
