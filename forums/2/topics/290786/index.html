If it is for family purpose, because of convenience sake, I suggest move house with better location better.  If it is for work, make sure your work compensate you for the car use, e.g. maintenance, fuel, parking, etc, if not, change to a job that does. Always remember, your house is an asset, a car is a sunken cost.</div>

How far you think you can coast to the traffic light w/o applying much brakes or gas, anticipate what the car in front of you is gonna do, how much gas to apply just to get the car moving, dadada... if you have driven your car long enuff, you should be able to discover what's the best efficiency you can achieve.</div>

Like getting lost and circling the destination. Looking/waiting for parking space is also not productive. Parking in the upper decks of MSCP daily adds to the milage and FC, and you're going nowhere.<br>A 10Km congestion-free route that takes 15 minutes, consumes less fuel than a 7Km congested route, that takes 25-30 minutes.<br></div>
