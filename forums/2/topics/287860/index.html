            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I have a question here, not sure if anyone can help me.<br><br>In Feb, I got into an accident in CTE. the situation that was that there was<br>heavy traffic clear skies. I was at the right most lane filtering right.<br>Trafic condition was about at a stand still, and I proceed to filter right when the cars started going forward.<br><br>Not alert enough, I didn't the car in front didn't move forward enough as I was looking at the left side mirror, so I bumped into the car in front. Speed was about 20-30km/h then.<br><br>The driver came out, very agressive, scolded vulgar language. Started demanding for my IC and all the stuff, insurance, etc. Stupidly I gave him.<br>His passenger, I assume his GF, came out too, busy calling her "brother-in-law", asking him how to best deal with me to claim damages.<br><br>Since I had insurance and it's just bumper, I gave him everything he wanted. He took photo, drew on a note book the cars' position and I even signed on the notebook.<br><br>Basically, main point is, the accident was minor, I got my Nissan Latio bumper repaired for $180 and filed an insurance report within 2-3 days. Till one day in April I received a police letter asking me to go to the police station for investigation. Apparently, he went to make a police report stating he received injuries. So after I made the police report stating no one was injured, I thought everything was fine. Non of the 4 passengers in my car had any injury, or was even affected in any way.<br><br>No, more trouble came, in end May, I received another police letter charging me fro negligent driving, fining me $200 and 6 demerit points. Having a little knowledge of law, I know law is not about justice, so tough luck. I paid.<br><br>The worse is in June, I received a lawyers letteraddressed to the insurance company, CCed to me. The guy is claiming $3.5k on damages to the car, a Toyota Vios. Well, I know pple do that, overhauling the whole car since they can get my insurance to pay. By the way, it was just a dent on his bumper. Worst, his passenger, who was well at that time claimed $25K for whiplash injury, cost of future care, loss of income, etc. The letter stated that if the insurance company refused to respond the lawyers will file legal proceedings against me.<br><br>That is over, I guess the insurance company paid as I ignored the letter on advice of my insurance agent that the insurance will deal with it. In August another letter came cliaming the same amount S$30K for the driver's injuries! And they are filing legal proceedings! I got a Writ of Summons! WTF. I just made a small mistake and bumped his bumper!<br><br>My question is will I be forced to pay $30K. This is ridiculous, really stressed out. Does Singapore traffic law protect innocent drivers from these sort of exorbitant claims</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You should keep some pics of the damage.<br><br>For such minor damage such as bumper which involve 20-30km/h, its consider minor.<br><br>Since now is already coming november, get your insurance company tostep in and keep bugging them. getting a laywer by yourself would have cost much more.<br><br>The 3.5k repair is too much. He could have work together with the car repair shop to eat more $. Or you may have given him free addtional body kits.<br><br>Get them to show the damage list and get your insurance company to review it.<br><br>Judging by how you say of the damage, seems like only bumper got hit,<br>That type of incident I do not believe will include the need to change the car boot with it.<br><br>Worst come to worst, pay thru you insurace company, at the most is pay the excess. 3.5k damage if I remember correctly, affect 10 - 20% NCD but no need to top up addtional as below 10k claim.<br><br>You should have stated to pay for the repair at your prefered workshop coz at the end of the day, you hit his rear bumper, and its gonna be 90% your fault.<br>If you had gone thru this method, will cost you less than 600 for bumper and paint unless that guy is driving a mercs or higher end luxury car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it could be that the guy took advantage of you. you see, the fact that you hit him from behind obviously puts you in a tough spot.<br><br>but i think, the main problem is because he claimed to have injuries.<br><br>under normal circumstances, like the point you described [when nobody is injured], police will not investigate. however, if the guy decides to go seek medical treatment for any 'pain', even if it is days after the day of accident, the non-injury accident becomes an accident with injury. in this case, all he needs to do is lodge an accident report and police will investigate. i believe this is what happened, and how you got penalised by the police. whether or not he is really injured is another matter altogether, for it is up to the doctor to decide if any injuries he sustained subsequently is a direct result of the accident. i know for a fact because some people will die die claim to the doctor that they feel 'pain' even when there is nothing, just so that they can fulfil the criteria to lodge an accident report. worst thing is, they usually get what they want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>about the claims made against you... well, you're really unfortunate. this guy sounds like a total scumbag: get you into trouble and now wants to fleece you. i think really no choice. you might have to contest his claim in court.<br><br>all the best. hopefully the case turns out in your favour. do keep us all posted. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wish u goodluck. As much as its pretty well seen as a scumbag taking advantage of the accident, i hope the judges(if it does become a lawsuit) have good and wise judgement to tell right from wrong.<br><br>A large amount of money is involved here. get the best lawyer and counter-sue back for fraud on injuries. launch full medical check ups on him. Maybe he has mental problems, launch full mental check ups. if it does work, you might be actually getting money at the end even after paying for all the services.<br><br>And hopefully, teach that scumbag a lesson. And omg..20-30km/h also will hurt meh? maybe u can even tell the judge that they werent wearing seatbelts. Heex.</div>
