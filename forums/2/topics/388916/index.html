              A story of an affair with a married man in car trade.
              
              Abt two years ago, i met a man name william on msn using the id of leonong. We chat online almost everyday and feelings for him grew. Realised that he was married but things still happened. This man had been calling me a lot of things abt his work, his family and how he felt. (pm me if anyone interested to see the conversations of us in msn as i do save a copy)
              
              At times he would keep me accompanied on late evening and saturday afternoon before his wife Dawn found out.
              
              We had a lot of good memories in the result became hurt. I had plans and dreams in life before i met this man but he ruined it indirectly. They had two children who currently studying in a school located at serangoon north ave 4.
              
              Things started to changed when i got my first pregancy with him which happened in october 2008. He did nothing for me that time. Even i insisted keeping the baby but finally managed to listened to his sugar coated words and aborted it. William did not accompanied me to the clinic but he went for a golf game with his friends. I was very disappointed and angry with him as he went avoiding me.
              
              Two months later, he contacted me and we got hooked up again. On that time was my worst time in my life as my dad was seriously ill. He came with a sincere concern to me. 
              
              Another two months, later my dad passed away which he was the closest to me in the family. The lost of both next of kin in 4 months wasn't easy for me to cope. But when william called with concern really made me stronger to face the reality.
              
              All this doesn't last long when i found out i'm pregant again with his child. This time i insisted to keep the child. He was very pissed of with me and left me. I were so lost and left singapore to perth and work. Life in perth was slow but was not prefect for my emotions. I went into depression stage during my 7th pregnancy after william had left me waiting for his call overnight. I am lucky to have a branch of supportive friends who flew in and check on me.
              
              Leon Tay, my son was finally born in perth. I went through his citizenship in singapore and australia alone. I contacted william but he refused to allow his name to be listed in leon's birth cert as he claimed that by doing this way his life will be very bad.
              
              At first, i agreed as long as he do what a father should do for leon. Now he went avoiding again. 
              
              Last week i called his office in yio chu kang, Dawn answered she claimed that she do not want to know what is going on between me and william. And i told her that i want to find william as he is not answering his mobile phone. 
              
              William finally answered but was scolding me very angryily. If he is what he claimed that my son Leon is not his, then why he doesn't want to go for a DNA test? Or is it because Dawn doesn't allow him to go? I don't understand.
              
              I fully understand that going through court can force him to admit but with my peanuts pay i can't afford a lawyer. Now william hide like a mouse and dawn pretends to be an ostrich that hides her head in the ground. 
              
              An adult should face the consequents of the beings and be responsible for Leon.
              
              Now his company is going down, william kept saying it is his last chance but if god really have eyes then he should answer my prayers.
              
              I sincerely hope those who read this teach william what a man should and not to aviod his responsibility as a father to my son Leon.

              <p>I don't know why no one replied to you but I will. The big big problem here is that you are messing around with a married man and you should know that this kind of relationships will never blossom. Funny thing is , you know that he was married and has a family already but yet you still wana jump into this shit hole .</p>
              <p> I cant blame you for that too , love is blind so are you. He is just trying to sugar coat everything to you just to please his little "pee pee" . Well , if you have his address and his phone number . I belive you should know how to find him :&gt;</p>

              well said storywolf.
              In this case you claimed I'm down right shameful. Then why did a man that cheat his family and the woman that slept with him every night isn't it a bastard? Why is such cases women were name at bitch? Somehow i felt that you know him.
              
              Very simple question to throw out, sperms came from him and made my son out and it takes 2 hands to clap. Do i have to drug him to go bed with me or do i forced him to insert his sperms in me. Now he's the father of my son and trying to avoid and hide. So is that means that men nowadays fond of doing something like that?
              
              Make a woman pregnant and just pat pat the backside and pretends nothing happen? For those who did that, dun forget if u have a daughter. Words cannot say too early.
              
              At least i dare to stand up and say it louder no matter what it cost... Naga Motor.. Mr William Ong U-Leon is the father of my son Leon Tay Yu Leong.
              
              Go and ask William Ong do he had the god damn guts to do it. I threw myself to him? Do you need me to post all the msn conversations out here and see? Call me shameful!! By all means, i'm just doing something right for myself and my child...
              
              You better pray yr daughter dun fall into the same suitation like mine and let's see how she handle...

              2cansam - i fully understand when the truth were indeed hurting. But at least i'm facing it then avoiding it like he do. Even the whole world doesn't support what i did now but at least i did my best as a mother to my boy. Not just letting the asshole off so easily. 
              
              Rockstar - yes indeed live by the sword then killed by the sword but this phase don't apply on me. I will make sure i use the sword and kill others before it kills me. Using the sword which i live by and fight.

              <p>well said storywolf.<br>In this case you claimed I’m down right shameful. Then why did a man that cheat his family and the woman that slept with him every night isn’t it a bastard? Why is such cases women were name at bitch? Somehow i felt that you know him.</p>
              <p>Very simple question to throw out, sperms came from him and made my son out and it takes 2 hands to clap. Do i have to drug him to go bed with me or do i forced him to insert his sperms in me. Now he’s the father of my son and trying to avoid and hide. So is that means that men nowadays fond of doing something like that?</p>
              <p>Make a woman pregnant and just pat pat the backside and pretends nothing happen? For those who did that, dun forget if u have a daughter. Words cannot say too early.</p>
              <p>At least i dare to stand up and say it louder no matter what it cost… Naga Motor.. Mr William Ong U-Leon is the father of my son Leon Tay Yu Leong.</p>
              <p>Go and ask William Ong do he had the god damn guts to do it. I threw myself to him? Do you need me to post all the msn conversations out here and see? Call me shameful!! By all means, i’m just doing something right for myself and my child…</p>
              <p>You better pray yr daughter dun fall into the same suitation like mine and let’s see how she handle…</p>

              From your posting and replies I really worried your hate for that man will be vent on your son.
              
              You loved a man whom u know cannot take care of you for life.
              You thought he will leave his wife for you.
              You gave birth to a child thinking it will soften him up.
              Now you go around spreading hate and wanted revenge.
              You are basically every man's nightmare and a very selfish woman.
              You never consider others' feelings and think in life everything is about you.
              
              I hope you hold responsible for your son and start focusing on loving him [your son] then wasting time hating that man.
              
              Becos legally you can't do anything about it.
              
              And why this is in CAR forum? Shouldn't it be moved to Aunt Agony? lol

              this is something wrong. To me giving birth a child to make him soft doesn't come into my mind. And it never come across my mind that he will divorce his wife too. They should pray harder that their daughter don't end up the same suitation as mine. What come around goes around.
              
              Why should i think of his so call family when he didn't even think of us. His family is not related to me at all and why should i give a damn on it. If william ong u-leon will have handle this issue at the first all this things would not had happened.
              
              It is for sure that i will love and give whatever i can for my son as i'm unlike his daddy. An useless chap!!
              
              Why is this in sgcars but not in aunt agony is because i want everyone to know who is Leon's daddy despite his daddy is hiding under dawn lim's skirt by avoiding.
              
              William Ong U-Leon of Naga Motor had been running away from responsibilty towards Leon Tay. 
              
              That is a husband that Dawn Lim had. Yes I hate William Ong. From that day I came back from Perth I told myself that I will not show any mercy to him. no matter how it gotta hurt me or others. But at least I'm facing it and not running away. And this is me.... A nightmare to every man if the man do not know how to handle me.

              <p>seriously i think you are a very self fish person. he didn't lie to you about his family, and both of you are adults, even if he got you pregnant, the only responsibility he had was to pay for your abortion. When you got pregnant he told you that he did not want the child and you insisted in keeping it, since you insisted you should be raising the child on your own. he never promised you any thing(like he would take care of the baby). this is a mature relationship between two adult, he didn't lie to you or cheated you. you are the one who can't face the reality.</p>

              mymoja - you said I'm selfish, what abt him. On the first abortion the only words he said was " abort it" and left me out there handle on my own. So this is what you agree that he's right? With the first abortion case and got me pregnant again and you claimed that is not his responsible to take care of my son. For your info, on my first abortion, i paid for all the costs and fees and he went hiding. And second pregnancy, I paid for all my boy expenses including hospitalization charges and what had he done. Last month in late december, he claimed that he wanted to get a christmas present for my boy and what had he done? Nothing at all.. He had done nothing at all. Who is more selfish? 
              
              In here everyone may call me all sorts of names but who really know what is going on? Actions is louder than words, when he uses words claiming that he's sorry, he wanted to do this and that but it's seems never valid.
              
              Till today, he dun have the freaking guts to stand in fornt of me to give a sincere sorry. All this turn out to be I'm selfish. With all this things going on, who have the ball rolling first? Then can I said that this became a culture and habit of a man now?

              <p>i agree that he is a lousy man, but if he took you to a hospital and paid for your abortion(for every time that you were pregnant). will it solve the problem, will you be happy? i think your problem lies on you are hoping that he will take care of you and the child. but it was clear that he didn't want the child. so keeping the child is your sole decision, so when you decide to keep the baby, you should be prepared to take good care of the child. The child will be better off without a lousy father. and TS did he ever promised that he would leave his wife and be with you? if not, den he is just having fun with you, and you were willing too. if he lied and said that he will leave his wife and marry you, and he asked you to keep the baby.... then i will agree with you.... TS you cannot make him the only sinner, you are partly responsible too. If you are sure that he will not take care of the child and you have no means of doing it, it is a very irresponsible act to keep the baby. and you are not a teenager or a ignorant young teen, you should know that raising a child is not a laughing matters, alot of couples got married when the girl is pregnant, but wat is the result? divorce in a few years? i have seen too many of these cases. I just wanna say since the baby is born, just take care of good care of him....forcing the father,will not change the fact that he doesn't want the child. as for the <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">culture and habit of a man, i agree that alot of man is fooling around, but i think they know the important of family. they are just playing around, eventually they will go back to their wife. if you cant take it, you shouldn't join the game</span></p>

              I think in this modern age and time, there is no excuse a fully growth woman don't know how to protect themselves from getting PREGENT. Are u a teenage girl?

              wait.. I dun find myself poor thing cos i got the ability to take care of my son. My main intention is to let everyone knows about this including william ong's family members. With him or without doesn't seems any diff to me. I wanted to see how his family react when they get to know this including his children.
              
              Such a lousy father can go how far. He have not realised that the worst yet to come. Count himself lucky that am out station now. Imagine the pressure come from his family members and his in laws during chinese new year.
              
              I had already prepared for the worst and prepared to fight this in court if he have his balls to walk in there allowing my son to claim his every right.
              
              I didn't own him a single thing at all. What is love.. The love to him had already dead when he left me waiting for his calls in perth.
              
              Am not a prefect person but at least whatever i did i dare to admit it. There's no right or wrong but yet the most simple things people tends to make it complicated. Why not asking around why i behaved this way while am not like that 2 years back.
              
              Am not an unreasonable person knowing that we cannot sort this out and proposed to talk with the presence of a lawyer. What had i done wrong? Get william ong to show what a man really can do and bring his balls out.
              
              Only in court, there's judgement. Men that put yrself in his shoes what will you guys do? No matter how unwilling you are, at least an proper apology to a woman who went through this thing in face.
              
              I bet you that william ong dun have the guts to do it. Am alone fighting for my deserved apology but not empty promises. At least i find myself worthwhile in market as a manager in huge MNC but why do i react this way where i dun do it at work. All this i fought for myself without any help. No doubt the child i want to keep it, why not ask a woman why do they want to keep a child knowing what is the outcome.
              
              The hate of him, is not that he's not able to take care of us but just he did not do what he should. If from the start he had handle it well then there won't be a me here creating all these posting.
              
              Am not here to want others to pity me, cos it's not going to serve me any good. Yes most of you may laugh like a joke but it is not easy to hate someone that deep. I just want to get what i deserve from him. All this things i will settle with him face to face when i return from my outstation.

              <p>wait.. I dun find myself poor thing cos i got the ability to take care of my son. My main intention is to let everyone knows about this including william ong’s family members. With him or without doesn’t seems any diff to me. I wanted to see how his family react when they get to know this including his children.</p>
              <p>Such a lousy father can go how far. He have not realised that the worst yet to come. Count himself lucky that am out station now. Imagine the pressure come from his family members and his in laws during chinese new year.</p>
              <p>I had already prepared for the worst and prepared to fight this in court if he have his balls to walk in there allowing my son to claim his every right.</p>
              <p>I didn’t own him a single thing at all. What is love.. The love to him had already dead when he left me waiting for his calls in perth.</p>

              <p>I'd usually refrain from making comments on issues like this but some things I think TS should bear in mind.</p>
              <p>You can't do anything to William. The women's charter does not apply to you simply because you were not married. Your kid however, does have an advantage in the sense that your kid applies under Chapter 353 part VII n68, Duty of Parents to maintain children, your kid might be entitled to some form of maintanence. You, however, do not apply because under n69 and n113, you'd have to be legally married to be entitled to anything (which you are not). Even if the court does grant anything to your son, it will probably be little more than peanuts as the court will take his current family situation into account during the assessment of maintanence (his legal wife and kids.)</p>
              <p>Even if he passes away intestate (which I believe will not happen anytime soon), you and your son will be entitled to nothing as the law does not make provision for illegitimate children.</p>
              <p>Darkseed is right.</p>
              <p>"</p>
              <p>From your posting and replies I really worried your hate for that man will be vent on your son.</p>
              <p>You loved a man whom u know cannot take care of you for life.<br>You thought he will leave his wife for you.<br>You gave birth to a child thinking it will soften him up.<br>Now you go around spreading hate and wanted revenge.<br>You are basically every man’s nightmare and a very selfish woman.<br>You never consider others’ feelings and think in life everything is about you."</p>

              <p>In addition, I find the comment you made about</p>
              <p>"You better pray yr daughter dun fall into the same suitation like mine and let’s see how she handle…"</p>
              <p>to be extremely distasteful. Just because you landed yourself into this situation, does not give you the right to come into this forum and curse the other forumners. Even if one day my daughter does get into a similar situation, the best thing I can do as a father is to accept it as her lot in life and try my best to make sure that my grandchild gets the best she can, and for my daughter to let go of her hate.</p>
              <p>Because I AM willing to bet my balls that while you simmer in your anger and hatred everyday thinking of William, he will be happily enjoying his life with his wife and his kids. Do not think too highly of yourself or your kid - because William won't.</p>
