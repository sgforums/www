            <div class='col-md body'>I fully agree that there are too many drivers with the bad habit of hogging the overtaking lane.<br><br>Just  the other day, when I was rushing to Changi Airport to pick up a guest, this NTUC taxi driver was deliberately and conciously blocking my way after which I flashed him move him out of the overtaking lane and this action further encouraged him to block my way all the way from Paya Lebar to the Tampines cutoff.<br><br>Sometimes, it is not taxi drivers but people who do not know that the lane is for overtaking and not keeping to the 90 speed limit.<br><br>I think we need to educate these drivers.</div>
