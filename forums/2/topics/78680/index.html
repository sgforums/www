            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you for all your advises.  I also think it is very wrong.  Gone back to the distributor and they advised me that I have to run in the car up to 10,000km before the fuel consumption can improve.  In fact, I was told by them that 9.5 km/litre is normal for the car, and they said that the specification in their brochures (which stated up to 14 km/lit) is based on some test conditions e.g. no air-cond, 14" tires, one person etc etc..  All kinds of conditions.  But I asked them, how can neber tell me about these conditions when I was deciding on the car, in fact, the salesperson re-affirm me the figures on the specs.<br><br>I am now at about 7000km, and will be monitoring closely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also learnt that we should look at fuel consumption spec. with the right perspective. Usually what is claimed is under certain (optimised?) conditions. If you are driving in the cities, ha, you've got to pay more for fuel. Worse if your car is heavier, or a petrol-drinker.</div>
