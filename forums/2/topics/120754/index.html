I see the night package as one that allows you to hold the car longest for the cheapest price... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>For me, car sharing not really suitable as I am rather heavy user. IMO, if I rent a car and not drive it whenever I can, then it is a waste right? Rent a car and park it in the carpark? Quote one example, that time need to go airport to pick my mum up, stay in jurong, got the night package, wah lao, the total cost I paid was like $60 plus for one night including mileage (total: 100+ km) of $30 plus.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>I was thinking, like that I rent a car for the WHOLE day for $60, add $20 for petrol, I can use the car for the whole day + I can travel anywhere I want without worrying for accelerated increase in cost.<br><br>By the way, did some calculations, $0.40 per km that car sharing company charge is very expensive. On rental, petrol cost average out is betwen $0.10 to $0.20 per km, with you being able to control - light footness and light load, you probably pay lesser, whereas you can't control km, one km travelled is one km travelled, no matter slow or fast, so I usually pick the latter... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

Excess is $1000, means that for the 1st $1000 damage you have to bear the repair cost, insurance will not pay.<br>Insurance will only cover and applicable if damage is more than $1000. For instance, damage cost $3000, insurance pay $2000, you pay $1000.</div>
