              <p>Hi brothers and sisters, if any one is seeing this post about this car agent at Sin Ming Drive, beware! Do not even step inside this showroom as the agents and the boss are unscrupulous.  </p>
              <p>To back up my statement, I had a terrible encounter last sunday 12 Sept 2010. I chanced upon from my friend that he had bought a Fiat Bravo with good service and is willing to take his old car without any penalty (amount owed to bank on prior ownership of existing vehicle). As I looking to lower my household expenses, my wife and I wanted to trade both our cars and in turn get a new one. By doing this is to lower our expenses and both of us will share the car. We went into this showroom with a "look look see see" attitude. The boss came up and tell us the benefits of the car and show us the car abouts. Later on, the salegirl came up and tried to bring the price tag to us (with hard selling and persuasion). Without any explanation, she asked for my I/C and credit card.</p>
              <p>I asked her why I need to pass my credit card to her. She said its for backup. Without my knowledge, she swiped my card, amounting to 3,000 dollars. As my credit card did not have much credit, the credit company called. I immediately asked the salesgirl why she swiped my card for a 3K transaction. She said she did it to safeguard in case I will to do any damage during the test drive. I approved to increase my limit.</p>
              <p>We went out to test drive, and back to the showroom without causing any damage to any car. The salesgirl then proceed on to pass me the loan form and ask me to sign on the dotted line. However, I decided not to fo forward with the deal. She changed her attitude and tell us that we have wasted her time and have made her lose a potential customer. I asked for a void on the 3K transaction that she did. She said she cannot and do not know how to void the transaction. I pressed on for her to void the transaction but she just kept standing there and do nothing to help. I give a call to the credit card company to see if they can help. They have informed me to put this 3K transaction on dispute and the investigation team will proceed to check.</p>
              <p>After the teleconversation, I still go up to the salesgirl to ask for the voidance of the transaction. She informed me that I have to forfeit my 3K. I was mad, and I didn't want to make a scene there. I left after knowing that the credit card company has taken note of this.</p>
              <p>Days later, the credit card company informed me that TTS Eurocars has claimed this amount from me. I have to raised a dispute form for the investigation team to follow up. I have went to Police to make a report after which they turn me to CASE. CASE will wait for my credit card company conclusion and if anything goes awry, I have to go down to CASE to follow up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, I not making false accusations here and I am not smearing this company. But please, beware if you are going to get a car from this showroom! Customer service is not there, and they are just hard selling the cars. Once turned down their offer, you will see their true colours.</p>
              <p>Apart from these, anyone who has anymroe idea whether I can void this transaction or get a refund? Anyone is a lawyer or anyone who can give me good advice on the percentage of me getting the money back? Really appreciate the help here, if any.</p>
              <p>Thank you and may GOD bless.</p>

              <p>IT IS CLEARLY A CASE OF CHEATING  BY CAR DEALERSHIP.</p>
              <p>INSTANT POLICE CASE.</p>
              <p>a car is really nothing ....just another bicycle or laptop computer.no one on this planet ever charges potential buyer just to test drive a car.its only a car and not a jet plane so they shouldnt charge $3k for a test drive. and their excuse of another loss customer con story is a fat lie.would never give anyone  $$$$ even for a test drive....would never hand over a credit card either....as long as u dun sign for it its ok...but yer number and particulars are already compromised.would simply throw the card away n report it as lost.</p>
              <p>they cant force u to buy a car that u dun like.....like going to macdonalds n they give u a cheeseburger even if u wanted a quarter pounder burger.</p>
              <p>since the police are helpless as usual to take any case...then case will be only solution.</p>

              <p>We are shocked and disturbed to read on this forum the misinformation and inaccuracy of the recent postings on this incident and the aspersions cast on us. It seems to us that the page is written by a couple who had entered our showroom on Sunday, 12 September 2010. To set the record straight, the company has at all times been willing to void the credit card transaction. The sales executive had merely explained that she was unable to do so immediately. We would set out below the correct version of events:-</p>
              <p>1. This couple was introduced by one of our Bravo customers. They walked into the showroom and was served by one of our sales executives. They went through the specifications of the Bravo for about 45 mins and information relating to the car was clearly explained to them, after which, they sat down and went through the trade-in price. They wish to trade-in their 2 cars to buy the Bravo. We offered to take in one of their cars (the Subaru) which belongs to the husband at $11K which is at the full settlement figure (of his current loan) and the wife’s car (Honda Fit) which is at the standard market value. The husband was impressed and we then proceeded on to explain the price for the Bravo. The couple was happy with the price that was offered to them (for the new car as well as for the trade-in cars) and commented that it is a good deal. They seemed happy to go ahead.</p>
              <p>2. The sales executive explained to them that in order for them to secure COE and the vehicle color of their choice, they had to pay a deposit of $3K. They agreed and so the sales executive requested for their credit card. The transaction went through. The sales executive had not at any time forced them to make any payment. It was only because they had expressed the intention to go ahead with the purchase that she explained the need to make a deposit. This is the normal procedure for booking a car, and reserving the color/COE etc.</p>
              <p>3. Thereafter, they requested for a test drive. Whilst we agree it may seem unusual for a buyer to make a booking and then ask for a test drive, it is by far not an isolated case.  Our sales staff brought them out for a long test drive which the husband first test drove followed by the wife. After the test drive, the couple and the sales executive went to the showroom, sat down and discussed about the ownership of the new car.  By this time, it was almost 5pm. During the discussion, the wife revealed that she had just resigned from her job so suggested that it was better to have the vehicle registered under the husband’s name. This seemed to have taken the husband by surprise and they started a discussion between themselves and seemed like it was a heated discussion.</p>
              <p>4. After a while, they requested to discuss alone among themselves. After about half an hour, the couple came back and informed the sales executive that they decided not to proceed with the purchase and wanted the sales executive to void the credit card transaction. At the point of time, the sales executive explained that they have to wait for the admin/accounts department to do the necessary procedure but they still insisted that they wanted the transaction to be void immediately. The sales executive told them that she did not know how to do this and that she will have to seek assistance for this. They left and refused to hear any further explanation. Since then we tried to contact them but to no avail. In essence we need to have the couple to either contact the Company or attend at the Company’s showroom to enable the transaction to be unwound.</p>
              <p>Whilst we feel that the posting by the couple is unjustified and the recall of events  untrue, we wish to make clear to this couple, that the company has at all times been ready to unwind this transaction and understand that they wanted to void this due to the change in circumstances. We suggest that the couple contact Ms Ng at 68422222 during office hours to have this matter resolved amicably.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It is so funny to see your pathetic efforts to save your company's image here by trying to twist every words from the facts. First of all, you are NOT the salesgirl who have attended to me personally and you are NOT even FIT to reply here in this post. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I have the actual events that are not so exactly as what you have written in defence of your company's reputation. Your incorrect statement is in RED. My reply in BLUE.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. This couple was introduced by one of our Bravo customers. They walked into the showroom and was served by one of our sales executives. They went through the specifications of the Bravo for about 45 mins and information relating to the car was clearly explained to them, after which, they sat down and went through the trade-in price. They wish to trade-in their 2 cars to buy the Bravo. We offered to take in one of their cars (<span style="color: #ff0000;">the Subaru</span>) which belongs to the husband at <span style="color: #ff0000;">$11K</span> which is at the full settlement figure (of his current loan) and the wife’s car (Honda Fit) which is at the standard market value. The husband was impressed and we then proceeded on to explain the price for the Bravo. The couple was happy with the price that was offered to them (for the new car as well as for the trade-in cars) and commented that it is a good deal.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> They seemed happy to go ahead.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am not driving a Subaru. My full settlement is not $11K. "They seemed happy to go ahead" does NOT mean I want to go ahead. Assuming is not confirming.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The sales executive explained to them that in order for them to secure COE and the vehicle color of their choice, they had to pay a deposit of $3K.

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The salesgirl did NOT explain to us on the deposit of $3K. She asked for my I/C and credit card only when she recommend me for a test drive. She has misled me when I asked her why she has swiped my credit card for a 3K transaction and all she said the amount is for any "backup" purpose in case there is any damage during the course of test drive. There is no deposit form for me to sign and all what the salesgirl DO is TO SWIPE MY CREDIT CARD!!!!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Thereafter, they requested for a test drive. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Whilst we agree it may seem unusual for a buyer to make a booking and then ask for a test drive, it is by far not an isolated case.</span>  Our sales staff brought them out for a long test drive which the husband first test drove followed by the wife.

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There is no heated discussion between my wife and me. It is rather a discussion on the HIGH PRICE of your small 1.4L CAR!!!!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. After a while, they requested to discuss alone among themselves. After about half an hour, the couple came back and informed the sales executive that they decided not to proceed with the purchase and wanted the sales executive to void the credit card transaction. <span style="color: #ff0000;">At the point of time, the sales executive explained that they have to wait for the admin/accounts department to do the necessary procedure but they still insisted that they wanted the transaction to be void immediately.

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At that point of time, the first thing I heard from your salesgirl is "You have wasted my time! I will not have lost a customer if I have not attended to you!". And the next thing happened is that your salesgirl trying her "VERY" best to act busy in front of the credit card machine, and coming back to us in 10 mins, telling my wife and me that I have to forfeit my $3K. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I have passed my number to my friend, who is customer to you and he in turn have passed my number to you for you to call me and I waited for the entire day for you to call, and YOU DID NOT EVEN BOTHER to call me.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">After all this explanation and you still feel is injustified and I'm just plain smearing you and your company's reputation, here's something to add salt to wound. It is not exactly the same case, but I guessed your company has already make BIG HEADLINES in newspaper and the forums. You guys are just wanted to make people fall into your bloody little tricks of yours and sucking our hard-earned money. Talk about customer service, YOU SUCK BIG TIME!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Think twice if you want to reply again, Vivng, cos this is NOT THE END. If you want to resolve this amicably, I'm sorry cos I CANNOT give you another chance for you to BITE on ME.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Kurt. They like to twist their words. Well my experience of buying from them is not a good one. Nearly went to case. Worst experience in my life. I truly regret buying from them. I don't like the way they do their business. Not honest to the bone. From personal experience I will not trust them at all... Thumbs down to them. Never thought an authorized dealer will resort to such sale tactics. Pls be wary guys...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Those who intend to buy, do dbl check the sales agreement. Verbal promises of accessories should be included. Trade in value of cars should also be written in the agreement. And double check the figures tally cos they may promise a certain trade in value but on paper states a lower value. That's how pathetic they are. Trying their luck to see if we are not careful enough to dbl check. Personally, bring your business elsewhere. Not worth the risk. I have learn my lesson and hope can warn other consumers...</div>

                  yup the same outfit. the worst thing is the ceo denied to the reporters that she is aware of such schemes happening at her dealership. for crying out loud she is the one who recommended the scheme to my friend when they wanted to get a car from her. makes my blood boils when i heard that. and now seeing whats happening to kurt, it seems they are still up to their dirty old ways.. shame shame shame! about time all this come to a stop.. can we report to case or something?

              <p>hi bro and sis...just to share my experience at Fiat Sin Ming. I walked into showroom in Sep 2010 one day. Was told by Fiat staff that they would take my current car at full settlement figure if I buy a Fiat Bravo or Punto Evo. They gave 15% discount off list price plus additional $5000 discount. Sounds like a great deal but did not commit because I wasn't familiar with Fiat cars. 1 lady was quite pushy and wanted me to commit to the purchase. But I said I did not drive the car there that day and had a meeting to rush to...so just walked out of the showroom. Beware of psychological warfare tactics dat's all I can say. Sometimes one might even feel humiliated when you sit in front of the person trying to sell you a metal on wheels....Just be careful when you step into any showroom.</p>
              <p>I've owned 6 cars to-date and I must say all my experiences were great and happy during purchase time. This one...sadly was my first lousy experience at a car company. The love of money is the root of all evil....heard dat one b4?</p>
              <p>There are many good cars out there on the market so take your time and buy from the one you feel most comfortable with.</p>
              <p>Take care everyone...</p>

              <p>Actually why would anyone want to buy a Fiat when its resale is not very good in Singapore. 1 dealer shared with me that after 3 years....a brand new Fiat will lose more than 50% of its value. This was confirmed by UK What Car magazine too. Of course performance in terms of century sprint (8.5sec from 0 to 100 km/h) is great for such a 1.4 L Turbo car.</p>
              <p>I think Toyota, Mazda, Nissan and Honda hold their value well, if not, better. I bought my Toyota Corolla in 2008 at $58k and sold it recently for $47k (took 10 yr loan @2.8%). My full settlement with bank was 47k! and didn't have to top-up.</p>
              <p>With a Fiat...I'm not too sure if that can happen (no top-up if take full loan at end of 3rd year).</p>
              <p>Fiat Bravo <strong>OMV</strong> now about <strong>17k</strong> only. Worth buying @ <strong>$114900</strong>?</p>
              <p>If buying <strong>Fiat Bravo 1.4 T-Jet</strong>, which is better? <strong>Manual </strong>or<strong> Auto</strong>?</p>
              <p>I heard that fuel consumption about 1L=10km in Singapore's stop-go traffic. Any Fiat Bravo owners can comment?</p>
