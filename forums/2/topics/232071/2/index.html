            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ponders:</div><div class="quote_body">can. but you would frustrate the contract between you and them.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hmm, but the car sellers were the one who breached the terms of contract first. I read in the papers recently that this constitutes cheating. If I am not wrong, COE can be transferred to other cars from other sellers. I think if the car is in Singapore and the buyer has not signed the bank agreement yet, I think the say is with the buyer. Cos the seller has brought the car in, and the buyer has only paid maybe a $500 or $1000 initial payment.<br><br>The seller is stuck with the car, the buyer is stuck with only losing the initial payment, which can be reclaimed through CASE.<br><br>Correct me if I am wrong though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm i dont think u can sue them for the late delivery of your car, and if not wrong u also will not sign any document that says about the late delivery or deliver date. but if u want to cancel your car they can sue u, cos u had signed some document that says u can't void the deal once they got the COE for u. wait abit longer maybe shipment delay.. cheers bro~</div>
