Its a lovely road.. and if I do see cyclists on the road, I give them a wide berth because generally its a quiet road. But yeah, the headwind and the vortex from passing BIG trucks, make them wbbly even.<br><br>That's why really got to be careful because lots of cars ALSO think its a lovely road to DRIVE at full speed there. It's depressing to see cyclists continue to persist in dangerous practises, such as not checking the road (and taking for granted the cars will see them) and cycling side by side.<br><br></div>
