I live in Australia, but the cars are basically the same as in Singapore.<br><br>Any tips as to which one to choose over the other? One (though not only) factor is which one do you think would impress girls more?<br><br></div>

I can't remember what were the other ones ... whatever the case my confidence in Mazda cars has been badly shaken ....<br><br>I drive a north american civic myself ... it's extremely fuel efficient, has good steering ... the only complaint is that the ride is a bit stiffer than most other cars ... I test drove the new civic, and it's a pretty awesome car ... the dash is very futuristic, but digital dashes will give you a lot of pain if it goes kaput ... the wheels has been moved forward in the body, so it's even more responsive than it was .... compared to the mazda 3, it's almost like a class apart ... but that's just me ...</div>

As a daily driver the MPS is ok. No one really drives it as a sport car all the time. And at $40,000 it is also a performance bargain. A BMW 130i would be better but it costs double the price.</div>

Nothing else in this price range is as fast in a straight line. The WRX may challenge it, but only because it has AWD and can launch from 6000rpm (at risk of the clutch though<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).</div>
