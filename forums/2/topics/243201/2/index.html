            <div class='col-md body'>i have driven my mazda 3  2 litre for 2.5 yrs....i have travelled around western australia and it is now in victoria....never had a single problem. but if i were u i would get a 2nd hand and cut down on your depreciation losses. too bad when i bought my car there were no decent 1-2yr old cars in this class so i bought it new.<br><br>btw the FC of this car can beat a toyota corolla 1.8. tested and proven on road trip with 2 cars driving together</div>
