            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah i think I agree, haha 3 of my friends also got 18 points on the re-test. I think if the tester can see that you are well able to drive, they will give you quite a few minor demerit points and tell you to learn from them, but still pass you. Thats what he told me 'I can see you can drive, but there are still some things that you have to work on'. It's really up to them if they want to pass you or not, they can always add points here or there to fail you if they really wanted to and didn't think you were ready.<br><br>Lucky I had test at 11:45 at BBDC, roads were really quiet so didn't have to worry at all about lane changing or congestion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

You always can try your best to pass TP on your next attempt <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you are school candidate, the chance of getting retest slot within next 14 days is 5 to 10%. Try to check your account every 1 - 3 hour at the night. The probability of getting earlier test date cancelled by other people at the night is quite higher than the probability at the morning or afternoon. It all depend on the luck.<br><br>I have 2 friends from BBDC. Yes, both were school candidate... You know what? I know you would say it's very crazy to do this. But I tell you ... They kept checking their account every 1 or 2 hour just after they failed their TP on that day. Of course, they were too depressed so they took hassle to get the earliest retest slot... My first friend took 3 days (while checking his account every 1 - 3 hours) to get the earliest retest slot which is just 9 days away from the previous test slot. Another friend of mine just took 7 hours (checking her account every 1 hour straight away after she failed her TP) to book for her next test slot which was just 5 days later. Both my friends passed their TP on their next attempt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But for CDC and SSDC, I am not sure though. Anyone else can enlighten this?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Especially the ramps going up and down inside them, very easy to scratch the corners which is why you always see many scratches and marks on the sides  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
