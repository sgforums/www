(example: how many pts deducted for nt checking blindspot, etc.....) can anyone give me a guide? i dun wish to make all those mistakes that will cause me to fail. my current instructor is fierce and he doesnt like to ans my questions. so pls help!! thanks! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> [/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are private candidate right?<br><br>Ok, I list out some common mistakes here ranging from 2 to 4 points<br><br>Fail to check blindspot - 4 points<br>Fail to check mirror before slowing down or turning - 2 points<br><br>In some case other than below-4 points mistake, you will get 6 to 10 points for each mistake made like:<br><br>Fail to slow down when approaching road hazard - 6 points<br>Cause other vehicles to take evasive action - 8 points<br>Stop on pedestrian crossing - 10 points<br><br>There are 64 mistakes in total. About 5 or 10 of them will give Immediate Failure if you make one of these mistakes.<br><br>So my advice to you is to check blindspot and also mirror everytime before you doing the turning whether it is left or right. It's not worthy of being penalised for failing to check blindspot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I recommend you go to Popular bookshop and purchase the book 'Ace The Final Driving Theory Test: 400 Final Theory Questions and Answers'.  Very cheap, less than $10<br>I know you passed final theory already, but this book is extremely useful because in the back of it it has ' Class 3 Driving Test Assessment Checklist' where it shows every possible offence, and the demerit points you get if you commit any of them. Also shows how to automatically fail. Very useful to read and check. My TP is next wednesday, quite nervous  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

And while you are reversing your car into the lot, be sure to turn your head back and look through rearwindow every 5 seconds, and at the same time, keep your lookout on your both side until your car is in the lot.<br><br>This also go to the same thing for directory change course.

I was looking at the TP checklist and it says you can get demerit points for failing to adjust mirrors before you start driving.. Well if I have my warm-up before the test and adjust the mirrors then, what if I don't need to adjust again, can still lose points?</div></blockquote>hmmmm my instructor says dat at least pretend to move the mirrors up n down abit! haha... all is abt acting de la. v diaoz ritez?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, as what joyanz has said, just make it more exaggerated to adjust the mirror. This will save you from being penalized with 2 demerit points. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
