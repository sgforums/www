Or if you want something slightly bigger but still have good FC and value for money, why not the Toyota Vios as well.</div>

Regarding the petrol prices and car prices, I am well aware of it, financial strain and all, my original budget was actually quite a bit higher, but I since I am the only one using the car I felt that a lower budget was in order... And after trawling the forums for a while (a long while) I have sort of narrowed the choice to:<br><br>1. honda fit<br>2. toyota vios<br>3. nissan sunny<br>4. suzuki swift<br><br>all 2nd hand of course, you guys are right!<br><br>Regarding golf sets, max there will be 2 sets of clubs in it.<br><br>I would like to expand my questions further at this juncture...<br><br>Regarding all these cute little cars, I had a gander at sg carmart at it seems that the second hand values of these cars are quite high! A 2005 vios for 42k?? I thought they only cost 50k brand new sometime this year, and that was the new shape..<br><br>Are the prices a true reflection of value here or are we expected to bargain (I used to live in australia before coming back for NS and that's the way the used car market is over there)<br><br>Am I better off buying form an "owner" or a dealer??<br></div>

That, and dealers charge higher for them than normal. If you wanna get a "good buy", you need to trawl sgcarmart everyday.
