            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Last Friday (7 May 10) at about 8pm at Rangoon Rd (near Farrer Park MRT and City Square Mall), my dad fell victim to road rage. A black car signaled to my dad’s car (silver in colour) to reverse so that the black car could park at the roadside. The moment my dad tried to reverse, the car behind him honked at him. My dad then stopped reversing cos there was nothing he could do. Suddenly the black car reversed at high speed. Despite my dad honking loudly to warn him, he rammed into my dad's car. 2 men covered in tatoos came out of the car and surrounded my dad. One pulled at my dad’s collar, raising his fist and threatening to beat him up if he didn't pay for damages. He insisted it was my dad's fault for not reversing. He demanded payment on the basis that it was his car rear that got banged. It was an outright pervasion of the law. Feeling endangered, my dad could only accede to his demands, not knowing that it was a case of road rage and the other driver could be charged with assault and battery. There were many onlookers, but none offered help.</p>
              <p>On advice of my lawyer friends, I would like to appeal to any witnesses, especially the driver of the car behind the silver car, to step forward and speak up as a voice of justice. Pls reply this thread if you saw anything, or if you think you saw and need to clarify. All you have to do is to tell the insurance company what happened when they call. There’s no need to show your face at all if you don’t want to. I truly appreciate your help. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Kindly state the make of both cars involved. The race of the road bullies. You should report this incident to the cops.</p>

              <p>The cases that you read on papers are classified as Voluntarily Causing Hurt under section 323 of the Penal code Chapter 224. The illustration is defined under section 321.</p>
              <p>This is a non-seizeable case. As such for most non-seizeable cases, the complainant will have to make a magistrate's complaint to set the case into motion. The police would have already conducted preliminary investigations on scene by gathering the facts and particulars of both parties. However if the complainant wishes to pursue the matter it is up to them to make the complaint to the magistrate to set the case into motion and there after the magistrate will either direct the police to investigate into the case further or will make judgement if he or she deems the evidence is sufficient.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope you can understand that not all offences will result in the accused getting arrested on the spot. For eg. people do not get arrested for littering or jaywalking.</p>
