            <div class='col-md body'>which civic model? haha me ain't no pro but just share my vague understanding...<br><br>lookswise ya the 3's quite flashy, think the 5-door's e nicer one. but the civic ain't far behind just that it looks more tamed down as a family car now. but maybe better, less beng identity eh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> fc wise, the efficient honda engine brings fuel economy, as long as u don't often wake the vtec it'll be very light on e wallet. heard some bad comments abt the 3's fc though. maybe cos engine quite outdated... handling wise, if i'm not wrong the 3 takes the platform of ford, which's famous for handling. the civic is however notorious for the paper-light chasis, so gotta touch up on the car if u're a speed freak...<br><br>performance wise it's obvious. for a power-oriented me, the power of dreams is my choice <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TOD,<br>Tks for your valuable comments. I truly believe Honda is a car that can keep for long but is in a dilema now as i believed there will be a model change soon for the Civic, maybe within a year or so.<br>I must say the Mazda 3 exterior appeals to me very much but am not sure of its 'drivability'. Moreover, it is now pricier than the civic!<br>Is it easy to get a Mazda mechanic for servicing? Heard the spare parts for Mazda is higher too! Anyone can confirm on this?<br>Tks again for all comments!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About the only thing I find attractive about the civic is the smooth VTEC engine; probably the best in class.<br><br>Design wise, either exterior or interior, Mz3 is the winner. Main reason I chose Mz 3 over civic is the European-like ride &amp; handling. Mz 3 drives more like an European car -- very good steering feel, sticks to the road when negotiating bends.<br><br>Finally, civic has been around for some time; so face risk that model will change soon. My guess is that Kah Motors will source the new civic from Thailand.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think If cost saving is the top priority, should go for TOYOTA.  Honda is famous on its powerful VTEC engine.  Mazda is well know for its sports car style.  What for to buy a civic or mz3 and drive like a turtle to save petrol?<br><br>If you want fast acceleration, forget about MZ3.  It is the strength of civic.<br><br>If you want the looking and style, go for MZ3.  In fact, I like the latest facelifted civic exterior deisgn also.  However, its interior is far far behind, very out of dated.  In term of internal space, MZ3 win also.  it is wider an has longer wheel base.<br><br>If you want handling and driving stability, I think MZ3 is better.  Thanks to its heavy, rigid plat form,  electric hydraulic steeling system,  and multilink rear suspention.<br><br>If you want safety, I have no doubt MZ3 will be the suvivor, no matter civic hit mz3 or mz3 hit civic.  MZ3 platform is designed in volvo lab for new S40.  Original deisgn of MZ3 comes with 6 air bags and two air curtains.  But when MM bring it in, they remove most of them and left one or two.<br><br>If you want a proven reliable car.  civic will be the choise.  anyway, mz3 was only born for one year.  Reliability always take time to prove.<br><br>If you want to get the car ASAP, go for civic.  If order MZ3, typical waiting time is 4 month.  Wait until you neck long long.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi cyberpug,<br><br>It's easier to decide if you list your criteria for a car. What's most important to you, followed by things of decreasing importance. For me, the first thing to consider was price. After that, the most important to me is power. Then petrol consumption, comfort, handling, external appearance. That's why I decided on the 2004 Civic VTI which replaced my earlier model Civic that I drove for 8 years.<br><br>Your criteria may be different, though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have not looked at the Mazda 3, so I'm biased. However, the Civic VTI has all those points:<br>1. Spacious - front and back. There's no drive shaft tunnel - it's completely flat behind, so the rear passengers have more space. The boot space is also very big.<br>2. FC is good - about 11-13 kpl, depending on driving style.<br>3. Resale value - should be good. It's a Honda. Very easy to maintain too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Civic has more rear legroom for sure. A bit cramped in the back of my friend's 3, like it's designed for younger drivers with less consideration for passengers in the back compared to the tamer Civic. The 3 is also heavier (and therefore more steady around corners I felt), so needs a heavier right foot to get it moving compared to the Civic. Also the reason why Civic has better FC 14+ km/L (tho depends on mood). 3 is more expensive isnt it? But it looks better anyway.</div>

IMHO i think the Nissan N16 has bigger leg room compared to the MZ3 ... (sat in both before)</div>
