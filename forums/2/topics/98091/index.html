            <div class='col-md body'>we have opinions of course, but some ppl seem to think that its a crime to offer said opinions. I quote from another forum:<br><br>"Actually i feel that once u pple make a point that it is not a good sports car, then maybe you guys should stop there...imagine some guy owning some of those cars that u guys are mentioning about.<br><br>One statement on your opinion is ok..but to keep repeating and stressing that it sucks...that isnt too nice right?<br><br>Maybe some guy who isnt doing too well to do and buys a cheap coupe and loves it alot? or maybe some guy who dunno much about cars and bought it for its looks?  Can u imagine how he feel? If i had a Tuscani or a a RX 8 or whatever car that u guys black listed...i prob wouldnt turn up for any meetups at all if i know any of those pple that shoot me down will be going."<br><br>of course... the person quoted dun take into account what happens everytime someone asks the same question again. so what happens? to him it seems like some ppl like to keep giving their opinions of some cars. but then, im sure that u wun like it if everyone ignored your thread n the Q u asked right? That isnt too nice" also.<br><br>Anyways, my opinion of the tuscani is that, for about 100k, the V6 is quite a nice car to get. sure its not WRX fast but its a coupe, and there's just this certain sexiness about coupes. And it is certainly affordable. Do change the rims though. The stock ones aren't exactly things of beauty. And watch out for the FC. From personal experience, Hyundai cars' FC can be a bit suprisingly higher than u'd expect.</div>
