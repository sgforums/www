            <div class='col-md body'>Ermm. Seriously, I'd like to ask some of the guys here who post ridiculous stuff. Don't tell me you'd rather be so-so off rather than very well to do, I wouldn't believe a single word of it. Unless you tell me that all your life you've only dreamt of working hard to earn as much money as you can and you've never put your particulars down for a lucky draw, with hopes to win something, nor have you ever dreamt of suddenly striking gold, I wouldn't believe such blatant lies. Look if you were seriously working hard, or had the mind to, you wouldn't be here wasting your time talking rubbish on a forum; you'd have your studies or work to worry about.<br><br>It's true that there's no good reason to get sour just cause someone is better off than you. But sometimes when the person's character is undeserving of some good ol' respect, then out comes the words that shouldn't be heard by children. Sometimes the stuff he does, I'd say based on personal experience, definitely would fall under the latter category. I'd like to know how many of you here who speak about his character have interacted with him personally.<br><br>No offence, just my hard and honest opinions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cmon you guys and your bull crap abt wanting to work all this shit. If your dad offer to buy you car would you say no? just comforting yourself.Even i want my dad to buy me car but he says no. Although i know he can very well afford it.I too wish i was damn rich. so rich i can just take out "spare change" from my pockets to buy a car or house on impulse and never regret cause i have too much money. you guys say if you had got a filthy rich father u wont ask him buy you car ? all you liars are going to hell.<br><br>Criticise the rich kid cause he cannot drive "well" even if he could you guys would wfind ways to "shoot" him. All you rubbish abt "his father rich not him" Eventually the money will go to him. And i think u can call him rich too look at the car he drives. i doubt his allowance will be little.<br><br>If he was driving a normal car. or maybe a good car but nto super car would you guys shoot him like that ?<br><br>I admit i am too very jealous . at 18 and he has that sorta ride i mean, i doubht i can own that even when i hit 80. Unless somehow i set up a super good business.<br><br>These are just my 2cents. not meaning to insult anyone</div>
