            <div class='col-md body'>You'll not be able to claim insurance as your excess is definitely more than 100 bucks i am sure.......<br><br>Btw i look at it, its your fault anyway, so you just have to take responsibility.  Let this be a small lesson.<br><br>But, 100 for that small scratch is a little too much though...... maybe just tell him 50 or forget it. He won't go to police for sure........... as nobody will give a d*mn abt this small scratch.</div>
