Once I wanted to buy a STi, but was shocked by the insurance quote of $5k plus! I owned Lancer, Civic VTi, BMW coupe, MR-S, Rav4 2-dr, Silvia S14, RX-8, Renault Cabrio-coup and currently, Mini Cooper S. So hope this will give you a rough guide...<br><br>From the cars you want to buy, it's going to be expensive. Trust me, somemore thanks to the recent accidents, premium will surely go up again. And based on your age, you falls into the youngest age group which will be the most expensive as well...<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Cheers</div>

The rest all 2dr car, as I dont like to fetch people around... As said, all my premium are above the $3000 region. My most expensive premium is MR-S, which cost me $3800 +-. For the S14 it about $3400, and RX-8 is about $3500...<br><br>I am not very sure Euro R, but it's performance car, same category as rex and evo. And somemore it's Honda, I presume that the premium will be at least $3400 under your name with no NCD. And don't forget that premium will generally be higher if you get PI cars rather than cars from agents here.<br><br>Euro R is PI, so prepared to pay a bit more.<br><br>cheers</div>

Not to forget, less then 27yr old got to pay 1k to 2k extra<br><br>Best is get those who are above 40 and have more then 15 yrs exp, would be lower. 2 yrs back I ask for WRX premuims, AIG quote 5.8K. But i ask under my dad name only 2.5k for 0% he was 48 with more then 20 yrs license.</div>
