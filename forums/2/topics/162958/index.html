I bought my Jazz when the COE was ard 12K... non-gurantee, 4 bids.<br>Only managed to get the last round (2nd bid).<br>First round they bidded for me at 13.1K, second bidding was 14.8K which they subsequently increase to $15.3K to ensure i got the COE...<br><br>I guess its a matter of whether they want to release the car to you. Mine is already in which i think that was the reason why they went all out to secure the COE for me...<br><br>There are other Jazz buyers who bought the same time as me but did not get as the colour they choose is ony coming in Jan, so did not get the COE this time round like me.</div>

Do you really fancy the fuel-gulping Sunny so much? Else, I think it's a blessing you didn't get the COE. My advise is that you should not compromise your ground. Standfast and go through the 6 biddings. If they are sincere to sell, they WILL get you a COE. If this is the attitude they show while trying to sell you something, imagine their after-sales attitude when they do sold you something... All things said, go get the deposit back from TC after the 6th unsuccessful bid and walked into a Honda/Mitsubishi or Toyota showroom. The 3 brands are listed companies (Mit by C&amp;C, Toyota by Borneo Motors under Inchcape and Nissan by Tan Chong). They are volume-driven; not profit driven. They are fighting amongst themselves for the top spot in the car sales chart. Even while Honda is notorious for being profit driven, they do have credible track records that they do eventually get you a COE at the end of the day. If TC don't mind losing a potential cust, I'm sure C+CKM or BM would be very glad to gain one. Simple Mathematics of balance; One man's lost is another man's gain.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hi Ponders</strong><br>In a real situation, this will happen. Eg. dealer bids for you 11k but result was 14k. Before COE closes, if the dealer did not revise your bid to 14k, you are out bid, i.e. you cannot get a COE with the original bid of 11k.<br><br>A sincere dealer will revise your bid to 14k if he wants to release the car to you. So if you bought the car at a COE of 14k, that is the COE price that will stick to your car for the next 10 years. If the dealer revise your 11k bid to 14k without sucking 3k from you, you win 3k , dealer loses 3k.<br>--------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Hi purecat</strong><br><br>About the top-up scam, be careful. You can top up 1.5k when COE is 14.7k but dealer can give you their ex-stock of 12k COE. That will be your loss then.<br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Hi SeeTees</strong><br><br>Thanks for your advice. The moment i saw them bidding 10k (for 2 bids) for me, i know that they already don't have the intention to give me the car. So I have prepared NOT to get their Sunny but look for other brand. No use begging dealer when they are not sincere.<br></div>

No use begging dealer when they are not sincere.<br>[/b]</blockquote><strong>Hi PaulQ</strong><br><br>Don't get too upset with the dealers. Its more about making business sense than sincerity here. If its about sincerity, then why have the 6-bid policy ? It would have been garranteed COE for all purchases. If they don't want to sell you the car, then I don't think they'll take you booking at all ..... why go thru all the paperwork when nothing is gonna come out of it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The dealers and SEs are just making a living. I'm sure they'll be glad to get you the car if it is viable (i.e. not having to pay out from their own pocket, etc !). As for the amount of profit, sometimes you get lucky and meet a SE desperately trying to meet sales target and he or she will get you the car even if they lugi a small amount in the whole transaction. Otherwise, its only natural that the SEs will try to get more out of the deal. After all, they also have housing loan, car loan and family commitment to fulfill.</div>

If Cat A COE values at 14k and the Open Cat E is at 16k then u pay 16k for the sake of scrapping at 14k worth of value. Do you think it's worth it at all to pay that extra amt??? So what if the SE agreed to top up a bit while u also top a bit?? In the first place its their job to top up to the required amount cos they are not getting a cat A coe for u...</div>
