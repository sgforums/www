All 2nd hand cars will already have a COE that is paid for. Only when you buy a car that is at the end of its life (e.g 9.9 yrs old car due for scrap), then you will need to get a renewed COE for the car to continue driving it for another 10 yrs.<br><br>But usually dealer will include a new COE in the sale.<br><br>As for 3000cc car... are you getting....

Most probably you are looking for something sporty/tiong looking with decent power.<br><br>I think you can consider the old GC rexes (around $4.5k depre/yr) for power and decent 'sporty' looks or else the good ol' Civics EG or EK. Can do up to be rex-eaters easily, and still looks nice IMHO (no choice, have to say it look nice cuz I driving one...haha.. )<br><br>Tot of changing to Evo, S15 or worse come to worse, Rex (too common), but at the expense of my lifestyle, forget it. Car is after all a liability.<br><br>Stock Rex or STi still possible, but its pretty 'weak' for a 220/265-280 bhp car. Acceleration is brisk, but nothing fancy. Boring. And still relatively expensive. Rex also so common that it is in the same 'ah-beng' classification league as civic. (Though of course a lot of them think they are actually better, but oh well.... )<br><br>You can also consider Swift Sport or Colt Version-R if you don't mind hot hatches. For the price of a 2-3 yr old rex, you can get these hatches brand new.<br><br></div>
