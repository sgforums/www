            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to ask if anyone here has encounters with hit and run cases with no personal injuries involved?<br><br>Some time ago a lancer hit the rear end of my car when the driver cut out without looking. The driver then drove off pretending nothing had hapen. Since I was loaded with family members in the car I decided not to give a chase and recorded down his license plate.<br><br>While making the police report they directed me to IDAC as it was not a police matter but an insurance matter. They said I should make an insurance claim against the car invloved, bottomline was they dun wanna do paperwork.<br><br>My problem was my car was then 2 months away from scrap (no point repairing), and I needed the car to get to work everyday. I really wanted to just make the driver see the error of his ways i.e demerit points etc.<br><br>So it seems that the law actually encourages the drivers to drive away after a collision. Likely outcomes after a collision<br><br>1. Drive away quickly through traffic hoping that the other driver didn't manage to catch ur License plate. Since the law will not prosecute you and even if he did see your license you end up having to pay for damages anyway.<br><br>2. Pull over and negotiate a settlement (assuming non-private settlement"), which would lead to your insurace getting hit anyway. Therefore the first method should be choosen.<br><br>It may even be harder to make a claim  if the other driver does not come forth, cause it'll be his word vs urs and both sides with end up having to come to an agreement which could take ages.<br><br>Is there any other experience anyone can share? or other authorities that can be approached in this situation?<br></div>

Your insurance company will find the other party and will contact him on the matter.. so it is simple just let them handle the situation....</div>

But if the law doesn't penalize hit and run cases it sort of encourages the driver to drive off knowing the outcome will be the same regardless if he stops or not, he'll probably drive off hoping that no one managed to see his license no in time.<br><br>If the police do penalize hit and run via demerits etc ontop of compensation the driver might think twice before driving off.<br><br>Anyway I didn't claim insurance for my matter cause my car was due for scrap in 2 months then. No point going without the car for a few days just to get even with him. Though I wish the police could at least send him a letter warning him to be more careful.</div>
