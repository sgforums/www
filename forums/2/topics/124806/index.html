But i can't afford the Toyota Vios.<br>Does anyone knows the octane level for Getz? And if Getz can consume 92 fuel??  Had asked the salesman at hyundai, he said Getz need 91 only.

Both can get 16km/L easily. With discipline and FC enhancement device, you might get 20km/L. And both cars are definitely within your budget.<br><br>Of course, go for Manual cars if you can. Because the differences in FC could be a good 2km/L. Too bad Getz got not manual car at 1.3cc. And go for Getz 1.6 if you can afford it. It package is much better for an additional of S$2-3k. And it is definitely much more powerful than its little brother. Might even be stronger than Aveo.</div>

If the COE drops below $17K (which I'm sure it will), the $17K rebate will be used to offset a portion of the ARF, which if I'm not wrong, stands at 110% of the import price of the car now. Anyway, with the sudden surge in bank interest rates, there is added pressure on COE prices. Besides, neither the economy nor the people's pay has gone up as much as the petrol prices &amp; cost of living!! So how to justify higher COE prices??<br><br></div>
