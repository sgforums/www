            <div class='col-md body'>i have this misconception of HIGH/LOW COE too..<br><br>here's what i perceive it is..correct me if im wrong<br><br>when one buys a car...some money goes to the car maker/agent and some goes to the govt..the portion that goes to the govt are in terms of COE and ARF<br><br>Hence when i wanna trade in a car, i'll be able to get a 'rebate' from the remaining value of my current ARF and COE..however this rebate is not in the form of cash and thus can only be used to cover the cost of ARF and COE of the new car..<br><br>so to say..COE of a new car now for eg..$14k and ARF $12k..total $26k...if i wanna change car 4-5 yrs down the road...say COE in the future will be $25k..<br><br>The rebate i'll be able to get will be calculated and definitely be lower than the original $26k...thus this rebate can actually barely cover the cost of a new car in future if u wanna upgrade..<br><br>vice versa...a car with a high COE and ARF/PARF value...a 4 yr old car now will have a value of roughly $35k, a good gauge.. Thus when this rebate is used to buy a new car now...it will practically cover the cost to be paid to the govt..this i suppose is the ''security'' those 2nd hand car dealers are referring to..<br><br>however, i have a qns..if say i have a rebate of $35k..where will the remaining $10k go to since current COE and ARF value is, for eg ard $25k...will it be forfeited??<br><br>pls correct me if im wrong...coz i base the above info from my own research...didnt really consult anyone on this</div>

If the second hand is only cheaper than the new car by few K, think no one will buy the second hand car, then finally the second hand car will be scrap. by scraping the car, the owner will be loosing quite an amount too, maybe loosing the same amount as a new car buyer but dont enjoy driving a new car.

For example, 4 years ago, a 2-3 years old Nissan Sunny was 20k lower than brand new Nissan Sunny. People might still choose second hand one.<br><br>Now, brand new and second hand differs by 3-4k, no one will bother about it. End up, people buy new car, second hand car owner scrap his car at paper value. If the second hand car owner actually bought the car as second hand, he might benefit, else back to square coz he paid much higher few years back.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coolblue6699:</div><div class="quote_body">Secondly, if I am taking a loan, higher paper (higher COE) will cause a higher interest payable cos I need to load more.

Same brand and model.<br><br><strong>New Car Purchase Price : S$60K<br>Actual Paper Value (this is very important) : PARF + current COE + Body Value = S$13000 + S$15000 + S$5000 = S$33K<br>Your New Car Purchase + Interest will cost you = S$75K (est)<br>Your Negative Equity = S$75K - S$33K = S$42K</strong><br><br>In other words ... your new car is only valued at 33K on its first day you drive out of the showroom. You owe bank S$75K. If anything happens (accident / stolen) ... you will have to pay the bank that 42K you still owe them.<br><br>To breakeven with a new car ... you need at least 6 yrs of instalment payments. Meaning no new car for you for 6 years, you have to stick to this new car you bought for 6 long years.<br><br><strong>2nd Hand Car Purchase Price (2003 model) : S$50K<br>The first owner bought the car likely at 70K plus, with added interest will cost him about S$80K for the car.<br>Actual Paper Value (this is very important) : PARF + current COE + Body Value = S$13000 + S$31000 + S$2000 = S$46K<br>Your 2nd Car Purchase + Interest will cost you = S$65K (est)<br>Your Negative Equity = S$65K - S$46K = S$19K</strong><br><br>The first owner lost about 80K - S$46K = 34K in 2 yrs of ownership ... the car is valued at 46K on your day of purchase. You owe bank S$65K. If anything happens (accident / stolen) ... you will have to pay the bank that 19K you still owe them.<br><br>To breakeven with a new car ... you need at least 3 yrs of instalment payments.<br><br>Thus 2nd hand car is a safer buy cause you owe bank less monies.<br><br>1) You can change to another car in 3 yrs vs 6 yrs for a new car<br>2) You owe a much lesser amount with the bank. Should anything happen, 19K is easier paid off than 42K<br>3) The brunt of the loss is paid by the 1st owner.<br><br>Thats the "safety" feature most 2nd hand car dealers are talkin about.<br></div>

Its tied to how long you wanna own the car.<br><br>For example ... if you buy a new car S$60K and lock in a 10 yr loan on it. Yes your depreciation is lower @ 5K per year .... but then again , to attain that, you gotta drive it and maintain it for 10 yrs.<br><br>If you decide to change within 4 yrs .... you are doomed. Your depreciation for your 4 yrs of ownership goes through the roof  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>In my line .... I meet many potential buyers who wanna change cars after 3 yrs of ownership, only to realise they cant because they have to top up finance about 20K.<br><br>ps : I am not a 2nd hand car dealer.</div>

I take in your car @ 37K.<br><br>2) How much you still owe finance ?<br><br>If nothing ... then 37K is yours to keep or you put in a 10K downpayment and keep 27K. If you owe finance more than 37K .... Rule 78 and Penalty for Early Redemption ..... then you must top up the diff. Sometimes this amount can be as high as 20-30K.<br><br>3) 40K since 2002. Check with your finance how much you still owe them. Then calculate the diff with your present Sunny. Like I say ... if your sunny is fully paid, no worries liao. Use the full paper, if not .... better to check.<br><br>For eg: (salah liao)<br>cost of car: $62k + interest = S$70K (example)<br>paper:        $29k<br>$70k - $29k = $41k<br><br>In my line ...

If you sell it earlier, you'll find that t fetchs a lower price because of the low COE.<br><br>So, it all boils down to how good you are at bargining, and it helps to buy direct from owner cos chances are, used car dealers will offer them the same low price.</div>

IMO i think e price for 2nd hand car should be priced jus slightly above paper value.  else it wont be attractive ..  esp e COE car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This sounds good, but nowadays 2nd car is only selling at 2-3k lower than new car price.

Same brand and model.<br><br>[b]New Car Purchase Price : S$60K<br>Actual Paper Value (this is very important) : PARF + current COE + Body Value = S$13000 + S$15000 + S$5000 = S$33K<br>Your New Car Purchase + Interest will cost you = S$75K (est)<br>Your Negative Equity = S$75K - S$33K = S$42K</strong><br><br>In other words ... your new car is only valued at 33K on its first day you drive out of the showroom. You owe bank S$75K. If anything happens (accident / stolen) ... you will have to pay the bank that 42K you still owe them.<br><br>To breakeven with a new car ... you need at least 6 yrs of instalment payments. Meaning no new car for you for 6 years, you have to stick to this new car you bought for 6 long years.<br><br><strong>2nd Hand Car Purchase Price (2003 model) : S$50K<br>The first owner bought the car likely at 70K plus, with added interest will cost him about S$80K for the car.<br>Actual Paper Value (this is very important) : PARF + current COE + Body Value = S$13000 + S$31000 + S$2000 = S$46K<br>Your 2nd Car Purchase + Interest will cost you = S$65K (est)<br>Your Negative Equity = S$65K - S$46K = S$19K</strong><br><br>The first owner lost about 80K - S$46K = 34K in 2 yrs of ownership ... the car is valued at 46K on your day of purchase.

Your PARF depending on the car still has a value of around S$7K - S$30K, but like I said depending on the car. Jap and Korean car most likely will be around S$7K - S$17K. Conti cars have much higher PARF values.<br><br>Body value ... you are at the mercy of the exporters. I have seen how my exporter works.

Yeah I am a new car agent. I try to help out as much as I can and know, just like how I assist my clients. For me, client rapport is very important, I dont wanna sell to a client if I got this feling that he is gonna end up in trouble from my purchase in years to come. Yeah believe it or not, I'd encourage him not to buy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong>i need the car for work. i will be driving the car heavily - maybe one day will be more than 60km (i guess you might know I want to take fuel consumption into consideration)</strong><br><br>Practical and Affordable is key. If you are looking for that, then there are some things you must consider.<br><br>Toyota has the best FC , but it is also quite expensive to start with. Kia has bad FC, but it is cheap. With these 2 scenarios .... consider this.<br><br>You buy Toyota, you pay for the brand name upfront in cash. Yes ... a Toyota Altis is almost S$12K more expensive than say a Kia Cerato. With this diff .... even if the Toyota Altis FC is much better, you are already putting S$12K ahead of your purchase. What I can say is .... you are most definitely not gonna be spending more than S$12K on petrol by driving the Kia.<br><br>So consider this point above. I get loads of customers who say .... ohhh Toyota good cause FC good , car engine can last. I ask them .... is it worth paying S$12K more , and incurring interest on that 12K ?? They tiam tiam cannot answer liao. Car engine can last ... goodness me, sometimes we forget we only own the car for only about 4 years on average. If you gonna own the car for a lifetime, I say go for the Toyota, else consider other cheaper options.<br><br><strong>like what you said, i might be selling off my car in 5 years time. But, the problem is I might not buy another car, as I intend to leave Singapore. I know this will be a key point to the decision. Can you help me to analyse, if i don't buy another new car after 5 years, or if i want to buy another car after 5 years, or if i want to keep the car for 10 years - total 3 situation</strong><br><br>Bro ... there is no scenario to analayse here. If you intend to use the car for 5 yrs only. Get it on a 7 yr loan scheme, if can get 5 yr loan scheme lagi better. End of loan ... scrap car and get about S$15K - S$20K in cash. Then you can decide, if you wanna buy new car ... use tha cash received from your scrap car and put it as downpayment for the new car. If not gonna buy, keep the money.<br><br>If you end up wanting to keep the car for 10 years .... no worries as you have finished instalment payments after 5 years. You can drive instalment-free for the next 5 years of the car's life. However, be prepared to start changing parts due to wear and tear. Most wear and tear items start asking to be replaced into the 6th year of the car's life or 120 000 km.<br><br><strong>basically, i want to know whether a brand new car is good for me, or a second hand car is good for me. If 2nd hand car is good, must buy old scheme car or new scheme car? </strong><br><br>This is tough to answer. Do you want to owe the banks so much interest ? If not, go 2nd hand. If you dont mind and got backup funds sitting in some Swiss bank, then go new. Your funds earn interest. You can offset this interest you gain from your deposits with the new car interest.<br><br>This is what I am doing now .... and believe it or not, my last new car was in 1990  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  The rest all 2nd hand  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br></div>

I take in your car @ 37K.<br><br>2) How much you still owe finance ?<br><br>If nothing ... then 37K is yours to keep or you put in a 10K downpayment and keep 27K. If you owe finance more than 37K .... Rule 78 and Penalty for Early Redemption ..... then you must top up the diff. Sometimes this amount can be as high as 20-30K.<br><br>3) 40K since 2002. Check with your finance how much you still owe them. Then calculate the diff with your present Sunny. Like I say ... if your sunny is fully paid, no worries liao. Use the full paper, if not .... better to check.<br><br>For eg: (salah liao)<br>cost of car: $62k + interest = S$70K (example)<br>paper:        $29k<br>$70k - $29k = $41k<br><br>In my line ... I see hordes of people comin in to change car after 2 yrs of ownership .... only to discover what kinda shit they got themselves into when they purchased their new car 2 yrs ago.<br><br>Most paiseh ... walkout of showroom knowing they cant buy a car for at least 4 more years. That 31K COE they bought their car with 2 yrs back have "locked them in". </div></blockquote>Alright I've paid for 4 yrs of my installment which equates to $31 248..my loan plus interests amt to $54 600 (thereabout)<br><br>I dun quite understand wad u mean if I've paid up the loan of more than the present paper value ($37k) than I'm fine..can u explain again??<br><br>SO presently for my case, if I wanna change car,,how much do I have to top up? And can the previous loan balance be brought forward to my new car's loan??<br><br>meaning..<br><br>New car price - watever I get in return from my old one - downpayment for new car + balance of previous loan(in this case abt $20k) = the amt I have to loan<br><br>bcoz from a layman's view..<br><br>a new car = $62k<br>my rebate = $37k<br>downpayment = $5k<br>amt i have to pay = $20k<br>old car's outstanding loan = $20k<br><br>new loan = $20k + $20k = $40k<br>which is the amt of money im current loaning..meaning I still pay the same installement but for a new car??<br><br>I believe the above is not completely true coz im still unsure abt the rebate part and whether i can carry forward my loan..pls show my some light brother<br><br>thanks man<br></div>
