I know nuts about Ferrari? U bet on that, I didnt even say I CAN afford it, EVEN IF i could afford it, I won't go for it..that's all i'm saying..I'm merely saying a Ferrari Mondial sucks..So what if you end up at a hotel lobby in this FERRARI and everybody "wows"? If within the guests there, there's a Ferrari enthusiast there, HE (and me included) would know that you are just driving an old piece of trash.. So would u rather get yourself a Testarossa or a Mondial that every Ferrari enthusiasts know is cheap and crappy? Even a Dino 246 is better than it if you want me to eliminate the "speed" equation from this debate..in case you don't know, Dino is a brand created by Ferrari last time to sell cheap sports car, but after the 206, 246 and 308 they discontinued this brand..</div>

Sure it might not match up performance-wise against the newer generation Ferrari's like the F430 or 599, but in it's day it was the dream car of many. Go to a Ferrari enthusiast site like Ferrarichat.com and see how many people bash the TR, or ask them how many think it's a cheap crappy car.</div>
