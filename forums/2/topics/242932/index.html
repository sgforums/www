D12 Peaking to Paris by Spyker....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Looks like an inflated C12 =P<br><br><img src="http://photo.netcarshow.com/Spyker-D12_Peking_to_Paris_2006_photo_01.jpg"><img src="http://photo.netcarshow.com/Spyker-D12_Peking_to_Paris_2006_photo_03.jpg"><br>The Spyker D12 Peking-to-Paris is a luxurious 4-door high performance SUV from the Dutch car manufacturer Spyker Cars. The model was introduced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show and production is scheduled to begin in late 2007. After the introduction there, the model already received well over 100 orders. The model was first introduced to the North-American market, which is believed to be its main market, at the New York motor show in April 2006. The name Peking-to-Paris refers to the Peking to Paris endurance rally held in 1907 from Peking (now called Beijing) in China to Paris in France, in which an almost standard Spyker car participated, driven by Frenchman Ch. Goddard. The Spyker car came in second in the rally after a three month drive.<br><br>Despite having a weight of 1,850 kg, the car still goes from 0-100 km/h (0-60 mph) in 5.0 seconds and has a top speed of 295 km/h. It achieves this by using a 500 bhp Audi W12 engine. Though being an SUV, the car has a lot of design features from Spyker's sports car, the C8, such as the "aeroblade" wheels and smooth rear view mirrors. Also notable is that the back seat doors are hinged at the rear, creating so called suicide doors.<br><br>Well, the made a hell of a bicycle  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><img src="http://photo.netcarshow.com/Spyker-Aeroblade_2006_photo_01.jpg"><img src="http://photo.netcarshow.com/Spyker-Aeroblade_2006_photo_07.jpg"><br><br>The sporty yet comfortable Aeroblade bike is hand-built using unique and innovative materials. Features are: a titanium frame, an aluminum front fork, wheel set and mudguards from aluminum covered carbon composite, Hulshof luxury leather handle bar grips and saddle and a special version of the Rohloff 14 speed hub gear transmission. Optional elements are, for instance, a choice of wheels (special Aeroblade wheels or standard), pedals and leather colours. The bike weighs a mere 12,8 kg. The construction and geometry of the frame and the effectiveness of the drive train leave the performance of the bike unrestricted. Each bike is specifically built for its new owner and individually numbered. The number will be engraved on a special plate attached to the frame.<br><br>The design of the bike is clearly recognizable as a Spyker. The Spyker logo is imprinted on the chain cover, the saddle and the saddle bag. The design of the mudguards has been based on the form of airplane wheel fairings as well as the swirled aluminum dashboard of the current Spyker. The colours of Spyker's endurance race car, the Spyker C8 Spyder GT2R, are reflected in the bike's colour combination. The frame is titanium silver, the tyres are orange. The spokes of the Koga Aeroblade wheels are reminiscent of Spyker's own AerobladeÂ™ wheels.<br><br>The suggested retail price for the bicycle, including the optional Aeroblade wheels, is 10.500 euro ex. VAT ( 12,540 USD). The Aeroblade bicycle can be ordered through the Koga specialist distribution channel, the worldwide Spyker dealer network or directly from Koga and Spyker Cars in The Netherlands. Deliveries of the bike are expected to commence by May 2006. Order intake for this exclusive limited production will start as of January 2006.<br><br>Spyker and Koga are both exclusive Dutch brands of high quality hand built exclusive products for those demanding clients who want only the best. They share a mutual passion for the five key words and brand values: heritage, design, craftsmanship, performance and exclusivity which are reflected in both companies' exclusive products.<br><br>Koga Miyata produces top-end bicycles both for the passionate amateur cyclist as well as for the professional racing cyclist. Its professional customers include many international World and Olympic champions.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">anyone willing to fork out the $$ to get this bike? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></div>
