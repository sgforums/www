            <div class='col-md body'>My gf and I had visited the Chevrolet roadshow at suntec last Thurs and was offered what we thought was a pretty fine deal. As I needed a car quite urgently for my job, we booked the car with the salesperson there as he mentioned that the offer given to us was limited (he offered to give us the pre-COE increase price).<br><br>He had verbally informed us that this is revokable and we believed him and signed the sales agreement, thinking we could still change our mind and at most lose the $88 booking fee. On that weekend, we dropped by another chevrolet showroom with our parents for a test drive and they didn't like the car. I then called the agent that I would like to cancel the agreement. He mentioned that he would speak to his 'boss' first.<br><br>I called him on Mon again and he informed that he had spoken to his boss and there would be a penalty of $2000 if we were to cancel. This was never mentioned to us and we thought it was revokable? I was prepared to lose the $88 but this? Of course I was infuriated. He explained that there is an opportunity cost to reserve the car and I thought my $88 bucks would cover for this already.<br><br>Can any one help to advise on this? We're thinking of taking this up to CASE but somehow feel it can be resolved more amicably. Agent refused to allow us to cancel unless we pay the penalty. We have yet to send in any income docs and there isn't anything processed yet. Dunno why the agent is so insistent as the car is not confirmed without a loan. Our main mistake was to sign the agreement.<br><br>Any help or advice would be really appreciated. Many thanks in advance to all here.</div>
