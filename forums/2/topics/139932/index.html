Road outside jam.  Buses going into interchange also jam.<br>Everything jam.<br><br>That's why they decided to let people pay when going in and then come out no barrier, just drive out.  So change 1 out lane to in lane.  Which is 3 lanes going into carpark and 1 lane going out instead of the 2 and 2 in the first place.<br><br>And this is using cash card, which is one of the first carpark to implement cashcard payment. Then carpark jam again because a lot of cash card no money.  They got to station a guard to help people top up cash card.<br><br>Then they happy happy change to the current ERP system kind and so change charges.  And i think their charges for parking is on the high side for a neighbourhood shopping center.<br><br>They used to charge $1 per entry before 5pm and $2 per entry after 5pm.<br>Then now that day i was there like 2 hours plus and got charged $4.80...<br>and they have no sign saying that they change the parking system and no time to go read small wordings because got car behind me...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got pros n cons la... Pros is that turnover of the cars will be faster now that the parking charges are more ex. Thus easier to find a lot... Simillar to Causeway Point. $1 for first hour and 50c for subsequent half hour even for wkends... thus never have a problem finding a lot there... But i must admit that the parking rate is a bit on the high side.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
