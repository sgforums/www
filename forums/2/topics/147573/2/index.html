The interior of the Mazda 3 is well thought of. intergrated console system for the radio and CD. nice knobs and switches for the aircon etc.Well thought of and build.<br><br>The Maz3 also has steptronic or auto shift.pretty gd for the driving enthusiant.But one thing that turn many people off is the lack of engine power from the engine.The build quality and level of finishing is pretty gd.<br><br>The Ford Focus.Very gd build and steering.The car made in germany,assembled in Spain, with the exception of the white color which is build and assembled in Germany. The feel and build is solid.Dials and knobs have expensive touch and feel.More driver oriented console as compared to the Maz3. Its handling and steering capabilities has been vastly improved and for $78,900, u get ABS and ESP. Not to mention Regent Motors are pushing for a promotion where they will absorb $800 worth of installment every mth for 6 mths.  So therefore u will save up another $4,800 on the focus.<br><br>Megane Hatch.Very daring concept. But you might want to consider the lack of boot space if u need to lug huge stuff.The megane has a whole lot of features and sensors mostly found on high end cars. Refridgerated glove comparment,parking sensors,climate senors.keyless entry,card ignition,6 airbags steering wheel mounted radio and CD buttons and much more.<br>For the price of the megane. its a whole bargain. the workmanship gd,quality materials used, and the very unique areoplane inspired handbrake.<br><br>But i had got frens who bought the megane sedan,and within 2-3 mths. the keyless entry fails, engine fails to start,loss of power during reversing.So the megane is still trying to sort of these problems.I might be blasting the megane,but the ppl i noe who had bought the megane are facing such problems.</div>

The Maz3 is more everyday.The Focus is very sharp and entertaining.Especially if your a driving freak or just loves a family car which can double as a weekend racer.Not to mention the Focus has a automatic,sports and adaptive setup.<br><br>The sports setup increase the revs to 6,500 before shifting, lowers and stiffen the suspension and once u turn off the ESP, fun begins. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>The adaptive driving mode allows the car to react to the driver's drivinghabits.Its almost like its able to detect if its your wife or mother driving and try to adapt the car accordingly.<br><br>Why u want to change the steering wheel ? its meaty and ergonomic enough.The same goes for the Maz3.<br><br>Well i am not very fussy abt the anteena as long it recevies the channels i want well.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>lets put it this way.For $5,000 more,u get a german engineered and manfacturerd car.A driver oriented car.that has 5 stars during the 2005 Euro NCap tests.Sporty yet subtle stance, always ready to be turned into a joyride when u want it to.</div>

Further deflated by the current car sales boom.So i don't really think its just the sudden drop due to it being a Ford. well i might be wrong as i just returned home from Australia.But thats how i preceive the current car market as.</div>
