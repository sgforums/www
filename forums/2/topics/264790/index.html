            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I'm pretty new here so hopefully someone can give me some much appreciated advice. I am going to start my Uni Education next yr. Due to the fact that I prefer not to stay in hall and my house is very far from sch, I was thinking of buying a car. It should be preferably paid for by myself. Minimal sponsorship from parents. Judging from my tuition assignments, I can hit about 1k per month hopefully. I was thinking of either getting an off peak car or a cheap 2nd hand car. An off peak car would mean I must reach sch before 7 and leave after 7pm. But if i need to give tuition on weekdays after sch, then there might be some difficulties. Another option is a 2nd hand car. I've done a lil bit of research online and in the forums. A 15 yr old BMW costs bout 20k for example. A v old Toyota costs bout maybe 12k. Can anyone experienced kindly tell me if there are any hidden costs or fees that I should know about and what are the disadvantages of getting a 2nd hand car.<br>Thanks in advance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm. Sorry but what do you mean by no point? haha. I just need a car to drive around for bout 4-5 yrs. Hopefully when I grad and find a job I can buy a new car. The reason why I'm not going for picanto and QQ is 1) I don't like hatchbacks and their appearance.2) even at 30+k, the budget is too high for me to cope I think.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>read that the corolla '92 AE101 1.6L manual is a reliable n sturdy car.. COE til 2011, abt juz nice for u..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  COE try not to go for auto car as i tink most of them are dying and to replace them cost a bomb..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>normally people plan for COE car is prepare abt $2k for initial wear and tear replacement immediately after drive off.. ( engine mounting, new oil n coolant replacement, aircon topup gas if the compressor still kicking..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> check the spark plugs, wires, bulbs, tires. brake pads etc.. )<br><br>but of cos it's best u go with a experience mechanic u can trust and help u haf a rough evaluation of the car.. or if the dealer allows, u can send the car for inspection..</div>

Believe me, there's more than enough things for u to worry in university. Unless ur pap is rich, or u really have the $$, there's no need and no point in getting a car. My friend from NTU lives in Sengkang and spends 3 hrs a day on travelling. He says he's already adapted to his 'travelling' lifestyle. He slps on the train to recoup his energy so that he can study at home.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my advice (since you're soliciting) is pls.... use public transport. studying in uni is.... TIRING. NO JOKE really. Been there done that. You're going to study, don't spend all your time giving tuition. You can FAIL. Is not a sure pass situation. You need to put in the effort.<br><br>after a tiring day, hop onto bus/mrt, and SLEEP. or enjoy the time chatting with ur frens. let the driver worry about traffic jam and parkings.<br><br>the older the car you get, the more the repair and maintenance. i would rather you spend the $$ staying in hall.<br><br>congrats to your entry to uni.</div>
