            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I also quite puzzled why they always put POA..but I guess it's because whoever have the money to buy a Ferrari/Lamborghini won't even bother about it's price much..and so the dealers don't bother to put a price..just put POA.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a pretty good idea of how much some exotic supercars in Singapore cost.  Let's start with the Ferrari F430 F1.  About $780,000.  It's rival, the Lamborghini Gallardo is $830,000 depending on various options.  The Bentley Continental GT  (2 doors 6litre V12 Twin turbo) is $710,000.  Aston Martin V8 (the baby version of DB9) is $600,000.  DB9 $730,000 I think.  High end Mercedes like the SL55 AMG with kompressor is $570,000.  Even higher end SL65 V12 twin turbo is estimated to be almost $800,000!  The latest Ferrari 599 V12 is around 1.1mil now with full options.  Even then waiting list is more than 12 months.
