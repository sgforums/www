The engine will have to fit the engine bay, an uprated engine must still be able to remain within the operating temperature range, and there are all sorts of praticalities to consider before u decide to make a car faster, such as ease of maintenance etc. So any mods would not be official because with the car, Gordon n McLaren have met the targets they set out when they 1st conceived the project. For the car to go faster, it will either be a special race project for things like GT series, or modifications in the private hands of wealthy owners.</div>

Up till more recently, their focus were on Formula 1. The McLaren F1 was conceived as a showcase and celebration of the company's design expertise and heritage in motorsports. And even then, im sure not many of you know this: the mclaren F1 was only conceived because of a delayed flight. The concept for the car was thought up back around 1990. Ron Dennis, Gordon Murray, Mansour Ojjeh and someone else whom I can't remember now, were on a flight back after a Formula 1 race. The flight got delayed and thus the 4 of them sat around in the departure lounge, and after a while, the idle chat got around to the topic of making a roadcar to celebrate the company's heritage and showcase their expertise. And that, was the start of the idea for the McLaren F1. The rest, as they say, is history.<br><br>Anyways today, McLaren's company structure is diverse. There is the parent company McLaren Group, which comprises all the smaller McLaren companies. These companies are:<br><br><strong>McLaren Racing</strong><br><br>McLaren Racing, the company behind Team McLaren Mercedes, was formed in 1980 following the merger of Team McLaren and Project Four, Ron Dennis' racing company. Operating in the highly competitive and technological environment of Formula One, McLaren Racing comprises a multitude of administrative and engineering departments, ranging from vehicle design and aerodynamics, to Materials Science and the paint shop.<br><br><strong>McLaren Automotive</strong><br><br>McLaren Automotive was created in 2003, formally bringing together under one name the companies previously known as McLaren Cars and McLaren Composites.<br><br>McLaren Automotive has two sites, one at Portsmouth and the other at the McLaren Technology Centre. The Portsmouth site operates as a world player in the design and manufacture of advanced composites, and is involved in production of the complex body shell of the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren programme.<br><br>The site at the McLaren Technology Centre incorporates the state-of the art production line for the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. Production of the car began in 2003.<br><br><strong>McLaren Marketing</strong><br><br>McLaren Marketing was formed in 1987, primarily to service the marketing and media requirements of McLaren Racing. The company's role has constantly evolved to serve the growing needs of other companies within and outside the McLaren Group, and McLaren Marketing now consists of eight groups working in concert: Business Development; Creative; Hospitality; Media and Communications; Special Projects, Filming and Photographic; Finance; Partner Management and Partner Programmes.<br><br><strong>McLaren Electronic Systems</strong><br><br>McLaren Electronic Systems develops and manufactures automotive control systems for many different motor sport series, including Formula One, World Rally and Le Mans. Its wide range of products and components are utilised by nearly 100 customers world-wide, including sales to most of the cars on the Formula One grid.<br><br>The company provides the complete automotive control system used by the Team McLaren Mercedes team to deliver the optimum performance available from the engine and chassis. McLaren Electronic Systems has a team of over 100 highly qualified engineers and skilled technicians.<br><br><strong>McLaren Applied Technologies</strong><br><br>McLaren Applied Technologies Limited was formed in 2004 and is the latest company within the McLaren Group.<br><br>The primary objective of the company is to work within a diverse range of industries and develop commercial applications for technology developed within the McLaren Group.<br><br>Additionally, McLaren Applied Technologies will provide an internal central resource for certain key facilities and expertise to ensure that each McLaren business gets maximum use and value from the GroupÂ’s investment in new technology.<br><br><strong>Lydden Circuit Limited</strong><br><br>Lydden Circuit Limited is the freehold owner of a racetrack and other adjoining land at Lydden, near Dover, UK. The track is currently leased by LCL to the British Motorcycle Racing Club.<br><br><strong>Absolute Taste</strong><br><br>Absolute Taste provides fresh food and stylish hospitality for the Team McLaren Mercedes Formula One team throughout the grand prix season. A passion for food, service and style creating private parties and corporate events for a prestigious client list has also established their reputation as one of LondonÂ’s most sought after creative catering and event design companies.<br><br>Absolute Taste Inflight is the latest division of the company with a new, innovative approach to in-flight hospitality for executive jets recreating Absolute TasteÂ’s food and style of service for clients travelling around the world.<br><br>Until recently, Tag McLaren Audio was also part of this group. Now I believe it belongs to the International Audio Group(IAG), when McLaren International sold it to them. IAG are the people who manufacture the prestigious audiolab brand of high end hi-fi products, as well as Wharfedale audio products. On a side note, Im getting a Wharfdale TV this xmas!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
