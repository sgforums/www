              <p>Yes, It is common nowadays for impatient car drivers to drive their cars over the pedestrain crossings, while there are still pedestrain passing and the pedestrain lights are still green.

              <p>He instead of slowing down stepped down on the accelerator and increased the speed of the car. Thankfully I jumped out of his way in time. Otherwise, who knows I might have lost one of my limps due to someone else's impatience.</p>

              Ah beng or not, a life has been lost. No matter how idiotic a person is, we shouldn't take joy in such a terrible accident. I simply don't know what kinda perverse mentality people have nowadays, either wish the car got scratched or die...

              <p>what i mean is those just park without causing obstructionl, to do a quick errand like dropping a letter into the post box or to pickup lunch or to throw rubbish into a bin.. these kinda few minutes job. All this also need to park and put coupon, the carparks will lagi jam and petrol will be used up more quickly sia...</p>

              <p>that is bad... A few years ago something similiar incident happened to a mother and son couple crossing the road infront of my place. Only difference is they were not as lucky. The dad must have been left a very lonely man after that. Lost his newly set up family just like that.</p>

              <p>what the f*ck?</p>
              <p>have any of you ever driven on the road?</p>
              <p>its precisely these careless and reckless drivers that cause all
              the accidents on the road. IMHO, these drivers do not deserve
              sympathy.</p>
              <p>when they take risk by speeding, not only are they at risk,
              every other safe driver is at risk too.</p>
              <p>a car is a means of transport, not a speeding tool.</p>

              <p>Actually I think according to Singapore law drivers are not supposed to drive their car across the pedestrain path when the pedestrain lights are green especially there a still any pedestrains on the path. It is an offence in law actually. But it seems more and more of them are bending the law. Which is rather unfair as it is at the expense of pedestrains like us.</p>

              <p>But on the safe side, I guess we just have to take precaution....</p>
