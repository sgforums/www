Parf is the amount you take back when your car is up to 10 yrs old. OMV normally comes in if you scraped your car prematurely.<br><br>2) As explained in point one, it does affect when come to scrapping of car and when sell off.<br><br>3) Depends on which model. Maybe you can check the market rate lor. Or alternatively, can let us know the price and model of the car. I'm sure many pple here are more than willing to help.<br><br>4) That, you'll know when test drive. Most importantly is to make sure the car is accident free by checking a few things like ....ermmm forget what the thing is call, 'structure' of the car under the bonnet. If accident before color sure will be a bit diff or newer etc. If not, easiest way is to get some expert friend to help.<br><br>5) Really depends on what you like. Too many ard. but then more importantly, work within your budget. My neighbour bought a 1.5 yrs old Impreza TS  bug eye series at 57k. !st hand abt 75k then i believe, so one yr save abt 12k! Maybe car like this will help.</div>

Cheers!<br><br></div></blockquote>You are mostly correct. The old system whereby PARF rebate is based on a percentage of the OMV is for vehicles registered before May 2002.<br><br>After that, it is mainly based on your ARF, 130% of OMV for between May 2002 to March 2004 registered cars and 110% for March 2004 onwards. This reduces the fixed up-front cost of car ownership. However the PARF rebate, as mentioned earlier, is based on a percentage of the ARF. Since there is a reduction of ARF, the PARF automatically reduces too.<br><br>example:<br><br>Case 1(&lt;5 years)<br>For vehicles registered between May 02 to Mar 04:<br>PARF rebate = 75% * ARF(=130%*OMV)<br>= 97.5% of OMV<br>For vehicles registered Mar 04 onwards:<br>PARF rebate = 75% * ARF(=110%*OMV)<br>= 82.5% of OMV (This is what you refer to as the 17.5% gone)<br><br>Last Case(9-10 years)<br>For vehicles registered between May 02 to Mar 04:<br>PARF rebate = 50% * ARF(=130%*OMV)<br>= 65% of OMV<br>For vehicles registered Mar 04 onwards:<br>PARF rebate = 50% * ARF(=110%*OMV)<br>= 55% of OMV<br><br>The cases in between is obtained by a decrement of 5% from case 1 to the last case.<br><br>Hope this helps!</div>

But some dun have price listed, can call to ask, then later compare lo.<br>To know if the car is in good condition, one simple way is to check the mileage. Above 25,000km per year then the engine has been over-used.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> Car may break down easily.<br>For more tips, can refer to here: <a href="http://www.sgcarmart.com/articles/used_buying_guide.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgcarmart.com/articles/used_buying_guide.php</a></div>
