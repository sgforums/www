I think I can find more accidents happening in expressways even if one is driving normally. The fault doesn't lie with you, but it's the other person to blame. So what? Accidents still can happen no matter who's fault it is. Not just "street racers" wannabes, to normal road users too.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by sillyme:<strong>though you mentioned that they are hazardous for a short moment.. at the same time disasters can happen if one loses a second of concentration..</strong></blockquote>Yes... tatz a big IF. When one is driving at tat kind of speed, could one lose concentration?? Yes, but hardly. Wat kind of "losing concentration?? Sleep?? ha ha!! No way, brother. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Wat kind of disaster can one do on only a straight road?? None. If tat "racer" can accident also on the straight road, I best suggest he just give up this "hobby", and go chiong ICE instead, or lose his life. I believe those "racers" dun install those good brakes like "brembo" for nothing, right?<br><br>But if one hits a jaywalker, the jaywalker deserves it. Wat are the predestrian crossings used for? Government build them there for fun?(I believe I'm going to get a lot of flames for this, bring it on) If the presdestrians wan safe passage, dun jaywalk. If they jaywalk and kana hit by vehicle, may god bless your soul. Not the driver's fault.<br><br>A jaywalker is no different from the racers wannabes. Wan excitment, you have to take the risk.<br><br>Once again, no offends.<br><br>Cheerz!! Itz Tiger Time!!</div>
