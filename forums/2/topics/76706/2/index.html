But if he is driving on a windy road or on the track 160km/h is quite fast and the amount of concentration is very tiring and taxing..... In addition, the engine capacity also plays an important part..... if u take a suzuki 1.3 to 160km/h the feeling is very scary cos u will feel everything like falling apart.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> But you dun feel much if ur vehicle is 3L and above.....

            <div class='col-md body'>bro boo. I can tell u again, that it is very easy to lose concentration on the road, while racing.<br>here... let me ttell u where i just went today...<br>I spent the whole day at SGH.<br>a good friend of mine... warded there.<br>he got involved in a head on collision.<br>the story is like that: Saturday morning, after a night of pool and makan at marina south, he and some friends were heading home. due to the late hour, he was feeling a bit tired. so he drove rather slower than usual, about 50km/h. As his car approached a bend, he suddenly saw headlights coming at him. And thats all he remembers. An idiot, driving a normal car, was playing a bit, racing with his friend in an WRX. He was driving about 120km/h estimates the police.(not even your 160km/h which u consider nothing) he turned the corner, and while exiting the corner, he went into the opposite lane, right into my friend's car. Head on collision. both cars totalled. my friend's face is all swollen now, looking very sad, lips swollen and broken, deep cut on his chin, where the jaw bone was actually exposed, and he can't eat and can barely drink. on nutrient drip now... left arm and right leg fractured... can't walk, can't use his arms, cannot even go to the toilet... had to be catherized. can't talk properly either. his gf luckily... only had the internal bruising caused by the seat belt... he stuck his left arm out to protect her... thus preventhing her head from hitting anything, but breaking it in e process. He is in great pain now. when the nurse jacked his bed up for him to take his medication, his eyes actually teared.<br><br>I feel heartbroken just looking at him, as do many of his other friends feel. Why? because some bastard who can't drive for nuts wanted to race... didn't know the limits... didn't concentrate n went into the oppo lane... my friend is in this horrible state not of his choosing. he is in this state now because some Asshole choose to take a risk, and because that Asshole cannot think properly... my friend has to suffer now.<br><br>And thats not all. the Asshole... was not badly injured... because he had an air bag... his gf... in the passenger side... didn't she got very badly injured. and this FUCK, ran away after the accident... leaving his badly injured gf at the scene without even showing any concern for her... my friend... after the accident... was stumbling around covered in blood... and he was shouting where his gf was... how is she... and only when he ascertained that she was fine... did he pass out. The FUCKER who caused the accident.... ran off... leaving his badly injured gf to die... and the FUCKER in the WRX racing with him... helped him run away by letting him into the car... Well now the whole thing is a police case. The driver has already been caught. He is 100% guilty. My friend's family are getting ready to sue the pants off him. they are going to make sure this prick is never let on the roads again, and that he will pay till his pants come off. so bro boo... do reconsider your attitude towards such on the road activities... because... u never know... when it is your turn to cause such unnecessary suffering to a fellow human being.</div>
