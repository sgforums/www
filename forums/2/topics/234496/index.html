            <div class='col-md body'>Sabotage? That's a fact, I was slaughtered $130 per tyre for Yokohama db A500. You call Comfort Auto and check, higher range Yokohama ES501 only $105 per tyre.<br><br>10000km thereafter free rotation and alignment, use nitrogen gas also. That Speed tyre boss "Dave" try to "wriggle" out and told me Confort Auto big organization, can order 100 to 200 pieaces so he can't fight on prices. Yet when I go to him he told me damn good price, better than outside .. got dragon got phoenix.  What bullshit is that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I am just notifying all car users to do their homework. Dun believe me? Go buy tyres from Speedtyres and feel like a fool (jux as I am now).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

U expect them to say, "hey, i think comfort auto selling much cheaper than my shop, i think u should check with them first."? Must be fair to them too, they are also doing business. No one forces u to buy ma.. Also, its ur bad for not doing ur homework well before purchasing.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Sliver's racing?

            <div class='col-md body'>What I am doing here is to relate my experience and give a word of warning. Yokohama DB A500 at $130 versus the better ES501 at $105, you think Speedway really made an honest claim that its a "good deal"? <strong>Sales technique is one thing, overcharging is another.</strong><br><br>I rest my case against those who think I am posting an ad or trying to sabotage others. Probably those are the ones who are cocky that they can do "good research" and never ever get over charged once before, and hence  prefer to give sacarstic remarks. Or perhaps, these are also evil sales ppl  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> who like to over charge other human beings for the sake of their own pocket. What comes round, goes round. You will be the next target.<br><br>I am not sure if Silver racing is related to Fong Kim arnot. If someone thinks i am making an ad, MODERATOR please feel free to remove my postings.<br><br>This shall be my last post for this thread. For all those who appreciated my postings, I thank you and hope you had become a smarter consumer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck to all.</div>
