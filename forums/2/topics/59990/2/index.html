            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dcx:</div><div class="quote_body">TP is all abt safety...the more "kia si" you're...the higher the chances of passing is higher...but of coz dun kia si to the extent that you drive at a speed of 30km/hr...muz check blind spots whenever you're going to lane changing, turns n every 5-10secs to check your mirrors...then chances of passing is abt tehre liaoz...and of coz your driving muz be ok lahz..cannot "si chia" too often lor..<br>gd luck</div></blockquote>yeah i agree bro. not showing off but i passed my Tp test with only 8 points and only once. but i've learned that in a test... its not only how good you drive but how safe you drive. Tp is actually alot easier than you think but its the stress and anxiousness that makes it hard. Just tell yourself its just someone you showing your driving. you must relax all the time, keep cool. dont gan chioong...even if you make mistakes...keep relax... TP can actually read your reactions due to many test they been thru.<br><br>Tips:<br>1. Blindspots are always the killer (4 points each)<br>2. E-brake (very dangerous killer... miss it.. and back to the center you go)<br>3. Check everything before you go start the test.. eg: mirrors, signals etc.<br>4. try to be polite and reply what they ask you to do eg: "yes, sir."<br>5. dress appropriately... well not too formal lah..aiyoh!<br>6. speed is another killer... lookout...<br>7. YELLOW BOX AND STOP LINE!!<br><br>ps: I have a fren who have over 22 points. but due to his politeness and well dress and versed... he passed (luck? maybe but take a chance) Confidence is the main thing...<br><br>GOOD LUCK TO ALL!! ALL THE BEST!!</div>

What if during your Tp test, the tester did the same thing...and you did what you did with ur instructor...man...it gonna cost you alot of points...8 points if im not wrong...

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm quite sure one important factor the testers look out for is the confidence of your driving on you test day. Look... by the time you're actually taking the test, even if itz your first time, you would have gone into circuit so many times, and covered the test routes at least twice right. I doesn't take much to overcome your nevousness after telling yourself you're using a familiar car... travelling on familiar roads, and driving around a stupid and boring circuit.<br><br>I totally agree that girls should wear short skirts... haha. But not too short... if the tester like what he sees... he might fail you to get another chance to see you again!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u know now i am thinking of getting a '2nd opinion'. i mean i want to change my driving instructor. i am not saying he's bad... but i merely want to know more opinions about my driving skills.<br><br>my instructor got scared when he heard that i want to take back my PDL and test fee fr him after 2 phonecalls today. (coz since last time's failure....he offered to help me register a date. and i just gave him my PDL and fee on the spot).<br><br>On the first phonecall, in my horror he said March 2004 is the next available date....becoz why??? he said he will be at overseas.the RIGHTFUL available dates are end of Jan 2004 and Feb 2004 (officially published online)....<br><br>I told him, I checked the website and comfort driving centre next available date is Feb 2004. He said it is not true. He insisted March. so i ended the call and brainstormed...<br><br>come to think of it, probably it is a good chance to gain a 2nd opinion...though i have to baleh get used to another car...but i have tolerated enuff of this instructor...<br><br>i called him again and told him that i want my pdl back...then he sensed sth fishy and beginning to brainwash me to stay with him...i told him i got a tight schedule next year as i am studying part time next yr....but he also have no choice lah...<br><br>the next thing he was abt to say really pissed me off! i hear him flipping thru his stuffs and he tells me now that Feb 2004 is available... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>i still remembered last time he told me: "It's your fault that I cant fit another student into the monday schedule!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>I am new to this forum. Share my experience in taking TP.<br>I learned my driving thru private instructor and every time kena suan. Said i slow in reaction, not safety... from start to end alway kena suan. Then near to my test date, he said he got another student who can drive dam well but fail (meaning i drive like shit, sure fail). Then worse on the day of my TP, i took a bus to meet him, warah alight the bus my head bang on the top portion of the door, thought this is a bad omen. My attitude towards TP is prepare to fail.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> , then start my TP.  Hope into the car,<br><br>Lesson 1 : Do all the necessary adjustment.<br>Lesson 2 : Drive inside the circuit, remember all the marking for a good execution of actions (S course, crank course..etc). During this period, must be a good actor, always turn ur head until like want to broke off, always signal.<br><br>Lesson 3 : On the road, tester tok kok with me. So i lan lan entertaint him. Tok Tok Tok and more Tok, Tok until his daughter (hahahahaa... )  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , Then on the road, try not to move so slow, must show some confident that you dare to drive normal like speed up to change gear, signal to change lane (just take it as you own the whole fucking world) but like i said, i prepare to fail. Then one U turn with bigger centre divider, i miss Q a bit , never return back to the outer lane, but told instructor the steering wheel bigger, so i not use to it.. kekeke... then back to the centre (with alot of Tok kok).<br>Tot fail cos of the U turn.. but surprise i passed.<br><br>Then meet my instructor, warah, first thing ask me ... fail ar..... @Q#$#$@^#$@#Q423523w........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Its an old belief. Put a iron nail and wrap it in newspaper. put it in your pocket and go for the test with it.<br><br>At 1st when my friend told me, I told him to go fly kite.
