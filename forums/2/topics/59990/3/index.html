            <div class='col-md body'>I took tp for six pathetic times over span of nearly 3 miserable years...<br><br>Took my advance theory twice cuz it expired... Extremely demoralising experience.<br><br>Don't give up. Just practice the road until you feel like lao jiao, cut lanes, u-turn, left,right turn like nobody's business.<br><br>Wrt circuit, don't book it everytime. Instead, you can save the time and money practicing parkings using your instructors poles, and after a while, make it eve tighter so you'll have to rely on your judgement even more. Practice man, but of course, my 4th and 5th time was killed by circuit cuz the latter was not done EDIT: and 2 of my previous testers were suspended due to complaints... so I I didn't have to please these jokers this time round <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
