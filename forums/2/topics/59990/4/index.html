He's getting good @ sarcasm &amp; i know that if i 'quit' he'll try 2 have the last say and try to make me fel stupid a.k.a if i quit, it'll make him feel like he wins and i <span style="font-style: italic;">dont </span>want him 2 tink that he wins.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I passed my driving test w 10 points. But it was on my 4th attempt.<br><br>Its important to get a good instructor who gives clear explanations and not just issue instructions.  My first instructor - not only called me "stupid" and said things like "EVERY DAY same old  mistake", he would not explain his instructions. When I asked for explanation, he would say "I'm the instructor.  You just listen to what I say".  So I had to draw my own conclusions from what he said.  When I flunked my first test, he laughed!!    He laughed harder when I failed the 2nd time.<br><br>I switched instructors one month before my next test.  My old instructor was very angry and told the new one that I failed because I'm stubborn and stupid, as the new instructor would find out for himself!  (I so sway one day driving lesson with new instructor met old instructor who blocked car, so that new instructor had to get out of car to talk to him!).  New instructor - face very stern.  Only time he smiled was when I passed.<br><br>But he was very encouraging and kept telling me "don't give up hope.  Each time you drive, you improve".  he explained his instructions and would ask me to repeat to make sure I understood.  He told me that I had to unlearn a lot of stuff and doubted that I would pass the test, just 1-mth away.  I said I would give it a try.  I got 30 points!  My instructor told me "good attempt.  The next one you will surely pass.  You just need a little more time".<br><br>Well I passed on my next attempt, 3 months later!  I said "finally, after 4 times" and he replied "Don't feel bad that you took so long to get the licence.  It helps to make you a better driver" - so encouraging.  He said there are some people who pass on their first attempt but because they only had a few months of driving lessons, they panick when they drive alone.<br><br>People told me that my driving is pretty good and I don't drive like new driver.  i say, yah wat, 4 attemps, wat so new?!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Ok, sorry for this long story.  the gist of it is - perservere!  You will get your licencse and all this time of extra instructions is a big help in giving you confidence on the road when you drive alone.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Passed on the fifth attempt. Not to discourage anyone or anything, just be presistent and never give up. You give up = you waste time + money.<br><br>Like what the other people said, drive carefully and practice alot until you are confident. What testers want to see :<br><br>1. Confidence(not driving recklessly mind you)<br>2. Try to complete circuit without demerits<br>3. Check the mirrors(Just check the mirrors, be kia-su a bit)<br>4. Chose a good time where there are less cars on the road<br>5. Be very alert and watch for dangers or hazards<br><br>This is as much as I can think of. Good luck to your tests!! Remember, don't give up!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Passed on third attempt 10 years back.  Don't be discourage, try and try again.<br><br>Main thing is all instructors and tp testers always look for safety driving habits you possess during driving.  So be sure that is one of the top piority you should build up.<br><br>Just have a clear mind what are the procedures when doing the circuit and be positive and stay focus.  Run thru the procedures b4 the test helps too, but don't panick.  You never know, you may just pass even if you felt you did badly and sure to fail on that day.<br><br>Be positive, you can get back your inspiration to pass by looking at yourself driving a car of your own.  Oh! And never argue with the instructors and testers, you will be black listed somehow. Good luck !!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Just 3 weeks before my 2nd test, I drove everyday, and on the test day itself, I went through the circuit twice. So practice makes perfect.
