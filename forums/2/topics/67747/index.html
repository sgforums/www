But I think I should have gotten a 180sx instead hehe. Still reckon the 00' design is the best maybe a MX model.<br><br>Hrmm, in rgds to the 300ZX I really dun recc it, the engine compartment is extremly compact, 1 slight hit and some parts usually get hammered.

But I'm not sure if policies differ from company to company but it was RAC at the time.<br><br>Funny thing was when I called a few times to get a quote a different person would qoute me a different amount heh really strange so I made a few calls and picked the cheapest option  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> that too was RAC F.Y.I, I manage to get it insured for $1600 (1st yr) then 1400 or 1200  subsequently,<br><br>Hrmm, If your car is in a locked garage the insurance should give you a lower qoute by right, maybe you like to consider insuring under ur bf? but better off to get a qoute first and calculate the difference.<br><br>Ah yea that was a older model 180, but when compared against the lancer it flies  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> , actually anything compared to a stock 1.5 flies hehe too bad I had to sell my lancer away, I really missed the handling on that car heh, hope the new caucasian chick will take good care of her for me   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
