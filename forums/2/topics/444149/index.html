              <p>Need advice. </p>
              <p>I was driving along 1st lane at abt 60km/h when I saw a car ahead on right side going to  make a u-turn. The driver did not stop n went beyond his white "give way" lines. But when the driver saw my car, it stopped but his car has already intruded into my lane n no way I could swift to 2nd lane as there were other cars. I jam brake immediately but my car still skidded n hit a part of his left front door. It was dented n scratched. My right bumper oso got scratched badly and it was out of alightment. </p>
              <p>Being a newbie for accidents, both parties didn't know what to do. We drove to the side n I began to snap pics of his licence n both damages. He was apologetic n said he didn't see my car coming n both of us agree to let insurance co. to handle. </p>
              <p>I called my insurer n they advised me to go back Volvo as my car is still under warranty, otherwise it could void my warranty. Volvo quoted me $3.x for repairs. The other car is a Lexus. </p>
              <p> For my repairs, I m claiming from my own insurer. Then after that Volvo will issue a lawyer's letter to the other driver's insurer to claim the repair n the excess cash that I paid.</p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">Do you think it is clearly his fault n I could claim 100% from his insurance co.? </span></p>

              <p>Only after that, should you shift your vehicles to the side of the road.</p>
              <p>Now that you haven't done that, the other party can turn around hitting you with a "NEW SCENERIO" accusing you that you hit him.</p>

              <p>That what insurance company normally will do. Claim you, yourselves, your insurance then fight the case. If win, they return the $$$ to your insurance company and your NCD will not be affected.</p>
              <p>Coz if u wanna wait till after they settle the case, claim insurance and then repair your car. It can take week or month. U will be out of transport for that time. Which is not adviseable.</p>

              <p>If slightly dented just replace the parts and paint the damage parts. Ya 100% claim</p>
              <p>But if a badly damage. Insurance company might shout total lost. Which means the claim is more then the value of your car. Is not a 100% claim. Check with your insurance. I not sure if this (total lost) include in the third party claim.</p>
