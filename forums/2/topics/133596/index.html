A higher OMV meant a slightly higher scrap value which makes resellability a problem when the buyer compares this to the deck-low prices of the new car prices. My friend's 2002 VTi which has a 130% OMV was deemed too high in terms of scrap value so dealer can't afford to take in and resell. In the end, it was traded-in to be de-reg for export; worthing only 4k above its scrap value...</strong><br><br>3) good FC<br><br>CON<br>1) car shall be hitting a mileage which require you to change timing belt?<br><br><strong>Toyota Engines do not have timing belts. VVTi uses Timing Chain that do not require replacement at regular intervals.</strong><br><br>2) wear and tear starts to surface:  tyres, brake pads/disc etc as warranty going to end<br><br>3) higher interest rate (3.125%)<br><br>New Cerato/Matrix ($51999/$5188<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>PRO<br>1) smell of new car<br><br>2) warranty<br><br><strong>For the Cerato, the 100,000km warranty comes with the most expensive servicing charges by C&amp;C so u may like to take note of it...</strong><br><br>3) lower interest rate<br><br>CON<br>1) heavy car thus FC higher<br><br><strong>Yes. The Matrix weighs 1260kg while the Cerato weighs 1274kg. In contrast, the Civic weighs 1160kg, the Altis 1175kg, the Lancer 1085kg, the City 1090kg and the Vios 980kg. Naturally becos of its weight, it will bring you to the kiosk more often than jap car owners...</strong><br><br>2) lower scrap value as COE is low and 55% OMV<br><br><strong>As mentioned above, got good got bad. The Parf will continue to decline with the decrement of the ARF imposed on new cars; Question is which FY will the government implement that. In the long run, car owners of 55% OMV scrap system will still lugi somehow... </strong><br><br>3) poor resale value of Korean cars in the market<br><br><strong>Agreed. Look at Hyundai advertises its car every sat in the classified. They kept slashing prices like nobody's business. At this rate u may get to c a 45k price tag for a 1.6L Matrix by end of the year (provided COE continues its current trend). There is absolutely zero points for customer loyalty as those who had bought Hyundai cars see their cars depreciating faster than continental cars... The dealer is solely interested to keep its current 2nd best seller position while striving for the 1st so volume counts. </strong><br></blockquote><strong></strong></div>

So if the owner directly scrap to scarp dealers he would most probably get ard 48k. If u buy from dealers then add 5k. So the price we are looking at is around 53k if get from dealer. Get direct from owner would be 48k like that. At 53k u r just 9k short of paying for a brand new Altis instead. This is the dilemma that I was trying to say earlier on that a high OMV may not necessarily work to our advantage. Now u know wat I mean?<br><br>The transfer fee of is capped at 2% of the mkt price for the car. In this case, the so-call mkt price of the car is its current scrap value which I believe should be $37,500. Therefore 2% of it would be $750. This amount of $ goes to the government coffers so no choice if u want a car, u pay the price.<br><br>It's very impt to keep your cool and be impartial in your judgement when buying the car. No doubt it makes economical sense to go for a new korean car as compared to a 2nd hand jap car, the fact remains that we are not comparing apple to apple here. Even if its a new korean car, eventually 2 or 3 years down the road u will start to tink twice...<br><br></div>

At the price of $52K, the COE is about $17K. If the car is going to scrap in 3 and 5 years time, the paper value will only cost $21.8K and $18.4K respectively (sorry, but Korea cars really dun fetch any body price currently). Anyone selling the ride off early will definitely cry big times unless he pay at least 30% d/p.<br><br>Likewise for a 2 yo G9, the current scrap (less body) is $38K. At its 3rd year and 5th year, it will have a rebate of $33.3K and $28K respectively. On paper, you own a second hand car for about 2 years and scrap, you wun lost much.<br><br>I'm quite concern about the rebate values of cars in future, so it is rather dilemma to choose on new Korean car or a G9.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>$52,000 to $55,000 for a 2 year old Corolla is the market rate. Can check it out from here:<br><a href="http://www.sgcarmart.com/main/listing.php?MOD=corolla&amp;CAP=Any&amp;PR1=0&amp;PR2=&amp;TP=Any&amp;GR=Any&amp;FR=2003&amp;TO=2003" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgcarmart.com/main/listing.php?MOD=corolla&amp;CAP=Any&amp;PR1=0&amp;PR2=&amp;TP=Any&amp;GR=Any&amp;FR=2003&amp;TO=2003</a><br><br>With some skilful negotiations, can probably bring it down to $50,000.<br><br>Resale value of Toyota is definately much better than Korean cars. If you are planning to change your car 2-3 years down the road, go for the Corolla!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SeeTees:</div><div class="quote_body">If the scrap is 38k then add ard 10k for the body. So if the owner directly scrap to scarp dealers he would most probably get ard 48k. If u buy from dealers then add 5k. So the price we are looking at is around 53k if get from dealer. Get direct from owner would be 48k like that. At 53k u r just 9k short of paying for a brand new Altis instead. This is the dilemma that I was trying to say earlier on that a high OMV may not necessarily work to our advantage. Now u know wat I mean?<br><br>The transfer fee of is capped at 2% of the mkt price for the car. In this case, the so-call mkt price of the car is its current scrap value which I believe should be $37,500. Therefore 2% of it would be $750. This amount of $ goes to the government coffers so no choice if u want a car, u pay the price.<br><br>It's very impt to keep your cool and be impartial in your judgement when buying the car. No doubt it makes economical sense to go for a new korean car as compared to a 2nd hand jap car, the fact remains that we are not comparing apple to apple here. Even if its a new korean car, eventually 2 or 3 years down the road u will start to tink twice...<br><br></div></blockquote>all this scrap/paper/depreciation thing is making me a bit confused...can someone explain in layman language what it's all about?</div>
