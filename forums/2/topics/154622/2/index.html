To let a friend without license to drive your car.<br><br>I believe your friend is likely to get his ban extended, maybe for another 2 years or so, because he already has a bad driving record.<br><br>as for you, you better pray hard. You might want to argue that you were so sick that day that you cant think properly and that is why you made such a irrational decision to let your friend drive.<br><br>In any case, you should have just taken a cab. good luck!!<br></div>

Drank-driving alone is enough to cause be fined and such, no-license driving much more worse....... WAIT! Which country is that?

No matter whether his suspension is past or not, he is driving without a licence.

Cause that is his car. He allow a non-licensed person to drive his car, that could amount to an offence. Unless he can prove he unknowningly let his friend drive.</div>
