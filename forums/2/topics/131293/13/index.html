            <div class='col-md body'>Hey saj,<br>dun ask me why I'm still awake at this hour...<br><br>I'm currently using the mirage package on my OPC, great performance in terms of keeping the heat out...can really feel the diff compared to cars with no solar film. Mine is normally parked outside the whole day, but when I come home in the evening abt 6 plus, I dun feel any heat from inside the car when I open the door. Also the film is nicely tinted yet remains within LTA guidelines. Verdict: Good!<br><br>If I'm not wrong, mystique package is not LTA compliant, and uv clear package doens't have much tinting.<br><br>Btw heard frm a friend that rikecool (he got it free with his Kia) is practically useless, hope nobody opts for that brand. Also huper optik is on par with vkool, and both are from the same parent company haha!</div>
