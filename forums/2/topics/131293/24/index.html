Went to JB in the morning and was caught in the jam for 2 hours in the afternoon. I think the JB trip is workable especially if we drive in a group and avoid those 'ulu' places there....Yong Peng town is also a good place to makan....The fishball noodles there are rather famous and they have plenty of durians now.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Toadie,<br><br>I have installed the 3M film, and tried leaving the car out in the sun for 1 hour.. (i didn't have a choice anyway!). I still feel the heat, but later, i realised that it is because in front, in the driver's seat, the front film of course has lesser IR reduction compared to the back, which was much cooler.<br><br>But, it is definitely better, as the heat dissipated much faster then before, after the engine &amp; aircon is switched on! So, all in all, quite happy with it and the customised mats.<br><br>48 hours after installation, the rear window film makes everything looks distorted, so i had to drive carefully (cars behind me looked like many lambourghinis &amp; ferraris!!), but, now, it is fine, though the demister lines are now more prominent then before..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Saj,<br><br>Glad that you are happy with 3M. Have to watch the distortion tho', will see your car and then comment.  Also you are right about demister, it's because they cut strips over the demister rather than a full piece, I think.  Also heat gets into your car by IR and also by hothousing, unless you leave a gap in your windows. Will check your tailor made mat when we meet. Thanks<br><br>Toadie</div>
