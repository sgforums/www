            <div class='col-md body'>Madagascar,<br><br>What is a door visor?<br><br>I drove a car some years back with window visors. I assume they are those plastic things you wedge on top of the window on the outside. If you wind down your windows slightly, some air/wind will come into the car to cool it without disrupting your hairdo. Am I correct?<br><br>If so I feel its a waste of time as the 'air' coming into the window is quite warm and will do little to cool the car. Further they make a lot of wind noise and cause unnecessary wind friction. This is the biggest disadvantage. This works well in cold countries as the outside air is cold and is just suitable to cool the interior. Its like driving a convertible in Sgp. Further if the quality is poor the plastic will discolour with age, otherwise it is just another example of a cosmetic mod.<br><br>As for my experience I never used it and did not bother as it came with the car, even when it was raining. Hope this is useful.<br><br>Toadie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey saj, discussed the mileage issue in the forum b4, think the general fc ranges from like 11-15km/l... (anyone correct me if wrong)... depend on the grade of petrol u use as well... i usually pump 98 or the esso red color, 5000?, ard 32-34 litres and it easily last me over 400km, max record 500km!!! or maybe you that type rev up engine when the traffic turns green, think very eat petrol...<br><br>btw, petrol discount yesterday at 24%!! today still 23%!!! goodness...</div>

I was the only Marchie among the Cefiros, Primeras, Sunnys, etc. but thankfully, my Marchie did not fail me and I managed to keep up in pace with most of these cars.
