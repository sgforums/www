            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all ,<br><br>Yesterday we were given a  very comprehensive talk covering the new generation aluminium engines vs the older cast iron engines. That included the 2 stage cooling systems in our engine vs the older single stage cooling systems. We also learnt about how the IPDM communicates with the ECU systems and how if we intend to mod our cars for greater performance, we should ensure the compliance with the control specs of the ECU diagnostics. We were given tips also on how to advance the timing of the ignition spark from 4 to 0.4 degrees TDC. The importance of the link between the IPDM and ECU was further emphasised in that we were told of their inter-relation and inter-connections should we add on any items like DVD players, GPS systems, ionisers, HID lamps and even car fridges for our long-haul travellers.<br><br>We were even shown the plans for the electrical circuitry for the new Marches vs the old K11.That was very enlightening.<br><br>Next we covered the suspension systems, front and rear, leaf, elliptical, independent and how they integrated with the wheels, toe-in, toe-out, camber positive, camber negative, straight and non-straight circular spring shock absorbers. If I am not mistaken we covered also ERBD, ABS for brakes, ABS for air-bags, TCS, IPDM, ECU, HID lamps.<br><br>I know we covered many topics, too many for me to remember but I certainly remembered the 2 cakes baked by Faded Mango. That was super. Hey, how about another super Mango sponge cake for our next talk?<br><br>As if that was not sufficient, we also went home with an assortment of goodies, t-shirts, various stationeries, compliments from Tan Chong. On offer was also special tyre offers from Yokohama!!!!<br><br>Now we are much wiser and can converse with others on the different emission requirements in Japan and here and how this affects our environment, the car performance and even our fuel consumption!!! How about that! Do you know the difference between a parallel import and another from TC? I don't mean the cosmetics only but the engine configuration etc. etc?<br><br>All in all a fruitful and enjoyable day thanks to the hard-working K Rider and his team of organisers and also Tan Chong.<br><br>Good work, man<br><br>Toadie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wil_74,Do you mind telling us how you broke your drive shaft?<br><br>I am curious.<br><br>Toadie<br><br>Also the CVT mentioned refers to the 'Continuously Variable Transmission'. This means there sre no gears in the drive system. Instead there is a belt which links two pulleys together which will then regulate the speed. This system has slow pickup, slightly better fuel consumption and can be shown by a lack of 'creep' ie when you stop at a traffic light,you don't have to step on your brakes to prevent the car from 'creeping' forward. This is not the case for our Marches as we use a conventional AT gear box. According to Dave Koh this uses a different type of transmission fluid.<br>Our CVTC  (is it CVCTC?)engine refers to the valve timing system. I can't remember what CVTC stands for but the V is for valve, not variable. This is similar to Toyota's VVTI (Variable Valve Timing Ignition) sysytem, and also the Honda VTEC. It means that for different speeds when you need different power, the valve regulates the air-fuel mixture into the piston chamber. This is a good development  for engine efficiency and that is why our Marches can get 13+ kpl despite having 98 hp. But don't take my word as gospel truth, Check it with Mr Dave Koh in our next Q + A session.</div>

Some bloody history lessonsÂ…!<br><br>As for AT's (your everyday automatic transmission), they're relatively primitive, lose too much power (which is, "fluid coupling" via a torque converter?!), and reliability doesn't seem any much better or worse than CVT's anyway.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi NYC Micra,<br><br>Thanks for your posting. I was just talking to Tedz and both of us have the same problem, ie rough gear change from 1st to 2nd, as if the engine is racing and then the surge This is more pronounced than from 2nd to 3rd and to 4th.<br><br>Hi Faded Mango,<br><br>Thanks for the tip on Munching Monkies. Food was good and portions were small but it was alright as it suited us well. Unfortunately most of the items were finished when we went there. Anyway now I know how to get there, I will go earlier and also know what to order. Price is half of what you would spend in Spageddies. Dessert looks very tempting but we did not try it as we had some cake at home, but will most certainly try it on next trip. Good tip, my kids enjoyed it.<br><br>Toadie</div>
