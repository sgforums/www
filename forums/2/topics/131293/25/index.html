            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>I was at a petrol station and the attendant asked me why I bought this "kak poh chia" (froggie car). I wanted to tell him that if the car was kissed in the right place  it would turn into a beautiful girl. Of course you would have to know where the lips start and where the "a..." begins otherwise it wouldn't work. Tan Chong did not reveal this in their hurried handover and I did not know where I was supposed to start and that was why I was still driving it. But of course I didn't bother as my 'hokkien' wasn't too powderful. But I admit my green car does look like a frog, hence my nick. If I stuck black spots around it , I think it would look like toad, perhaps even a poisonous one.<br><br>For those interested in Perth I think NTUC has 3 houses in Joondalup in Perth which are for rent. A 3 br house set just next to the Joondalup golfcourse. In fact you can 'climb' over the fence and start your game from hole#... (I can't remember which hole) and avoid paying the green fees, if you feel like it. But seriously the houses are rented very cheaply at stretches of 3 or 4 days, (weekends and weekdays).Everything is provided, TV kitchen, utensils etc. Rent a car and you can begin to experience what its like to stay in A'lia.<br><br>Good night<br><br>Toadie</div>
