            <div class='col-md body'>To All who are interested in my last trip to Damar Laut,<br><br>Drive was uneventful. Started at 8am from my hse and met with a small jam in Tuas. Ideally you shd stat at 6am. Breakfast at 2nd Link is Not recommended.<br>Drove up to Ipoh and bypassed KL (recommended). Stopped at Kellie's castle for a short break (recommended). Stayed in Ipoh for dinner and local b/fast (recommemded). Here I would recommend staying in Taiping taking a jeep ride up Bkt Larut (Maxwell Hill)- 19 hairpin turns!!. In Ipoh stayed in Emperor Hotel for abt Rm200+++ for a family rm suite. recommended)<br><br>Stayed in Swiss Gdn apartment-RM250+++ for a 2 br/n vs RM250+++ for a dbl/n. (recommended). Don't swim in the apt pool tho' because the locals swim in the pool  without swimsuits!!. Don't get the wrong idea!! B/fast was provided for all stays so is only 'OK'. Lunch at hotel  (not recommended).  Dinner at Sitiawan, Manjung for 2 nts (abt 30 mins away). Very cheap and quite good, definitely rec'd. Swim in hotel pool (recommended), massage also good but forget abt the water sports, esp'ly the banana boat ride, boring, boring.<br><br>On way back you can stay in KL (shopping), Seremban or Port Dickson or Malacca. I chose PD. Agn apt  'ok-good' (3***) and cheap at RM200+++ for a 2br/n. But same problem with locals and pool. Some even 'swim' with their 'tudungs'!!!!<br><br>Trip was cheap as I only spent RM1000 for 4 nts accomdn and RM250 for petrol + others (for 3 adults and 3 kids).<br><br>My point as always is a trip up north in your own car by DIY is always 'value for money'. But if you wnat 'door to door' service then you have to pay more.<br><br>Also don't speed, stay to 110+10%. If you must speed then do so on inner lane but don't overtake on the inner lane. Otherwise budget another Rm150+++ for every incident.<br><br>Anyone for Kuantan/Kuala Trengganu????<br><br></div>

UV is definitely &gt;99%..<br><br>take a look at below link for the promotion, for those who interested!<br>http://buddyclub.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=4500<br><br>Mirage VKool also not bad actually, but i looking more to IR heat reduction and 3M films win hands down, as i drive my car during the day in the scorching sun to shadeless areas very often and I also very hiao. must protect my face from UV rays..<br><br>If Blade28 &amp; the rest using mirage got no complaints, then, i think should be fine.. especially if they tend to park in cooler spots..<br><br>Looking forward to a cooler me next week and a 3M protected Marchie!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>
