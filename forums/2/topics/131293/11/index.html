            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Saj.....<br><br>there a difference btw polish n wax...polishes are usually abrasives that takes away the oxide on ur paint to reveal a fresh layer of paint. You then apply a wax which forms a film over the newly revealed paint to protect it and give it a good shine. Therefore, they are different......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> i think <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>for tinting u better ask the boys.....<br><br>this was frm another writer....<br>Perfect, Xpress Cool and Llumar look is cheap! The light front and dark rear (gangsta) tint can be gotten relatively cheap with many packages to choose from, even with the same brand of film.<br><br>Quality is expensive!  The higher the IR reduction capability, the more expensive it is.<br><br>Tried out Ray-Shield's 95% tint (Quote of $838 for my ride). Damn good in reducing the solar heat. Difference between the lesser films is significant, even the 80%, which is just a step down. Surprisingly, the VLT is very high, about 85% front and 64% back.<br><br>Next is Llumar, supposedly big in USA. Pretty good and their premium film package is on par with Ray-Shield's top package, after discount.<br><br>Last, Express Cool. Front IR reduction is oni about 70% and back is 90%. However this package givea a very dark rear, which I'm not that keen.<br><br>Will check out Rike-Cool next week. Personally, I feel these brands' premium package (Ray-Barrier and Llumar) is on par with V-Kool.<br><br>they guys will know more...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Saj, I have used Ray-Barrier and found it to be a waste. I have also tried V-Kool and found it to be very good. But this was the top-end range which technically would not pass the visibility test by Vicom. Recently I was persuaded to try 3M (not the top grade as that would also not pass the test, but the 2nd grade). Therefore I think 3M and V-kool are about par for the same grades but V-Kool is about S$50 more. I have not tried Rike-Kool, Llumar etc tho'. FYI I paid S$630 or 650 for 3M and V-Kool is about $680 or $700. Both have 10 year warranties. While I certainly recommend solar films in our climate you must not forget that aircon for the March is small and cannot compare with that of other bigger cars. If you are interested I suggest you get a group and negotiate a group discount. But I would recommend a good workable solar film. In fact I dare to say that once you drive with it, all your other cars will have it.<br><br>I am going with my family this Sun or Mon to Swiss Garden, Damar Laut and will be back next week. The rate is M$230+++ with breakfast for 2 per room night. Kamen Rider, if you are reading this, can you recommend a few places to visit, eg Kellie's castle, (where is it?), Teluk Intan- is there a leaning pagoda there? Sitiawan- you need to bring anything to your in-laws (or out-laws), Bkt Tinggi, where is it? Any good food there to recommend? Look forward to your comments.<br><br>Toadie</div>

Normally, if you change rims is to up a little performance + looks and stability. We can go for 15 inch,16 inch,17 inch max for our march.........! depends what you want to go for..! (performance and stability) ..... (Looks and stability). By the way our offset for rims is a little tough to get the good fit...! it depends on what design you want for your rims; deepdish, 5 spook and etc.............!<br><br>For Novice just change a set of rims that will look good and gives you a little more holding..!<br><br>There are lots of other steps after which........... take it easy and dun stress on it. Hahaha..! is good to change rims get a low profile tires with more traction...! our stock suspension which is too soft which creates body roll.. is a little tough to tackle a high speed/ sharp cornering.
