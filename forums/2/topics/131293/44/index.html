And how long is the term? If it takes 5 years for 92Ron to 'affect' the car then i am not too bothered. Will it still affect the car if i switch between 'octanes'?<br><br>With the petrol prices going up, i've been switching between the 'octanes' and doing some experiment with regards to mileage. Seems that nowadays 98 does not give me the best mileage anymore (getting about 14.5km/l) and 92 seems able to match it in terms of mileage. But realised (maybe psychological) 98 really gives more 'power' and smoother pickup. Done some calculation, i will save about $4 per tank and about $25 a month. Not much by certain pples standard but still a form of cost cutting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
