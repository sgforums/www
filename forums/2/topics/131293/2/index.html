Main consideration is whether your husband will change jobs anytime in the future. Your usage of the car is really ideal for an OPC now, but we're not talking about months here, it's years. Just to take note, after you buy a car, no matter what car or how cheap, as long as your downpayment is not heavy, it will be difficult to sell the car off, at least in the first 2 years. Work out your budget, see how much you can put into the car every month.<br><br>OPC car is a good alternative if u can live with the restriction. Firstly ,there's 17K saving upfront (further saving on loan interest). 2ndly, saving of $800 pa on road tax. This works out to a net saving of $2,500 a year or $48 a week ($48 divided by $20 = 2.4 coupons a week).<br><br>Don't forget there are 11 public holidays in a year....If u can restrict yourself to 2 coupons a week, u will be better off owning a OPC vs a normal car.<br><br>The next question is on monthly cash flow. A typical example for a brand new OPC: HDB parking $90, petrol $250, road tax $4.15, Insurance $125, instalment $498 (7 yr loan for $36000), maintenance $50 =total $1,020 per month .<br><br>coe car:<br>road tax increases by 10% up to 50% for each year onwards after renewing coe<br>likely to have more maintenance and repair problem<br>old car, not so shiok<br>no usage hours restrictions<br><br>If you are able to get used to the restricted usage hours for years to come, then opc will save you a bundle. The potential saving is $2500 per year($1700 + $800). A new car also will probably not give you so much headache.<br>To consider a coe car, you need to look at what's the depreciation. Since a coe car has no parf, just take the selling price divide by the number of years left. It will probably be more than that of a new opc car.<br><br>If you never display the coupon, 1st offence fine of not exceeding $5000 and subsequent conviction fine of not exceding $10000.<br><br>If tampering of coupon, fine of not exceeding $20000 or imprisonment of not exceeding 12 months or both.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br></div>

I am just wondering whether there will be any potential/common problems with march in the long run.<br><br>Currently I have owned my march for only abt 2 months. The only thing I felt is that the changing of gear is not smooth (esp 1st to 2nd). However, if the car has warmed up sufficiently (ie travelled a few km) then the prob disappears and it is a very smooth ride. Other than this minor prob, I am very satisfied and happy with my marchie.<br><br>Maybe those who have own march for a longer period would like to share.<br><br>I am also wondering who has the 'oldest' march K12 in this forum. hee... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
