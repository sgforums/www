            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I actually wrote this out last night but lost it while typing it because I took too long.  This is not the first time.<br><br>Anyway as the great leader has commanded me to write a precis of the Royal Purple talk I guess I don't have much of a choice.<br><br>Lubricating oil aka lube oil aka crankshaft or crankcase oil aka 'orh eu' (black oil) is used primarily to prevent friction between the moving parts of the engine. The lube oil being slippery causes the pistons to move smoothly. Without it the pistons will seize.<br><br>It also carries away heat generated in the engine and it also washes away carbon deposits and other acids brought about by inefficient firing. The acids arise from the additives that are inherent in the petrol. If the acid is not removed it will corrode the piston or piston rings and you have to change them, a costly process. Similarly for the carbon deposits. Old engines, old spark plugs will cause inefficient firing of the petrol mixture, thereby wasting fuel, adding unburnt carbon in your piston chambers<br><br>Lube oil also provides a 'shield' or coating on the pistons and the piston chambers to protect them. This is very much like coating your wooden flooring with a plastic or lacquer base to prevent them from scratching.<br><br>The lube oil is contained in a sump or a container at the bottom of the engine. This automatically lubricates the crankshafts. Lube oil is also pumped and squirted onto the pistons and the chamber during the time the engine is working, much like when soap and water is squirted onto your car when it goes through a car wash. However the viscosity of the lube oil changes when the temparature changes. It becomes less thick, or more watery when the temparature rises and vice versa. So at room temperature when you start the car, and the lube is pumped to the pistons, it is running fine. Later when the engine heats up, the viscosity will change, ie it becomes less thick, in fact thinner and when it is pumped up it might slip pass the piston rings and be combusted in the oiston chambers. This will cause a loss of power and also greater carbon deposits because you are not burning petrol but also mineral oil. Some of the oil will also get onto the spark plugs and cause the chamber to malfunction, leading to loss of power. (Imagine running on 2 or 3 pistons for a 4 piston engine) The manufacturers have therefore tried to provide an engine oil that will not change their viscosity too much between temp changes, ie between the time you cold start your engine and when you are driving your engine for a long time, say for 4 or 5 hours without stopping. Getting an ideal oil therefore requires that you choose the SAE rating whenyou buy the oil. This rating should suit your driving profile. Not so much your driving style. Eg you do not need SAE ratings to account for extreme changes in air temperature, like in winter and summer, or in rapid buildup of temperature as in formula racing.<br><br>Too heavy a rating will work when your engine is warmed up but will be sluggish when it is being warmed up. Too light a rating will mean that your engine warms up more quickly, but gets thinner with long sustained hard driving. So choose your oil wisely. If you are an average driver, stick within the average range. If you drive like Schumacher, buy the higher range and if you think you are in the north or south pole, buy those that work in minus 10C ratings. Also don't overfill your lube oil, just don't forget to check if you have 80% left in your sump at all times<br><br>The ability of the oil to 'coat' a protective layer over your pistons and the chambers are also important, for obvious reasons.<br><br>Also the ability of the oil to clean the engine by carrying away heat, acids and carbon deposits are also important. Always check you lube oil after 5000 km to ensure they are not dirty. This means that they have a high content of carbon which must be removed, ie to change te lube oil. Otherwise the carbon deposits will cause inefficient firing leading to loss of power and higher fuel consumption, leading to more spending on petrol leading to poorer members leading to a poorer March club. We were shown the difference between new or fresh lube and one which was used for 7000 km. It would be difficult to describe the difference. Easier to see with your own eyes<br><br>I am told that Royal Purple is one of the best in the world (but of course I don't know that for a fact) but surprisingly it is cheaper than Shell or Esso. A good approach would be to try it out for some changes, say 2 to 4 oil changes and to decide by then.<br><br>The good news is that all March club members will have a special price for RP lube oil on proof of membership. Only available to our members!!!!!<br><br>Also be careful of recycled oils. Apparently there are many in the market and it is difficult to spot them (eg made in I'sia) Recycled oils are not made with the same stringent standards as newly manufactured ones (so we were told)<br><br>Hope you enjoyed reading this. Better still just come for the talk the next time and also get your own door gift.<br><br>Toadie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1. What are the main lubrication problems in passenger car engines?</strong>.<br><br>MostLubrication problems for passenger car engines fall primarily into the following areas: [/color]<br><br>Â•Low-temperature or light-duty operation. This is when a car makes a lot of short trips that never allow the engine to reach its optimum operating temperature. Partially burned fuel byproducts can result in sludge deposits and excessive rust.<br>Â•High-temperature oxidation. Engine operating temperatures today are extremely high while the amount of oil in the sump is small, as little as four quarts. This severe heat stress on the oil can accelerate oil oxidation, resulting in oil thickening, loss of lubricating properties, varnish and piston deposits.<br>Â•Passenger car engines deliver high horsepower in relation to the size and weight of engine components. This places great stress on engine parts such as the valvetrain, which strains to provide the high cam lift and spring loads required for efficiency and high engine speeds.<br>Â•The use of air-pollution control devices such as positive crankcase ventilation and exhaust gas recirculation can increase the heat stress on an oil and increase the amount of contaminants in the oil.<br><strong><br>2. How can I be sure I'm getting high-quality oil?</strong><br><br>Ok, Throughout the world there are many differences in the oils. In general, name brand oil meets or exceeds automobile manufacturer specifications, industry standards and governmental regulations. Users should use the type of oil recommended in their vehicle handbook/owners manual or an oil that claims to be approved by the manufacturer of their vehicle. After this, owners may look to an industry standard, such as from JASO, ACEA or API, for guidance. The licenses ILSAC Certification Mark or "starburst symbol" to be placed on the front of oil bottles, certifying that those oils are the appropriate oil for gasoline-powered passenger cars, light trucks, minivans and SUVs.<br><br></div>

The main factor affecting the life of the oil is the storage condition for the products. Exposure to extreme temperature changes, and moisture will reduce the shelf life of the lubricants. ie. don't leave in the sun with the lid off. Best to keep them sealed and unopened.<br><br>Technically, engine oils have shelf lives of four to five years. However, as years pass, unused engine oils can become obsolete and fail to meet the technical requirements of current engines. The specs get updated regularly based on new scientific testing procedures and engine requirements. But this is only really a concern if you've bought a brand new car but have engine oil you bought for the previous car. An oil that is a number of years old might not be formulated to meet the requirements set for your newer engine.<br><br>If your unopened containers of engine oil are more than three years old, read the labels to make sure they meet the latest industry standards. If they do meet the current standards, you might want to take the extra precaution of obtaining oil analysis before using them. An oil analysis will check for key properties of the oil and ensure that it still meets the original manufacturing specs. Of course the cost of getting an analysis done on old oil is probably going to outweigh going and buying fresh stuff. So it's a double-edged sword.<br>As a general rule, the simpler the oil formulation, the longer the shelf life. The following is a guideline under protected conditions:<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Viscosity and Viscosity<br><br>The proper viscosity is the single most important criteria of a lubricating oil. The basic performance of machinery is based on the viscosity of the lubricant. Viscosity is, if you like, the resistance to the flowability of the oil. The thicker an oil, the higher its viscosity. The chart on the right shows a rough guide to ambient temperatures vs oil viscosity performance in both multigrade (top half) and single grade (lower half) oils.<br><br>Multigrade oils work by having a polymer added to a light base oil which prevents the oil from thinning too much as it warms up. At low temperatures, the polymers are coiled up and allow the oil to flow as it's low number (W number) indicates. As the oil heats up, the polymers unwind into long chains which prevent the oil from thinning as much as it normally would. The result is that at 100Â°C, the oil has thinned only as much as it's higher rating. Think of it like this: a 10W30 oil is a 10-weight oil that will not thin more than a 30-weight oil when it gets hot.<br><br>The viscosity index of a lubricant is an empirical formula that allows the change in viscosity in the presence of heat to be calculated. This tells the user how much the oil will thin when it is subjected to heat. The higher the viscosity index, the less an oil will thin at a specified temperature. Multi-viscosity motor oils will have a viscosity index well over 100, while single viscosity motor oils and most industrial oils will have a VI of about 100 or less.<br>Viscosity and oil weight numbers is quite a nauseatingly detailed topic. So if you're curious about why a 15W50 oil is so-called, then put on the geek shield and pop over to the Viscosity page:<br><br>http://www.chris-longhurst.com/carbibles/viscosity.html<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Air Fliter / Open Pod or drop in boils down to what individual wants!.<br>More performance or normal driving...!<br><br>Engines pump about 10,000 litres of air for every litre of fuel consumed, and along with all that air, they suck in plenty of dirt and grit. A good air filter will stop everything bigger than a micron in diameter - everything smaller mostly just floats around harmlessly in the 0.001inch minimum thickness oil films that separate all the moving parts. Despite all of this, there will always be submicron particles that get in and there will be places in the engines oilways where they will gather. Every time you empty the oil from your sump, you're also draining this fine grit with it.</div>
