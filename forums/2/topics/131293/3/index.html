            <div class='col-md body'>Hi lennie long time no see and no hear, guess it must have been 9 months. Good of you tp be giving valuable advice here recently and has been reading our posts all these while. Why don't you come and meet us again, we are also a bunch of fun and hilarious bunch. The pple here sure knows the existence of the other website and also the information you can get there, the deals that is going on, the events etc etc. I will not say that the pple are threatened or shy to join but to each their own just like not all pple will join the Book Worm Club but Book Worm Club will always welcome pple. It would definitely help if we have someone like you that can answer the queries of the forumers here and with your experience in the K12 and your contacts of workshops or pple, the pple here will benefit from your contribution. This will definitely give the forumers here a helping hand in having different views and ideas and also point out the "misconceptions" of the K12.<br><br>And also some of the pple wanted to drive north and you would be the best person to give us some tips since you do it often enough. Really hope to see you in one of our meetups and share your experiences with us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, ok fair enuff about the bookworm club, i will try to help as i know the k12 to my own personal experience but ideally if you have any question(s) then i would rather a sms or a call and maybe a meet-up to see how i can help.if i can't answer the question(s) to the/your problem(s) then i will ask another or friends of mine to help?<br>once again i am not a car guru neither i am some japanese and french engineer that design the k12 ya hehehehhe but i figure honesty is the best policy and as all of you already know that i am into mods and  as not being rude to all you guys/gals is that 'i don't think i will join all you guys for bbq and such for now' i hope you know where i am coming from ya but a meet-up for mods that i will be very much into it, its pretty late know so excuse my "England for not bein so powderful" to understand/comprehend.<br>Driving up north? when? KL? that one(KL) i surely/CONFIRM go if my job schedule permits cos may-july i busy with heaps of project, NS highway is a very good way to test the speed and power of the car. stock k12 can go 160km without any problems but cannot have any obstruction ahead lah such as vehicles, ducks, snakes and crocodiles cos need distance to archieve that kind of speed as i remembered back then and keep 50 ringgit in side pocket to bribe you know who lah if kena road block.<br>let me know if you guys goin up north cos also i think my car also need to clear carbon again cos can feel she(k12) chocking again hehehhehehehhe...<br><br>L<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by KingMariot:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi lennie long time no see and no hear, guess it must have been 9 months. Good of you tp be giving valuable advice here recently and has been reading our posts all these while. Why don't you come and meet us again, we are also a bunch of fun and hilarious bunch. The pple here sure knows the existence of the other website and also the information you can get there, the deals that is going on, the events etc etc. I will not say that the pple are threatened or shy to join but to each their own just like not all pple will join the Book Worm Club but Book Worm Club will always welcome pple. It would definitely help if we have someone like you that can answer the queries of the forumers here and with your experience in the K12 and your contacts of workshops or pple, the pple here will benefit from your contribution. This will definitely give the forumers here a helping hand in having different views and ideas and also point out the "misconceptions" of the K12.<br><br>And also some of the pple wanted to drive north and you would be the best person to give us some tips since you do it often enough. Really hope to see you in one of our meetups and share your experiences with us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote></div>
