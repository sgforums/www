            <div class='col-md body'>I realised this car is rather clever and cute and I think FC is really not bad. Then again, true enough family members said it is overpriced and so on. That is not something I care. I am just afraid Nissan would bring in the convertible one or a better model after I buy, cos now is near year of end already.<br><br>On the other hand, I understand march targets a very niche market, so I am also thinking Nissan has no plans for March but just leave it as how it is now.<br><br>Someone mentioned about the black interior at nissan's Japan site, it is really so nice. I love black interior too.<br><br>I am still doing my research. But the car price is very reasonable now i feel.<br><br>thanks for the warm welcome KamenRider.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by KamenRider:</div><div class="quote_body">welcome welcome ShiokMC and LightningRune (wow so long never say such welcoming message already)!!<br><br>glad to see you come join us, we hope you will enjoy the company of the Marchies here, we sure will enjoy yours.<br><br>This time how about we make things a bit different. we have in the past been impressing potential buyers how good a March is. how about this time you both tell us WHY you are/have choosing/chosen a Nissan March, after all there are newer and better(?) alternatives?<br><br>would be exciting to hear you out.</div></blockquote></div>
