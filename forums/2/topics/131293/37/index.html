Why dun you join us on our monthly meet ups and you can show us how performance and basic tuning is abt. You MIA for since last Nov. I m sure a lot our fellow mates once to know. May be a Q&amp;A session and pop the bonnet thingy and conduct some talks. They have to put the face to your name, No doubts abt it that your ride is the fastest k12 around. May be join us on Sunday during the AutoT. Show at Marina South, as March12 club we can convoy to M.S.. meet at kallang 1st.<br><br>Novice or advance, I am not even close to Novice in terms of performance knowledge. BASIC tuning may beÂ…! It all depends on what skool you belong to..! performance, dress up and iceÂ…! I am a dresser and ICEÂ…  i dress up cars which gives me the tripping feel more than Â“speedÂ”Â…Having basic enhancement to gain back the lose of power for added on weight on Â“ICEÂ” and etc !<br><br>For 1.4 Auto, open pod dun really works well at the point where you lose a little at the low end..! The open Pod theory ! Â“do not installÂ” to each itÂ’s ownÂ… good or no good is individual and depends on individual demands asking for what returns, performance is abt adding some and lose some or add on all and gain moreÂ…! I do not re-invent any technical theoriesÂ… I go for K&amp;N drop ins, all old skool and simple.  The only invention I did was to give my ride a euro/blink lookÂ….My car was never design for performance, I am far from your league and different skool..! after all tripping on performance days are overÂ…!  just low and slow.<br><br>Regards to my melb stay was greatÂ… ! my SKYLINE GT-ST 2.5L...computer tune, was running on abt 285ph(max out/budget), pulsar GTR full rally specs with rally enforcement bims comes stock roar car.. after 6months get rid of it problem child Â…! SKYLINE is a better ride. Since I started on 4wheels/2wheelers that was more than a decade ago, I never buy new carsÂ… is always 2nd hand cars to thrash! Too bad my trashing days ended when I have to return my class3 back to the TP for almost 3years. The K12 was my 1st new car purchase, worst of all. There were constraints, I took the last KH3 for 04 production comfort model, I wasnÂ’t into warranty and bullshit but I need my assurance and warranty; incase of any manufacturing default. No choice, have to stick to the 3 servicing to keep my warranty.  Basic Car maintenance, surprise that i might need a refresher course on thatÂ…!<br><br>Blood = engine oil, Brains = ECU, Heartbeat = piston and cams..<br><br>i guess being a loyal customer of Imperial Concept, most of your stuff must be purchase via them through magazines. Must be spending a bomb a lot  !!!! I am sure you can purchase things cheaper with discounts, why dun you try asked from Simon the rest of the partners to give march club some discounts for purchase. May be even conducting a Tech Talk for the bookworm club. I sure every one here will be very keen, and I believe a lot of them would like to tour IC.<br><br>See you ! cheers !<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>A friend of mine has a car with a keyless entry, (not a March). He told me this interesting possibility.<br><br>Assume husband and wife or gf travel in the car. On arrival, husband leaves with his i-key in his pocket. Wife or gf continues, either to park or to go shopping. Wife/gf has another i-key in her handbag.<br><br>According to my friend this will result in the car 'reading' from 2 i-keys and will cause a malfunction requiring the keys to be re-programmed.  Do you know this to be the case? Has it happened to any of our members here? Is my friend correct? Can anyone throw light here, or ask the SE about this case or even Mr David Yeo (?) Owners of the 14E will be interested since it may affect them?<br><br>Cheers and a Safe and Enjoyable Trip to Vandagal tomorrow.<br><br>Toadie</div>
