But when it comes to the number of new vehicles, AIG is tops. The American insurer estimates that it will provide cover for at least 50 per cent of the expected 110,000 or so passenger cars and commercial vehicles registered in 2004.<br><br>To date, the number of policies AIG has written in 2004 has increased 17.5 per cent over the same period in 2003. Last year, AIG insured about 50,000 new vehicles out of about 96,000 vehicles. Coming a distant second is local insurer Income, which has about 14 per cent of the new vehicle market. As expected, French insurer AXA is third, with about 11 per cent.<br><br>But in terms of premiums, the three insurers' market share is markedly different. Based on third quarter figures from the General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA), Income is the market leader with about 38 per cent, AIG with 18 per cent and AXA, 10 per cent. Together, they have two-thirds of a market worth about $700 million last year.<br><br>The reason for the difference, AXA explained, is that the new car market is traditionally tied up with certain insurers. 'Most popular makes such as Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai and Honda work exclusively with one insurance company and AXA is one of them,' said AXA executive vice-president Patrick Font, adding that two of the dealerships AXA is connected to are Honda and BMW.<br><br>In AIG's case, it has ties with - among others - Toyota and Nissan, which are the No 1 and No 3 makes in Singapore respectively. 'Our insurance products are available in seven out of the top 10 dealerships in Singapore,' said Rudi Spaan, president of American Home Assurance Singapore (AHA), a member company of the AIG group. He said that the main selling points of AIG policies are the New-for-Old coverage - a benefit which replaces an insured car with a new one in the event of a total loss in year one - and repairs for up to 10 years with the original dealership, if renewed under the dealership programme.<br><br>'Many other products in the market limit the repair choice of the customer and often exclude the original dealership,' said Mr Spaan. 'This in turn could jeopardise manufacturers' warranty and hence we promote car owners to repair their vehicle with their authorised dealership.'<br><br>Unlike AIG and AXA, Income's policyholders have to visit an Independent Damage Assessment Centre or Idac in the event of an accident. Repair work is assigned to workshops which offer the best price but Income will allow engine-related repairs at the authorised agent's workshop.<br><br>'Most of the buyers of new cars are insured for the first year with the insurance company that is tied with the car dealer,' said Income CEO Tan Kin Lian.<br><br>'A large percentage of these owners come to NTUC Income during the second year, as our premium rates tend to be more competitive.'<br><br>Income said that its car premiums are about 10 per cent less than the other top five motor insurers - AIG, AXA, Asia Insurance and India International Insurance.<br><br>The distributor of a popular Japanese make said insurers which are not part of Idac - like AIG and AXA - are more attractive because they allow car owners to visit workshops run by the dealerships themselves. 'By ensuring that our customers return to us for repairs, we can control the after-sales market,' he said.<br><br>AIG's Mr Spaan said that not subscribing to Idac means his company provides 'a true one-stop shop experience'.<br><br></div>
