(meanwhile sounding and displaying the red "key" alarm)<br><br>if the spare ikey who has the same ID as Mr. ABC comes in or within range, the car will know and operation will continue as normal again.<br><br>there are different types of RFID systems, some are active and some passive. many applications. quite cool stuff. dunno what else have been invented lately.<br><br>yeah angpow, come join our coming events, many interesting ones coming out!!<br>[/code]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those whom wish to drive to Cherating..... (lady drivers)Â…..<br><br>It's early morning on 6th aug ..abt 6amÂ…. My alarm clock start ringing , went to make breakfast for the 2 sleeping beauties and went to check on the car and drove to the foot of the hdb flat . Done with the usual business and with both of them up, we left home abt 6.40amÂ…Â…the night before I had gone to Shell station at Sembanwang area to ensure that the tank is 3/4 full so I don't have any brush our "protective" law (if they really checked).<br><br>By 7am , I reach the causeway(Woodland). "****"...It's already jam. Pass the Singapore side in about 30 mins but was stuck in the Malaysia side for about 20mins. Finally, I was in JB and we could see the build-up of traffic due to occasional being held up at traffic lights. Our first destination is Mersing but frm JB, we pass-by Kota tinggi and I had to be sure that I was on Truck Road Number 3. Had to topped up petrol and there were very few rest-stopsÂ…. The road is winding in between the little hills and it's a fun time driving around the mild corners at approx 100km/hrs. For this section between JB and Mersing, we see hills and plantations all around. Progress was slow due to occasional slow down by too many big Malaysia lorry drivers. My poor Marchie got a hard time trying to overtake themÂ…Â…they do not really want to give way to Singapore drivers, heck, I was really a saint not to blast my car horn on them, they really block ur view and with all the dirt flying frm their tires, I was worried if I had stones hitting my screen.<br><br>Finally at approx 10 plus am, we reach Mersing's first roundabout , there r 2 roundabouts and the sign is pretty far off and I missed the turn!!! Lucky I was headed to the 2nd roundabt where I pulled over and my hubby ask a biker where was the turn. As I went backed to the 1st roundabt , my hubby said that the sign did not say Pahang or anything closed to that !!!  Don't ask me why we took nearly 2hrs to complete the approx 150km distance between JB and Mersing. Top up petrol at the Shell station before the roundabout and stop over for lunch at the cafÃ© that had proper loo and food. We still have a long journey, about 250km more. We will pass by Kuantan before heading to Cherating. The long drive start again. For the journey between Mersing and Kuantan, we see the beach occasionally but I think the place was wonderful if they did not have to cut down so many trees and some land was really burnt crisp, a really waste. There isn't so much lorry around and our journey become less taxing for my dear Marchie. Only thank god for ABS and good tires, there r some places where the goats and cows will really run across the road, I really blast my horn, but still had to jammed the breaksÂ…Â…Â….. We pass-by alot of beach and small villages like Rompin (quite beach area but still lacking development) While crossing Rompin, please drive with care, due to wind draft from the coastal road. (Especially near those prawn farming area as road are not that straight alot of bends and small bridges - try not to overtake others, unless.....!!!!Other small towns like Mercung , Nenasi before finale Kuantan town is in sight. But we didn't stop and continue our way up as we are running out of time. Slowly we figure our way pass Kuantan and back to Road 3 again, the signs do not say much and was looking for Cukai  Â…Â…Â…Â…<br><br>After passing Kuantan(Very steep uphill and down slope but without much bends). It's another 50km more before we reach our final destination which is Impiana Resort Cherating. Guess I had made a bad turn and was headed to Chempedak beach where there was a dead endÂ…..really wasted time and and had to ask where the turning was to Beserah town where they used water buffaloÂ’s to haul in the fishing netsÂ…. On the way we pass by a lot of place including Club Med Cherating &amp; Cherating Village. Finally we reach our destination Impiana Resort at slightly before 3.35pm . The Impiana is not bad. The suites have 4 post beds. I think it is a good choice if you want to stay for a few days. KLers go there for the weekend usually. The hotel was having a aug promo for rooms with breakfast was $118 rigÂ…Â….The village chalets will be abt $105 per night tooÂ…Â…Check in to our rooms and we were out again for  very late lunch again as I had 2 complain kings in the car who said I did nothing more than drive !!! Really needs guts to drive and guess u have to be super careful in over-taking the very slow drivers and the Lorries.<br><br>Time now is 1600hrs. It's now time for a break after nearly 10hrs of driving (0700hrs - 1600hrs). Took a nap while my son &amp; hubby went to seaside to playÂ…Â… woke up after 1 hr nap, walked down to the beach, a lovely view but the waves are a bit rough and it was pretty warm, but my son &amp; hubby both loved it and did not want dinnerÂ…Â….Our room is only about 100m away from the beach and it's seaview. Took a drive to cherating town but I could not find it, headed back n  After which we go for our dinner at the resort. Food is lousy, I will give it 5/10Â…Â…my hubby food had part of a muslin cloth inside the soup and the I went to complain to the manager who voided half of the bill. After the lousy dinner, we went back to our room and have a bottle of red wine till it's time to sleep. That ends our very first day in Cherating.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Day two, 7th aug begins at 0900hrs. We have breakfast too at the resort, it's like a rating of 7/10. As this trip is suppose to be for rest and relax,  we drove out to explore the place. First we went to Chukai Town, we drove around and discover that there isn't more thing thus we drove on into the road that leads to Club Med hoping to be able to see how Club Med is like. Maybe it can be our next place of stay. But too bad only guest are allow to enter , very strict, we saw guards patrolling the beach too and we discover that along the road there is a CHERATING TURTLE SANCTUARY that's very interesting and also very sad .<br><br>Types of turtle coming ashore on Cherating beaches.<br>GREEN TURTLE (CHELONIA MYDAS) :<br>It can grow up to one meter and weigh about 135Â–170 kg. Eat vegetables, sea-grass and algae. It lays between 80Â–150 eggs at one time. In Pahang this species is the most common of all those coming ashore, accounting for about 90% of all the turtles.<br>LEATHERBACK TURTLE( DERMOCHELYS) :<br>It is the biggest species in the world and can grow up to two meters. Most of its life is spent searching for food in cold deep seas. It can lay eggs 4Â–5 times per season with 60Â–10 eggs each time.<br>HAWKSBILL TURTLE (ERETMOCHELYS) :<br>This turtle has a beak that is similar to the beak of an eagle. It can grow up to 70Â–80 cm long. It prefers sea that has coral reefs. It is the most beautiful among all the turtles. It can lay up to 150 eggs.<br><br>The office told me that if the turtle lands n lays the eggs, if villagers r 1st there, they will keep the eggs and cook it or sell it at $3 rig each !!!  I think the officer says thatÂ’s why they only can patrol only 3.5kms of beach front !!! This year they have 4 landings and even in Terengganu, there was no sightings of any turtles !! Really wish the Govt could do moreÂ….on thisÂ…..really sad, my son was upset when office told them in 50 years time, the turtles may not come back, all scaredÂ…Â…Â…hope they turn to Singapore east coast area, safer maybe !!!!<br><br>After this we proceed to Cherating Village, over here there are a lot of budget chalets which some looks pretty nice. I will be staying here for my next Cherating Trip if I do come back. Went to the Cherating Culture Center and we were shown how batik is made. Brandon was starting to burn up/ fever, I panicked as there r no clinics around !!  Left the village and drove back down to Swiss Garden hotel that was nearer and that placed was packed with so many singaporean carsÂ…Â…Â….well they had a gift shop that sells children fever medicationÂ…Â…drove back and slept till 2000hrs, we drove again to Cherating Village to have dinner at the restaurant that had some soupy food<br><br>Day 3 ..8th Aug Monday, I plan to wake up early for breakfast as we have booked an inbound trip to see waterfalls and see cavesÂ…as I do not want to drive and having to be lost most of the time. met the guide after 9.35am, we headed to :<br><br>Â•	Natural Waterfalls - The Sungai Pandan Waterfalls which span 11 hectares, is situated 72 km from Cherating and is easily accessible by road. Consisting of a series of cascading rapids, the falls culminate in a large cooling pool, which is ideal for swimming. A very popular picnic spot.<br><br>* Gua Charah - Approximately 1 1/2 hours drive through a scenic oil palm estate, Charah caves are sited northwest of Panching, enroute to Sungai Lembing. Formed millions of years ago and carved by nature, these caves offer an interesting sojourn. Housed inside one of the caves is a statue of the reclining Buddha.<br><br>At the waterfalls, we saw about 80 cars from Singapore that had the sticker frm 8days magazine and SPCpetrol, which I had put up on sgforums if anyone wanted to goÂ…Â…Â…Â…sometime ago. Well, I guess having the peace and quietness of the waterfalls was mostly gone and a few members of wheelsforfun company had taken the 1st jump into the water, manage to get a card from the road boss , Christopher queck who by that time was in the water with his baby gal. Hehee, hope they may helped to organize a trip for us in the near future!!!<br><br>Got back to the hotel abt 5pm, freshen up and went down to the pool, not many people n the KL big group has left, so more peace . &amp;pm, got ready for another drive out of cherating area , For dinner, we went to Chukai for their famous stuffed crabs. Someone recommended Restoran Tong Juan to us. At this point, hubby and son was getting cranky as they both were hungry, they have a website ---&gt; http://www.stuffedcrab.com/<br>Another day is gone, what the hell, came back to room and open another bottle of red wine to drinkÂ…Â…Â…Â…..zzzzzz<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Day 4 9th Aug, how time flies, woke up abt 9am and still in time for breakfast, after breakfast , went down to check on the carÂ…Â… and we check out at approx 1000hrs to proceed back to Singapore . We took the same Road 3 back to Singapore. Top up the tanks at Cherating and we drove all the way to Mersing passing Kuantan. On the way back between Kuantan and Mersing, Driving was still smooth but mostly I saw were all Singapore cars behind me and all r guy drivers !!!! . Approx 250km from Cherating to Mersing, we finally reach Mersing at around 1430 hrs. Stop beside the same shell petrol station , we have mee goreng, mee hoon goreng and chicken burger for lunch. After which we top up our tank and proceed to take the winding road back to JB from Mersing at approx 1530hrs. It was still drizzling a bit . We reach JB at approx 1730hrs and went to Taman sentosa to do a bit of last min shopping , the jammed has started frm Carrefour and the police closed the 2nd link bride for me to turn off !!! well, I had abt 1-2 hrs to be stucked in jb, so do shopping !!!! I missed the  feel of the urban living for that few days in cherating.<br><br>The trip ends with a petrol top-up and so  We leave JB at 2000hrs and traffic at causeway is a bit slowÂ…Â…..well, guys, wht u think of my very short trip???<br><br>Hope to plan for Perlis , Kedah and Penang in the coming futureÂ…Â…Â…Thanks for reading and hope I did not bore that muchÂ…..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ang Pow,<br><br>It's alright. Kamen confirmed TC only provides 1 i-key to 14E owners. If you lose it or want a spare it will cost you $200+, so keep it carefully.<br><br>That's one advantage of visiting this post and joining the  March Club. You have many friends here.<br><br>Vandagal- good to know that you had an enjoyable trip despite the long journey. Did you enjoy the stuffed crabs? Quite ok huh? If you like nasi lemak or nasi Padang, they have very good ones in Kuantan, which actually is not very far from Cherating. I still remember the nasi lemak stall. Coming down from Cherating towards Kuantan, as you reach the outskirts of Kuantan, there are some shops, (Bata, tyre shops etc) and a stall selling nasi lemak, OUTSIDE the corner coffee-shop, only in the evening and very crowded. Nasi Padang stall is in town and difficult to describe.<br><br>In Rompin there is quite a nice hotel with a sea frontage, pool etc which you might consider to stay if you are leaving Cherating later and want to break the journey before going home. Unfortunately I think the food in Rompin is poor.<br><br>Christopher Quek is the founder and owner of "Wheels-for-fun".<br><br>He started the company because he likes travelling to Malaysia and so he decided to combine the two. He uses his local knowledge to make the trip interesting. If you like travelling in Malaysia, are the out-going, boisterous, party animal type, you can probably join him as a part-time 'employee' for some of his trips up north. Should suit you to a 'T'. I don't think he needs mechanics or drivers but he needs people to help him organise games during dinners, Treasure hunts etc. But I could be wrong but still an interesting trip in future. I think he needs a pool of such helpers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi KKT,<br><br>How come you have 2 i-keys when the rest has only 1? Mind explaining for the benefit of the rest?.<br><br>Also do you have the same problem as I asked? Do you drive with 2 i-keys in your pocket? Are they identically programmed? Has your car stopped for any unknown reason before? Can you experiment with your car for the members benefit? Ie Drive with 1 i-key in your pocket and the other in the back seat, stop and leave the engine running,  pass the i-key to another person and continue driving with the other i-key for another 15 minutes?  Can you answer all the questions above?<br><br>Look forward to your input.<br><br>Vandagal, Perhaps next time when you go to Kuantan, you might want to take the route I suggested, since you are now familiar with Kuantan. Ie take the N/S expressway from JB to Yong Peng (Can have a break there), then on to Segamat (for some durians perhaps) and take the road to Kuantan. The road after you leave the N/S expressway to Yong Peng is not good (same as it was in the days before the N/S expressway, ie about 30+ years ago), but the road after Segamat to Kuantan, even though it is not an expressway (single lane only) has less traffic. On the return journey you can take your same route back from Kuantan-Nenasi-Rompin-Mersing-Kota Tinggi-JB as you may want to break your journey since you will probably be travelling in the afternoon. You can take a day trip from Mersing to one of the islands, eg P Rawa, not too far.<br><br>Somebody just came back from KL and suggested that all KL trips be postponed if possible. Haze is 400+ on the index and even reached 500 in Klang Valley (ie hazardous) Some schools are allowed to close, viz is 200m and even the air-conditioned office buildings have haze in the offices. This is an eye-witness report from a person who is also a medical doctor. For more info, tune in to CNA. Imagine our March air filters and ionisers will be working overtime!!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Toadie</div>
