            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all Marchies,<br><br>I've finally made up my mind to get a Nissan March (Elegance) soon. (thanks Kamenrider for giving the advise a while back). I have yet to decide on the colour of the car coz they are all nice! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I went for a test-drive recently and really love this car (even more than before)!! This is what I was offered by the SE: V-kool, tuff kote and reverse sensor. Are these good enough? As a first-time buyer, I really don't know much about all these ... please advice. Thanks in advance!</div>
