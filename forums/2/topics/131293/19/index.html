I only paid S$199 for it and there are 2 additional lunches provided... However, I must admit that we will feel much safer travelling with the AA group as they have reliable mechanics and road marshals travelling in the group. Seems like you fancy such trips.... I am looking forward to participate in more of such activities especially after the last feel-good experience with the TC's weekend getaway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers,<br>Tweety74</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>funny conclusion by this reviewer, esp the frog part:<br><br><span style="color: orange;">"All about the conclusion<br>So, depending on exactly what you are looking for in a city car, it could be on your shopping list. IÂ’ve already recommended one to a friend wanting a car for his 19 year old daughter. Guys might hesitate a bit, because itÂ’s not a Â‘boysÂ’ car. On the other hand they might want to put over their caring sensitive, unaggressive nature, so it could be a babe puller too. Especially for girls who believe that Â‘inside every frog there's a handsome princeÂ’.<br><br>Nissan younger, style-conscious buyers will be attracted by the new car's looks and, having driven it, they should be hooked. Everywhere we went, people stopped to look - young, old, male, female. The March's appeal appeared to intrigue the image-conscious, style advocators and Joe public alike. Once the car starts being assembled locally or made at an AFTA country I am sure Tan Chong will be able to shift not only the future but thousands of MarchÂ’s in Malaysia. </span>"<br><br>taken from <a href="http://www.shermandez.com/HTML/t7.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</div>
