            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Vandagal<br><br>So sorry to know about your accident. Make sure he pay you back every single cent.<br><br>Share same fate with you yesterday when i am driving my gf Nissan March. I was driving out from Frankel Avenue going into Siglap Road. The stupid blue car( I think it was a Toyota) on the lane to my left suddenly want to cut into my lane without any signal, trying to avoid that idiot, i swerve too much to my right and i went onto the centre white line and my right hand side mirror brush against that of the right handside mirror of the oncoming Nissan Cefiro.<br><br>And what happened to the blue toyota? It just sped off without stopping.<br><br>I really have to thank God that both Nissan cars did not meet with a major accident. My gf Nissan March right hand side mirror got Major damage as the mirror got shattered and the whole plastic broke and the side mirror was hanging there. The Nissan Cefiro got a crack on the plastic cover of side mirror signal indicator light.<br><br>Sent the March to Tan Chong at Ubi and was quoted just slightly above 200 bucks for replacement of the whole side mirror. And as i was the one which brush against the side mirror of the Nissan Cefiro, i have to pay for the damage as well.<br><br>All these due to the sudden ignorance of the damn toyota whose driver dun bother to change lane with signaling and checking blindspot.</div>
