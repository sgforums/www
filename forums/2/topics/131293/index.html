First 2-3 year will depreciate the most for new cars... so you are not wrong in saying there might be a good deal out there, especially for those unique but low re-sale marchie cars.......friends gave up and got tired of wheeling-dealing with the dealers... why? coz...<br><br>- 2nd Hand Dealers are still not very realistic in terms of pricing and hoping to hook someone who doesn't know the market. ...The dealers... grrrr... ... all cars are accident free if you believe them..they think ladies r born stupid !!!! then there is a Transfer fee that is around 1k+... that's money down the drain to LTA and not to off-setting your loan. ( still want to give money to the bank n Govt 4 wht ?)<br><br>Do your maths &amp; homework properly I guess... For the more common Jap cars, I don't think I would want to pay a lot more than paper value coz 2-3 years ago, their pricing I think are on the high side compared to current. If that's the case, then a new one might be better. BUT if your intent is to sell after 2-3 years, then a 2nd hand car is definitely more worth it ... especially for those more unique, low resale cars. BUT... you need to have patience dealing with the 2nd hand dealers and be able to 2nd guess the real condition of their car....<br><br>Dealers have tried the following stupid damm lies:<br>1) Insisted the log card was at the 'head office' and will be shown once you book the car<br>2) Insisted there is no difference between Cat A and Cat E COEs.<br>3) Insisted it won't matter if you use the car for the full ten years. TRUE, but who does not want the choice of selling should the car turn out to be a lemon?<br><br></div>

Typically 6 months salary<br><br>2) No more than 30-40% of NET monthly income servicing debt? (including mortgages, loans, credit card bills)<br><br>3) A retirement plan, and regular contribution of your balance income to that plan?<br><br>If you satisfy all of the above conditions, how do you work out the affordability of purchases?<br><br>Simply find out how much you can afford to pay each month to bring your debt servicing to 40%. That's the MAXIMUM installment you can afford to pay each month.<br><br>The maximum downpayment you can afford determines the price of the car you can buy. Obviously you can load up to 100% financing if you wish, but calculate the interest impact first and make sure you understand the trade-off in cost and the amount you lose on resale. I personally would not load more than 70% financing, but others think otherwise. Whatever you wish to pay down, remember you need to rebuild your cash reserves to survive retirement.<br><br>Bottom line is, if you're contributing 40-50% of your net monthly income to savings via retirement plans, insurance, FDs etc, buy anything you want with the balance.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> its not a matter of how much we make every month....<br>but rather, how much we can SAVE every month.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
