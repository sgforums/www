Can never find it on this island, only in down under mate..! Once a WHITE SOARER, driven by an OZ driver ! smoked my skyline-GTS when i was staying in melb @M1 freeway. "RESPECT".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>As for resetting ECU, can head back to TC when you service your car and ask them to do so. Your next alterative is to go for e-management cost you abt $800. Aside from resetting you ECU ! You should understand the car characteristics, how it works or functions as you drive.<br><br>ECU reads your driving habits and also in other technical accepts of integrating other add on enhancement parts into your car.<br>Yes, you can reset and reset the ECU, but if you continue to drive it the same way, you wont feel any change.  ECU is like a CPU / OS in your computer. If you add new hardware you have to restart your com and synchronized the new hardware.<br><br>During 1k, 5k, 10k of running in your car. You should drive hard not sayang it.<br>But again no one ask you to floor the paddles until your car turns turtle or bleedÂ….!<br><br>The ECU will pick up your habits, if you dun drive a little harder .. the ECU will read yr usual (Max speed and the min Speed ) and average it out.<br>This will be your style/ habit of driving.<br><br>Test This ! ( those under 18, pls do not try this stunt ) !<br><br>For the rest of the new marchies... fyi ! for the old birds here it goes again.<br>- Try to go hard on your paddles and hold, you can try to listen to the car engine as it sounds off the high rev and low rev sound Â… becos the ECU can't read your now driving habit..."hard driving". The ecu chip is not use to it.... it may or may not happen.... To each it's own.<br><br>1st gear abt 25/km,<br>2nd gear 70/KM ( RPM 4.5K- 5K )<br>3RD grear 110/km ( RPM 4-5K)<br><br>when you drive normally the car will change gear from 1st gear 15/km, 2nd gear 35km, 3rd gear 65km. dun believe look at your speedo when you are driving normally with normal light footworks before you try the above.<br><br>If you dun want to drive hard or mod your car, dun need to upgrade or reset your ECU. The march ECU has limited ?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> ..... very basic chip. I Personnally reset my ECU 3x in 8months since i bought my car..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">.<br><br>The march is a 1.4 L / 975kg / 98 phb.<br>Weight to horse is abt 9.9kg per horse.<br>Any way the car was design for Europe urban driving, tight and short roads.<br>Good enough to drive around in SIN.<br><br>Honestly speaking , Ask Tedz he is a hard driver like me...!<br>the car is not under power, understand it and love it...!<br><br>Best pple to comment on performance is Lennie and boring silver..!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>1/2 down, 1 left.

The rebate is fix and it is the package. I dun think you can do away the 1k rebate is part of the program.<br><br>3. Refinance at 1.8%( depends ) reloan.<br>And full settlement of the total Principle amont load. And a penalty cost incured for your diedown period if it is not duel yet. All will be cost into the reloan program. Is not worth !!!!<br><br>4. Dun get hooked for the tying down period...!<br><br>5.
