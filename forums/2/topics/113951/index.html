            <div class='col-md body'>Info from the net :<br><br>OPEL's 240-horse Astra OPC will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show. The two-litre turbo is among the most powerful front-wheel-driven cars around, and is expected to clock a sub-seven 0-100kmh sprint and to top 240kmh. It is equipped with a six-speed manual box, 18-inch alloys and new instrumentation.<br><br>The car was co-developed by the Opel Performance Centre (Opel's answer to BMW's M division). Between 2001 and the end of last year, over 15,000 OPC models based on the Astra, Astra station wagon and Zafira were delivered.</div>
