            <div class='col-md body'>must compare apple to apple..how u wanna compare an ang moh liu lian and a real durian? of course, for IS's price back then; it was really valued for money. however there is no replacement for displacement. however very much depends on ur skills also la. any kuku can go fast on a straight road but from a straight road to a corner then out of a straight road? i think its the driver..not the car anymore.<br><br>anyway..i've got myself a 1.5L swift..lol..i think price wise its better then going for an 2nd hand IS. fast? there is always another car faster..(better specs i mean) so why bother? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

But then again, maybe he/she should be more graceful then to come in here and start this kind of senseless topic.<br><br>I am currently driving a SIS. Any questions maybe you can ask me, will try my best to answer.......... its just a simple little car with good power (sufficient to get ard with hell lotsa fun), without burning a hole in the pocket.

I don't own the road, either do the Rex or Evos, unless your ah kong owns one. Lets just enjoy our ride and stop all this 'nonsense'. There are bound to be black sheep in any make of cars, not only SIS.<br><br>And lastly, someone mentioned, the record hold by SIS in sepang is 2min 55 sec..................... not too sure if my record is updated, but thats achieved sometime back.

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't help but notice alot of you in this forum either long for a super Ah Beng WRX or a freaking Ah Huat EVO. Some try to be different by expressing their love for CELICAS and what-have you. What has become of the young crowd nowadays?<br><br>You guys are always giving the impression that you crave for speed, raw power.. the question is can you with your limited experience handle it?<br><br>Comparing these Ah Beng cars seems to boost your egos. I am darned sure none of you have been inside those cars that you so rightly claim you know so much about. Save it lah, brothers!</div>

I personally tested SIS and i like it alot especially on the pick-up wise, as for the back end.. does not reali have any power. i could say SIS is a sprinter rather then a all-rounder. tested 120kmh on the bend (exit clementi ave6 to imm) no problem at all.
