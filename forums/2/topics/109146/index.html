Now My SE just called me, telling me to perpare my payment + some other charges (guess is insurance).

Do you guys pay up immediately after getting your COE or just before getting your car? The SE told me he need to register now, but I thought the car needs to be there for registration?<br><br>Will be meeting my SE soon, so I would appreciate it if you guys could advise me before that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Confirm with your SE when you'll be getting your car.<br><br>Normally the car should already be physically here when the registration process is done.<br><br>However, I've heard that they need only the engine and chasis number to register the car to your name, but I don't think the SE will dare to do that before the car arrives in Sgp. What if the car is registered, and something cocks up during the journey to Sgp?<br><br>If you are getting the car only in Feb and it is registered now, you lose two months of usage time, not to mention depreciation.<br><br>Also, find out from the SE what fees you'd be paying.

But you might want to check that insurance, road tax should start only around the time you collect the car, if not on the same day. This is normally granted as the case, but in case there's cockups...<br><br>Cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Of course got the money, who dun want to buy a better car. It all boils down to bounded rationality, bounded mainly by cost where it is so high in SG. You probably have your chance of proving yourself correct when fuel cost hit sky-high...
