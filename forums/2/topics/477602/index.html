                  <blockquote>
                  <p>With the opening of the new Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE) from 9am on Sunday, 29 December 2013, motorists are reminded to take note of the following key changes, and make adjustments to their travelling routes, if needed.</p>
                  <p>Firstly, motorists travelling between the KPE / ECP and the AYE should use the MCE, as it will serve as the main expressway connecting traffic travelling between the east and the west.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, motorists travelling between AYE / ECP / KPE and the CBD can use the MCE to connect directly via Marina Boulevard and Central Boulevard. Depending on their destinations, motorists can also use other arterial roads.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, with the ECP ending west of Benjamin Sheares Bridge, motorist can continue to use the new arterial road, Sheares Avenue, to enter the CBD from ECP.</p>
                  <p><strong> Changes to ERP gantries when MCE opens </strong></p>
                  <p>As announced in May 2013, with the opening of MCE, LTA will adjust some of the existing ERP gantries on ECP as well as along the Shenton Way-Chinatown cordon to ensure that developments in the future Marina Downtown continue to be within the CBD and to manage traffic demand along key routes into and out of the CBD.
                  Motorists will not be unduly affected by these adjustments as there will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no changes</span> in ERP charges or operating hours.</p>
                  <p>Motorists will continue to pay the same prevailing ERP rates during operating hours when they use MCE or ECP to enter the CBD when MCE opens.</p>
                  <p>Motorists can refer to the <a title="LTA home page" href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en.html">LTA home page</a> for more information on the key changes.</p>

                  <p><em><span style="color: #808080;">Singapore's latest highway - the Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE) - opened to traffic on Sunday. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said traffic was smooth-flowing within the MCE tunnel.</span></em></p>
                  <p>SINGAPORE: Singapore's latest highway - the Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE) - opened to traffic on Sunday.</p>
                  <p>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said traffic was smooth-flowing within the MCE tunnel.</p>
                  <p>However, there were slowdowns near the expressway - along Central Boulevard and Marina Boulevard.</p>
                  <p>Motorists travelling to the Marina downtown now have direct access via the MCE.</p>
                  <p>The MCE links the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE), East Coast Parkway (ECP) and Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE).</p>
                  <p>Some motorists, however, seemed unfamiliar with how to enter the MCE.</p>
                  <p>Ms Caroline Cornelius Jones, a motorist, said: "Coming from the east was very easy. But, then I decided I'm going to go on a magical mystery tour. So, then (I) carried on around and decided to come off and head through Shenton (Way) and then it starts to get a bit tricky, because nothing is quite open yet. So, it took me like 20 minutes to come back again!"</p>
                  <p>Mr Raja Subramaniam, a motorist, said: "A bit confusing, I think for the meantime, after that (it) shouldn't be a problem... because the way they (the roads) are diverted to another place, so a bit confusing."</p>
                  <p>With the road network changes, motorists on the ECP need to take Exit 14B to enter the MCE, before connecting to the AYE.</p>
                  <p>To help motorists using the new expressway, traffic wardens were deployed and temporary signs put up at key approaches.</p>
                  <p>Motorists welcomed the opening of Singapore's 10th expressway.</p>
                  <p>Mr Chng Wee Seng, a motorist, said: "I stay in the west, if I take the AYE all the way here, normally I use 10 minutes to come in, but now five minutes only. Cut down about five (minutes), every trip."</p>
                  <p>The Marina Coastal Expressway is the widest highway in Singapore with five lanes in each direction.</p>
                  <p>It also has the smoothest road surface, the only public road which surpasses this standard is the Marina Bay Formula One Circuit.</p>
                  <p>The MCE was also conceived to help realise the vision of a new Downtown @ Marina Bay.</p>
                  <p>By putting the MCE underground, part of the ECP that currently cuts through the city centre, will be removed. This allows the old business district to seamlessly join the new downtown.</p>

The cars trying to go on the MCE (from Keppel Road) were diverted  to use another road, but my bus was led through to get onto the MCE, with the traffic officers literally moving away the bollards just to let the bus through! Soon on the right, I wowed at the seaview, the sea so close to an expressway! I immediately understood why it was name as such. Then, in the tunnel, I saw the illuminated exit signs and they reminded me of the USA signs somehow... Overall, MCE quite nice, just a pity it's mostly underground, so only got seaview at the ground level...</span></p></div>
