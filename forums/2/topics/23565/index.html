Then when i over took them, one of them sped up to in front of me, in my lane and slow down purposely. He got no pillion and he was on a NSR125. Then I Tulan lor, I guessed he wana race so i just lap him again. Then the race began. Another TZR (FJ561<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> came up. He was with a pillion. They two took on me lor. Since mine was a 150cc so i could win them through out lar. But then they were not faraway.

Sometimes, when circumstances takes over, we lose our rationality.<br><br>Exactly the reason why now i'm looking for a cruiser.  I don't want trouble, and I know I can't resist the urge to have a go if I'm on the road racer.  It has happened to me before.<br><br>Although being on a cruiser won't necessarily stop us from "racing", at least it'll lower down such occurances.  Rite?</div>

Then, they all ahead, cc bigger mah and some of them on AYE were at 170 kph. The this 2 'small kids' on a mito, one of them pillion wanna to lap me, ard 19 y/o. purposely slow down then speed up and look at me, did that a few times, I ignore them, continue on at 120kph. They have a friend in driving behid them in a BMW, 3 series car.<br><br>Then my friends go 99wan. They kids so happen also there. My friends slowed down and waited for me. The arseholes, wait for all my friends to pass, then he purposely cut in between me and my friends and lap me.<br>Crazy assholes, he pillion friend still go at high speed at 99wan and never brake. I let them win, what for risk you life for these assholes right? Somemore I am still getting used to my bike, just got it 2 weeks ago. But the friend in BMW could not ctach up with me, car cannot bank, and I can tell his driving skills not there. Auto gear car cannot cut corners well one. My friends slowed down later and I told them what happened and they wanted to lap them, I say what for? waste time and effort. Their cc so big, they sure eat smoke one.<br><br>So if anyone challenges you, ignore them, what do you gain out of it besides and ego boast? and the risk of losing your life or a limb, not worth it. If got pillion, you kill the pillion if kena accident, you will be in serious shit, prsion, fine, license revoked and banned. Not worth it.<br><br>Then my f</div>

The speed limit was 90 so I travelled at 90. Then saw this grp of Ah Bengs. When i say ah beng really ah bengs one! (Long Hair+Tattoo)They were travelling at something like 80 like that, so i was able to overtake them with ease lor even though i was still travelling at 90. Then when i over took them, one of them sped up to in front of me, in my lane and slow down purposely. He got no pillion and he was on a NSR125. Then I Tulan lor, I guessed he wana race so i just lap him again. Then the race began. Another TZR (FJ561<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> came up. He was with a pillion. They two took on me lor. Since mine was a 150cc so i could win them through out lar. But then they were not faraway. I my mind was that a 150cc can only win them such a small distance...SIAN ARGH!! MUST UPGRAGE! I was wondering if i was riding some tuagu, they dare to lap meh?? Damn!
