            <div class='col-md body'>Generally speaking, overdrive (O/D) is the highest gear in the transmission. On most cars the automatic transmission has 3 speeds and Overdrive (fourth speed). Overdrive allows the engine to have less rpm with higher speed in order to have better fuel efficiency. When you switch it on, you allow the transmission to shift into overdrive mode after the certain speed is reached. When it is off, you limit transmission shifting by third speed and dragging of gears can be noticed. In normal driving condition the overdrive should be always on. You may need to switch it off if you drive in mountaineous areas.<br><br><strong>Therefore, OD is engaged when you don't see any lights on your dashboard.</strong><br><br>This is a common misconception among a lot of people that OD is turned on when the lights are turned on and that includes my father.<br><br>Honestly, I do not see the point of having that OD switch. Reason being that it does not help in fuel efficiency and neither does it give extra power during overtaking(that's my opinion). If any of you own or have driven continental cars, they basically do not include that OD switch as the OD is already built into the transmission.<br><br>If the need for power arises during overtaking, don't bother pressing that OD switch thinking that OD is engaged. Just apply the normal kickdown method and power should be more than sufficient.<br><br></div>

Therefore having a manual override feature does not eliminate the overdrive feature at all.<br><br></div>
