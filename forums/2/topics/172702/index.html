My cousin exchanged  his 04 STI with me for a week. Great car to drive with little to complain bout.<br><br>Though the interior built quality isn't really up to scratch and creaking sounds can be heard especially on the central dashboard panel.<br><br>However, the boxer note is really puts a smile on ur face and AWD is really tops in the handling dept.<br><br>About the FC, I was gettin like 5-6 km/L.
