            <div class='col-md body'>from a lil boy's pt of view...<br><br>i've always loved this car from the start. never driven it, but it's no secret about its sweet performance, which is more or less derived from the jwrc racing version. thumbs up for its aesthetics, not loud, just nice enough with those kits, flared wheel arcs, and white rims.<br><br>problem is, you gotta have that passion for this ride. it costs abt 70k right? with this money, you have several other options of much spacious cars, altis etc. that's why i say, you gotta have the passion for its uniqueness, and not fret &amp; regret afterwards about its limited space.<br><br>still, in overall, a really desirable car. have the looks and the performance to match. unlike, ermmm, mazda? heez no offence...</div>

Plus buying a nice car is always going to cost you, first year value drop and so on. So don't think about saving money, cause you don't.<br><br>Downgrade? Both are from different catorgory, one family, one sport, so it is just changing car groups. SIS is also a 5 seater, my kelisa can sit in 5 adults (including driver) of average 70kg, SIS can't? Thinking about kids? If you don't have fun now, you never will.<br><br>I think the only concern is the 4 door become 2 door. Definitely troublesome for passenger to get in and out. Both driver paying, so driver's comfort is the only important factor. Anyway, the car has a decent resale market, so take good care of it, then you can always sell it off a few year later and "upgrade" to other cars.<br><br>SIS, youth rally car model, actually it is consider performance car, but of a different cat again.</div>

Time running out i guess, haha............... can't afford a better sport car at this moment anyway.<br><br>vi) Oh yes, is the SIS really consider PERFORMANCE car? some say its a coupe, some say its performance, some say a 3 door sedan, haha......... too many versions.<br><br>ANyway, at this moment of time, I'm still thinking......... heh...........</div></blockquote>I guess the first point already decide for you. Having that extra cash is going to be important. Even if you go a few thousand back, you wouldn't be able to down too much for SIS, meaning you have to take a bug loan for it and be stuck with it until it breaks even. Meaning with kids, also cannot sell. Think about it, with your loan on your present car so low, so when the kid cames, the car's installment should already be done, so that extra cash can go to the kids, "bird's saliva", "old ginger" (for your wife).<br><br>As for the place, any center passenger of the back of any car will feel uncomfortable. That is a fact. But are you buying a car to fetch people around? Driver's feel is top consideration.<br><br>Anyway, SIS is a model design for the youth rally tournament. So technically it is still a sports car. Until cars like Colt turbo, you see it in any race before?<br><br>My conclusion to you is do you have the MONEY to spare. Simply and straight.</div>

Quite like it, even though its not in the league of other performance car but the price as well.<br><br>Now the headache part is, I'm considering if I wanna buy this car, cause theorytically I am driving a better car now, and below are the factors that I consider comapre this two cars. My current ride is a 2nd hand 2001 Civic 1.5 Vti ES8 (Auto). Money wise about the same cause the car price drop significantly now so basically, the price of maintaining these two cars is about the same. So pls do not factor in price issue. Even insurance is about the same.<br><br>For the change:-<br>1) Old car (3 yrs 7mnths) change to a brand new one.<br>2) Sportier car (suits my age 25-30) , and four doors become two, haha.....<br>3) Faster car , more powerful then the civic ES8<br>4) If to keep my civic, need ard $1000-1500 for a big servicing cause of wear and tear.<br>5) All in one package, with sport rims, body kit, fog light all in already )thus save some money when got the car).<br><br>Against the change:-<br>1) Consider downgrade? (no offence to SIS owners, just opinion to some)<br>2) Big car change to smaller car.<br>3) 5 seaters become 4 seaters, troublesome if have kids in a few yrs time.<br>4) No doubt civic slower in pick-up, but more comfy over all, esp long drive.<br>5) Spend quite a sum of money on lips, for lights, spoiler, 16" rims and other accessories.<br><br>So guys and gals, will you guys change a 3 yrs old ES8 for a brand new IS if you are in my shoe? Appreciate all feedback.<br><br>Thank you.<br></div></blockquote>U like power? 2nd gear, 80Kmh @ 6000rpm no good enough. u can do better with a Vios 1.5 VVT-i. no need "sports".<br><br>But too bad its a normal sedan...

            <div class='col-md body'>Mach10,<br><br>Hi, thanks for your input as well. I test drove the Vios before also, an auto one at BM as itÂ’s the only car for test drove. Did it on behalf of a friend, who end up getting the manual one after consulting my advise as auto one is really weak (no offence pls, but comparing it with my civic the transmission is sure rough). I know that the manual one is cheaper (than the IS), and definitely more powerful than the auto and my auto Civic, but as you can see, the number of Vios out there as compared to an IS, is like ratio 20:1 ? MaybeÂ….. if I was to change a car, will make my car a not so common one on the road. Also, IS is more powerful than the Vios cause of the short ration between the gears.<br><br>Actually a few yrs back, Civic is not so common still until of recent one-two yrs, when the car price drop, then Civic start to get common. And I do agree with Wbucket for sure. To change a sedan to a sedan (Civic to Vios), its really a comparable downgrade. No offence once again as I find Vios a decent car too, just stating the fact and feel from my point of view. So I wonÂ’t consider a Vios at this moment of time.<br><br>Wbucket,<br><br>You are right, itÂ’s the feeling that counts. I always like fast car, and esp so after driving my brother SS2. Now got more kick for it. The feeling on the IS is nowhere close to the SS2 but for the price, I find it more than terrific, haha, especially the responsiveness of the ISÂ…Â…Â…. If IÂ’m still single, then maybe I wonÂ’t Â‘thinkÂ’ this much. My advise for those single driver who loves to have some trills. Go for the IS, itÂ’s a good buy, esp now that its at 63k region. One yr ago it was ard 71-73k I believe. And yes, the car is not so common.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, I just realized something today. While driving on the road this morning (at Woodlands), I saw an accident. The back of an Opel Corsa (hatchback) got badly smashed. It woke me up a little. Imagine if I have a small kid sitting right at the back of the IS, and it was involved in this accident (touch wood), I really canÂ’t imagine the impact on my kid. Maybe a hatchback is still not so good afterall for a family man, just my 2 cents worth.<br><br>Still like the IS, but after this morning, guess the urge to change to an IS has dropped at this moment of time. Heard COE is coming out soon, and we shall see how it goes, no hurry at this moment of time, at least I still have my civic around.<br><br>Anyway, once again thanks all for your kind input. Cheers~!<br></div>
