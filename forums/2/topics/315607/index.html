              <p>1) I think it is absolutely fine to pump fuels from different companies. But people just don't like to change company, dunno why. Petrol is petrol, no difference in chemical make up even if it's different companies like Shell, Caltex, Esso, etc. The only diffference is the RON rating.</p>
              <p>The only thing that's going to harm the engine is too low octane, causing the engine to knock. So be sure to read your car's manual to find out what's the lowest RON rating your car's engine can take. Usually the higher the capacity the engine is, it will need fuel of higher RON rating. Small engines maybe minimum RON92, bigger engines maybe minimum RON95.</p>
              <p>2) Not too sure whether Shell or Esso is better. But a lot of people say Shell's petrol is more powerful, no matter is it RON95 or RON98.</p>
              <p>And I think this is because when you see the fuel says RON98, it does not necessarily mean the fuel has an octane rating of exactly 98, it might be a bit more or less. RON98 is just naming the fuel. So maybe Shell's Formula98 has a higher octane maybe at 98 point something and maybe other companies' RON98 fuel only has 97.9807 (example only).</p>
              <p>This is just my simple explanation, explaining why maybe you'll feel Shell's fuel is more powerful than other companies' fuel of similar rating of RON98.</p>
              <p>But I personally feel Shell's fuel is the most powerful among the different petrol companies in SG.</p>

              <p>why? - company offer better offers? points to exchange goodies?</p>
              <p>The petrol is almost the same... For most car 95 is enough, even you pump 98 you may end up damaging your car, do you know that? i remember reading the newpaper article challenge from sg to kl there... So really depends, most car will go well with 95.</p>

              <p>Hi alleggerita,</p>
              <p>So generally speaking, petrol with higher octane provides better power. But what about some comments saying it's possible for 98 and above types to damage your engine (read Banghong)?</p>
              <p>If V power provides better FC, then I may think of switching over from 95. 95 is cheaper, but FC is lousier. V Power more expensive, but better power and FC. If that's the case, might as well go for a better grade? I'm driving a 2.0 tucson.</p>

              <p>I recommend you calculate just how much fuel can you save when compared to using Formula95. Then see how long you'll need to break even from spending extra paying for V-power. If it takes too long like 2-3 years, forget it. Stick with Formula95. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I've never heard of engines getting damaged by fuels of too high octane. Only too low an octane will damage the engine due to engine knocking. In UK, they even have RON100 fuel. Heard it makes the car much more powerful than pumping RON98 fuel.</p>
              <p>Added: I believe high octane won't damage engine. Because an engine with minimal modifications (mostly modifications to the fuel supply line only) can take methanol as an alternative fuel. And methanol can reach RON115.</p>

              <p>all petrols are the same....</p>
              <p>and regarding the ron ratings.. i think allgeritia has got it
              spot on...</p>
              <p>most people tend to wrongly associate high octane(ron) ratings
              with higher performance....</p>
              <p>truth is only high performance cars with high compression
              engines need fuel with high octane rating...</p>
              <p>so i guess this is where all the misunderstanding arose
              from...</p>
              <p>i am driving an altis 1.6.. i read the manual.. and it might
              shock a lot of people here but the recommended octane rating for my
              engine is 91....</p>
              <p>so actually 92 is enough but to be on the safe side 95 is
              reccomended.. but with the ever increasing petrol prices i might
              have to think twice now...</p>

              <p>Quite true. Advice from some folks at the petrol kiosks once said there is no need for high octane petrol unless it's for continental cars.</p>

              <p>And the reason why continental cars usually need fuels with higher octane rating is because they usually have large engine capacities like the 525i, S350, 730Li, A8 3.2, etc.</p>
              <p>But even the smaller capacity continental cars don't necessarily need fuels with high octane rating. Like the 320i, C180K/C200K, Golf 1.6/1.4/2.0, etc. RON95 should be more than enough.</p>
              <p>For my father's Kia Picanto 1.1, only RON92 is needed. For my uncle's S40 2.4i, minimum is RON95, RON92 might cause knocking.</p>

              <p>Doesn't sound like it's going to make much difference in the end. Guess I'll try it out for a month. If cost differences are not worth it, then it makes sense to stick to 95 since petrol costs are escalating so quickly!</p>

              <p>And I believe in the latter. Keeping the tank full will only add weight to the vehicle and increase FC. Keeping fuel in the tank low will keep weight down and reduce FC.

              <p>That was my take initially until one old guy at the workshop said it really depends on how you look at it because with fuel sloshing about in the tank, apparently the lesser fuel left, the more violent the sloshing, FC is affected as well.</p>
              <p>I have no idea how accurate that theory is, a little warped maybe?</p>
