            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I didnt know that you can drive G plate vehicles into Malaysia.  I wanted to drive my Opel van (similar to the belingo) into JB cos my car was being repainted there.  So I called up our side of the cause way and they said no problem but need to check with the malaysian side.  Called up JB and they said they do not permit singapore goods vehicle ie G plate cars into Malaysia blah blah blah... gave up.<br><br>So if you managed to find out how your friend did it or what permit etc to apply, will appreciate if you can post it here so more people can know.<br><br>As for time it takes, well its further than you think.  Its at least 320/330 km away and that is from the road markers signages which I suspects does not include city driving ie from start of toll to end of toll.  So the last time, I did about 110 took me over 4.5 hours plus breaks.  Oh, driving in KL can be a night mare.  even the locals sometimes gets lost and the traffic jams are bad!  Problem is that there are alot of spaghetti flyovers with lots of entries, so if you exit one too early or too late... good luck!  my friend's house was 10 mins from my hotel, took 1 turn too early ended up on the road to ipoh.  lucky found a way to turn back and proceeded to view KL via the ring road, that is to say, circled the outer borders of KL.  10 mins drive ended up 1.5 hrs and that is on a sunday morning with absolutely no traffic.  So go traffic jam... die die.<br><br>good luck and yes its quite fun but plan ahead and get a really really really really good map!<br><br>franzx</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree to have a really really updated map...to imagine that I bought the map from Singapore and most of the roads cannot be found there...gosh..what a nightmore..<br><br>Like the other said tt it could be a 10 mins drive but end up 1.5 hours...got that experience too...<br><br>Can check from the LTA website...they are the ones who is issuing the license.... www.lta.gov.sg<br><br>Also, I would suggest that you rent a vehicle rather than driving a van there as the van might not be able to take the distance...It's about 300 over km from 2nd link...<br><br>It's cheaper to rent from JB if you really want....safer too as the other road user might thought that you are one of the Kahkis.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
