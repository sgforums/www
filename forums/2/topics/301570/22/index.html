It is more expensive than the GT3. But i think GT3 looks nicer than 997 turbo. More sporty look.<br><br>Yes, i agree with you. I hate it when manufactures make so many differnt variants of the same model. Mercedese and BMW are the kings. Lexus is following suit. Makes it so difficult to identify and differeniate the different variants. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally i think Mercs and BMW are fine. They have a standard model and they just offer different engine sizes and a sports model. For example, BMW has the 520i, 523i, 525i, 530i, 545i and the mighty M5.<br><br>Whereas for Porsche, the 997 Carrera alone has so many variants. You have the 2 wheel drive, 4 wheel drive, S variant (which also comes in 2/4 wheel drive), turbo variant, lightened chassis variant (GT3) and lately the lighten-lightened variant (GT3 RS).

            <div class='col-md body'>Any Porsche fan will know they repeat this for every cycle model. 911 Carrera, Carrera 4, Carrera S, Carrera 4 S, GT3, GT3 RS, Turbo, GT2. Then the Carrera is available in Coupe, Cabriolet &amp; Targa. 911 GT2 is priced above the Turbo &amp; is considered top of the line regular production model. But i find the limited edition's model name is confusing to ppl. Such as 911 GT1 &amp; Carrera GT. They just keep using the name Carrera &amp; GT... they dun go think of other names meh? Hahaha...</div>

So for the second time i did make a appointment and manage to get in with a some sort of a tour guide to show me around. I manage to make friend with that person and i contact him directly for my 3rd visit instead of the usual phone in to the office.<br>The guard is unavoidable as that is the only way to enter.
