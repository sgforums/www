              <p><br>Yeah, it was one of the 26 Transsyberias that took part in the  rally that spans from Russia to Mongolia. So far I only know that the engine is practically stock and its capable of running a mix of gasoline and ethanol. It's really a rally machine, with all that beefed up parts and lightened stuff.</p>

              <p>Ah ya that odd-colour RR DHC, hope its for export. I saw the colour of the canvas... yeah the overall colour package is not to the taste of many people <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>I think you're a little confused... the RSR is a pure circuit race car. Yes I took this pic in the main Porsche workshop. And I just found out that it had just taken part in the 24Hr Dubai 2008 race. Look under #33</p>

              <p>The Cayenne S Transseyberia is a special that was made to compete in The Rally Transsyberia 2007.

              <p>I think it's a new car. I spotted near Lucky Plaza once. Never seen an orange Murcielago around Singapore before.</p>
              <p>Two things could've happened:</p>
              <p>He sped and lost control</p>
              <p>-OR-</p>
              <p>The parts are faulty since Lamborghinis, like most other exotic cars, are hand built.</p>
              <p>Heard that some Gallardos experience their engines setting on fire.</p>

              <p>Theres a few orange Murcie's here, I know there was at least 2 orange LP640's at one point as well as a couple older gen ones.</p>
              <p>I think there was a high chance he might have been speeding and lost control. But then someone might also have cut into his lane, or something like that. Or maybe someone was trying to get a bit too close to look at the car, or was driving recklessly to get next to him or in front of him or something. Stuff like that happens quite a bit I'm guessing with expensive cars. But then since he seems to have left the scene quickly and noone else was involved, I guess his own fault nd probably speeding</p>

              <p>"rev!rev!REV!REV!REV!REV!"  i thought just another ducati with straight pipes showing off by short revving real hard from the underground carpark opposite paragon.</p>
              <p>while walking, i keep turning my head back to see the "ducati". must be a fast one.</p>
              <p>turns out to be a murcie. beautiful bronze rims. sorry, video wasn't clear. wanted to take photos, but rather take video as the sound was really sexy. he didn't rev hard once outside carpark.</p>

The lights went green, and with no other traffic obstructing it, a dark grey Gallardo Superleggera blasted past and roared off towards Holland area. Sounded so loud and amazing. This isn't the grey one thats been spotted before btw with the indian owner, but one that stays near Chip Bee gardens</p></div>
