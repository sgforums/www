            <div class='col-md body'>If you really looking for a 2.0 with the type of specs u looking for.. i tink camry is just nice. How many other types of 2.0 models can u see in sg? mercs? cefiro?706? accord? ford? rover? I think those brands i mention above you will not want it. If you wan cheaper there are some which cost less for eg. Hyundai Santa fe around 70k. Cheaper price but swallows petrol like water 1liter=7km... lolz.. If u wan FC low... that leaves out all the korean cars. Look for Jap car. Or unless you wan to get the Mazda 6 2.0 normal version. cost around 80k. Comsumption about 5-8% higher than camry.<br><br>Look around some more and ask some more... which car got VVTI engine, low FC on a 2.0, smooth engine running even when u r @ 120, its quite spacious too. But if u get the 2.4 camry, u will tink that its something like the new Beemer 5 series with more gadgets inside.. cozz they copy on the steering wheel on the controllers &amp; buttons. But overall if u r looking for a good car, sometimes u may need to fork out more. Insurance and road tax, no choice one. Driving a car in SG is luxury. Need to spend around 15K a yr on petrol+parking+cashcard+insurance+roadtax+mantainance...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks! Good to read a well-thought through input!<br><br>Yup... I had been thinking of Camry but just didnt want to contaminate the thinking / input with my prior opinion.<br><br>I reckon Camry's VVTi engine would probably help in FC but there's another car that has a VVT engine as well... Hyundai NF Sonata... going for 77k... If the specs are correct, the difference in superior FC will not outweigh the price difference...<br><br>I say it's at max a SGD 5k difference over 10 years for FC superiority. Camry is at 90k... so there is a huge 13k difference that I'm trying to justify in my mind and why I consider it overpriced.<br><br>Downside of Hyundai is the spartan features (eg. Manual aircon, lack of cruise control, untested reliability, etc)<br><br>Had thought about Mondeo (82k) and Mazda6 (78k) as well but again, didnt want to prejudge... keen to hear opinions of others like yourself.<br><br>More considered opinions? Hoping to tap on the collective wisdom of folks here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hyundai.. r u sure... cozz for what i kno about korean cars is that in terms of durability its not really on the top list. Getting spare parts is not ez too.<br><br>Although price may be the pinch but if u r looking @ the type of specs which you wan, i would advise you to get the camry.<br><br>About 1.6 cars... actually there r some models which u can consider... some of engines still can run smoothly at 120km. For eg. Lancer, Altis , focus , vtis. I personally tink the altis would make a good choice. Lancer and vtis engines after long run and 3 yrs down the road will sound like a lion roar when u hit high rpm. Ford focus new type seems no bad too... but have not really tried it out yet.. Y i say lancer roars is simple.. i drive my house car regulary and starting to find some of the problems which is gonna happen soon although its less den 1 yr old .. lolz... tried 5k rpm.. u can hear it roar... lolz...<br><br>But if u r getting a automatic car... i dun tink it will be a big problem.. cozz normally if u step gradually... the throttle level will go smoothly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'm not sure... which is why I've been pondering for a while... looking for expert advise on this...<br><br>However, the NF Sonata has been well rated and was called the Korean Camry.... But when I looked at the specs... the version that they are selling in the US is far superior than what they are offering here.... so dont know... Sat in quite a few of the old Sonatas and thought they're ok (but high FC).<br><br>And Mazda6 price has dropped... suspect because 2006 model coming... but then again, not sure about its NVH level.<br><br>Drove the Ford Mondeo before for 3 hours straight but felt very tired after the journey... heavy vehicle....<br><br>As for 1.6 vehicle... I seriously doubt Lancer has lower NVH than my currrent Protege... Sat in one before and thought it was quite noisy... As for Ford Focus and Mazda3, had thought about it as well but NVH, while probably better than my current model, would still be quite high at high RPM... Moreover, the poor power / weigh ratio would mean that they are very slow so... As for Altis, not sure... sat in a few in Thailand... but dont know... no strong opinion... Not sure about NVH at &gt;100kmph... traffic in Bangkok is never so fast....<br><br>More considered opinions?</div>
