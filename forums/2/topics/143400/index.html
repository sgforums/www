The Cefiro 200JK has also been recently equipped with Cruise. You might want to try the Accord 2.4 or the Peugeot 407 2.0 too, although the 2.2 might be a better choice but of course with a heftier price tag.</div>

However, the 500 and mondeo are totally different cars. 500 being a larger car and targetted at the american market.
