Toyotas have very low OMV because Borneo fits almost all accessories in singapore. leather seats,stereo,wood trim, rims and tyres,reverse sensor etc.<br><br>that's why most german cars have such high OMV, their euip being factory fitted.<br><br>you should not make a decision based on everything you read in here. nobody here will go to the trouble to get hard specs for you unless he stands to gain from it.</div>

The woe on me aside, I think what is most regretable is really the impact on consumers at large in Singapore.<br><br>Even although Singapore consumers pay the most for our cars and dealers here earning comparably one of the highest profit margins around the world, the quality of the info / specs offered is just lacking / poor for consumers like you and me.<br><br>The market definitely needs more quality info, independent reviewers to boost competition and benefit consumers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And one other point... in the US, contrary to what some may believe, most folks dont buy vehicles on the internet too...<br><br>What they do is do lots of research on the vehicles and then validate their beliefs later in the showrooms before making the purchase.<br><br>Helps to mitigate 'rash' decisions...<br><br>Sophisticated buyers can only be sophisticated with better, more informed choices.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>i guess why the quality of info available is poor is down to the mentality of the majority of Singaporean consumers. A car dealer once told me many Singaporeans just buy the car based on the design. If nice they buy, no questions asked. Since this happens so often it is probably why the dealers dont bother to offer in depth detail anymore. Singaporeans also decide on the car by looking at how many are there on the road. "If so many on the road must be good what"<br><br>Singaporeans should really shop like bearbear_sg because we are paying so much more than other countries. It is only right to think carefully before buying and always remember to test drive.<br><br>P.S. If someone mentioned before about this haha im sorry</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, nothing beats a test drive, talking to other owners who owned it for a few years - you can find out from car owners forum and other countries test reports.

            <div class='col-md body'>Based on your Selection Criteria:<br>- Car I've tested: Mazda6 and NFSonata (less than 30 minutes)<br><strong>A. Value-for-money</strong>: NF&gt;6 (NF is real discounted stuff)<br><br><strong>B. Reliability</strong>: 6&gt;NF(this need some history)<br><br><strong>C. Silence / Quietness</strong>: NF&gt;6 (NF was really great for noise troubleshooting)<br><br><strong>D. Fuel Consumption</strong>: NF&gt;6 (Hyundai's new 2.4 seems greate job, I heard it's over 10km/l). It seems likely that they are aiming high and this promises diminishing the gaps between Hyndai and Jap competitor/European.<br><br><strong>E. Safety</strong>(ABS, EBD, Brake Assist must-have. ESP - good to have. Driver airbag must have. Additional airbags good to have): NF&gt;6 (standard kit of NF seems great) and only NF seems satisfying your expection.<br><br><strong>F. Others</strong> - Have cruise control as part of package to help in long trips up north: No idea. I wonder whether we can find any car in SG which has cruise control.<br><br>Plus,<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">G. Styling</span>(aesthetic view)<br>a. 6: 2 years ago it was (I though) as nice as bmw, it's already blend style. However this car still looks sportier than NF.<br>b. NF: IMO, one of best design among this category (Uniformaty, masculine, for some sence luxurious) and it was outstanding on the road even car park. Deep blue or dark cinnamon colour I like. This seems more family oriented compared with 6.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">H. Psychological factor</span>: 6&gt;NF (as singaporean put on air on Jap's thing and 6 seems younger image zoom-zoom factor i think).<br><br>my target in 2006 is (don't be confused though it's all different segment cars) ,<br>- NF Sonata<br>- Golf 2.0 FSI<br>- Civic 2.0 to come (i like honda cars based on my experience)<br>-  SantaFe to come<br><br></div>
