I believe @93k, the passat comes with the lower specs 2.0l engine.  The Skoda comes with the 1.8 20V turbo (light pressure) engine (err.. in case u r not aware.. this is the same 1.8 turbo found in the more expensive passat.. skoda is owned by VW).  Car is alot bigger too.. especially riding at the back.. feels like the BMW 735iL.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As for FC, you will be supprised how fuel efficent conti cars are nowadays (due to the extremely strict emmission control in europe.. oh.. do you know how much pertol cost in europe? hehe)<br><br>Of coz.. the skoda resale value not as good as the rest.. but then.. these days.. all cars also no resale value lah.. hahaa.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The current Passat 2.0 is actually targetting the Japanese large car market like cefiro and camry. The 93k Passat 2.0 has a less than enthusiastic engine to be honest. <strong>The future Passat 2.0 FSI is the car targetting at a more upscale market like Audi A4 BMW 3 series and Mercedes C class.</strong> This car does have upscale features as those featured on the Phaeton.<br><br>If the Passat 2.0FSI is going for 93k and has features similar to the Phaeton, then what is the current Golf 1.6FSI doing at 90 odd k too? The 2.0FSI is most probably going to be a premium model priced over a 100k for sure.<br><br></div>

It is feature packed to say the least. Continental build and handling and priced just slightly higher than most 1.6 Japanese cars. Comes with 6 airbags too if I am not wrong. Only problem is that Renault is not very well known to be a reliable and trouble free car like other Japanese cars.</div>
