              <p>Judging from that windscreen, the head could have hit it quite badly.</p>
              <p>Yeah, I pretty much guessed he was speeding to have caused that impact. But we cannot always blame the driver in such an accident. If the victim was jaywalking, the driver is not completely in fault. Moreover its at night.</p>

              <p>Although I dunno the exact details too, I am sure as we are driving at night, we ought to drive more cautiously and slowly to look out for any people crossing the road without any safety regard. Even if the driver were to hit a jaywalking pedestrain, at slower speed, maybe the pedestrain will at most suffer bruises...at least he won't die.....</p>
              <p>But from the news report, the pedestrian died and the car is rather badly smashed, hence, I dun feel the driver had any safety regards for others too.</p>

              <p><span>By Sujin Thomas<br> AN Indian national was killed on Saturday after he was hit by a
              Ferrari along Clementi Road.<br> Mr S Raja, a 22-year-old construction worker, was crossing the
              street near the Japanese School at about 8pm when he was struck by
              the sports car.<br> <br> He was flung several metres and died on the spot from severe head
              injuries.<br> <br> He was crossing the street with a colleague from construction firm
              Sato Kogyo. The other man was not injured in the collision.<br> <br> The 37-year-old driver of the Ferrari was arrested and is assisting
              police with investigations.<br> <br> The car had a shattered windscreen and a damaged front bumper. Its
              left rear-view mirror was also ripped off.<br> <br> According to the New Paper, a co-worker said Mr Raja had been in
              Singapore for almost two years and was looking forward to going
              home after earning some money.<br> <br> 'Now it will never happen,' he said.</span></p>

              <p>it's not just the ah nehs ok .. on my way home 2nite, i nearly hit a stupid chinaman on a bicycle - the asswipe was cycling against the flow of traffic, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the middle of the lane</span>, near the expressway turnoff. as you drivers know, exit @ 50km/hr .. if he was cycling at the exit, and *CHOY* i did hit him, he would survive .. but this moron was cycling just off the turnoff, on the road which is 70km/hr .. i had just come off the expressway and was accelerating to that speed. just thinking of the consequences had i hit that villager gets me really angry - he could have ruined my life. in case u're wondering, i did not see him at all .. he was wearing our army uniform (as many of these labourers do), and it was very dark.</p>
              <p>i drive a high-powered vehicle .. the moment i get slightly heavy-footed, the turbo kicks it on it's own with little lag. i cannot even begin to fathom the reaction time of a car 5x the cost of mine.</p>
              <p>anyway, until fault is apportioned, my condolences to the indian national's family. even if it was 100% his fault, my sincere respects.</p>

              <p>dunno if anyone here was on the CTE around the upp serangoon exit tonight @ 10.45 - saw a maserati driver doing at least 120k/hr, waving in and out of traffic w/o signalling or grace time. i don't mean to stereotype, but it's undeniable that with the smaller base group, these incidences do exponentially increase with the cost of the car.</p>

              <p>i'm not digging the replies regarding how these foreginers should "paint himself" like one and other comments. we all jaywalk.</p>
              <p>we would never know if the situation the victim was in was very SPLIT-SECOND. imagine, "no cars, let's cross." suddenly a car speeds round the bend or down the straights and a life is lost in just the blink of an eye. i have absolutely no pity for the F430.</p>
              <p>just like the movie i saw, "are we there yet?". where these two kids create hella of a havoc and eventually got Ice Cube's Lincoln Navigator with expensive spinners up in flames..</p>
              <p>Ice Cube simply uttered with no regrets, "It's okay kids. It's just a material thing."</p>
