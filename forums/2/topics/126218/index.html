            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest you go for newer cars like Vios. $50K plus relatively affordable. Compare to 2nd hand cars as the pricing of COE had drop quite drastically from 2002 onwards. Pricing of 2nd hand cars might not be that worth it afterall.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup.. nissan has high FC, not coz i only hear pple say. But my frens who drive nissans are rather petrol guzzlers!<br><br>Since it's more of a sales job, I would recommend toyota cars. Like the corolla or altis. There r 2nd hand cars here n there. But bear in mind 2 things:<br><br>1) Interest rates for 2nd hand cars are more. I believe currently it's 3% for used cars compared to 2.5%/2.75% for new cars. The extra amt of interest u might be paying could offset the higher initial cost of new cars of similar range<br><br>2) COE amt left. COE has straight line depreciation. A used car may seem cheaper but it's because it has a short life span compared to new car of 10yrs. Hope u get what i'm driving at, basically work out ur finances properly first before signing.<br><br>Get toyota Corolla or Vios if possible. Corolla altis is a very good buy, refined n comfortable for that price.<br><br></div>

Since it is your first car you shld get cars with high trade value so tat you will have a higher overtrade for the next one to come.<br>If u seriously looking for second hand cars why not try toyota G9 those in 2002,2003. The ones before altis is launched.</div>
