            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, this is my story, my mother planned to change car due to the low coe and that the current car is really old.So, my friend's father is a sell car de...He is very persuasive and phsycho my mother very fast to buy car from him.My mother then ordered Toyota Corolla-Altis(non-luxury) from him on 3rd March this year.He called my mother on 28 March to say that he had bidded for coe and got it.My mother's friend ordered Toyota Corolla-Altis(lux) on 6 March from BM and also got the coe bidded on 28 march.She recieved the car on 7 April but my mother have heard no news from my friend's father who is selling the car.My mother also send a cheque of 15k+ to his company but not BM, and my mother who worries about everything, is getting real worried about why she is not paying it to BM.And, my mother friend bought her lux altis at $58661 but my mother got her non-lux version at $58488 which should actually be lower by the lux version by $1200+... now the problem is that.. its already 21 March yet my friend's father still can't give a fixed date to collect the car. My mother is now worried about the 15k+ that she signed to the company and that her car is just like 200 dollars cheaper than a lux version, and she haven't got the car that she ordered and her friend already gotten it like 2 weeks ago! my mother tried calling my friend's father, but he is not sure about everything.<br>Please advise me on what to tell my mother so as to calm her down as she is very worried... although i am also quite worried about why we have not got the car yet.<br>And 1 more thing, can anyone tell me if they know any car company by Tan Wei Credit Pte Ltd, can it be trusted ? This seem strange and i hope sgf-er's may help me.<br><br>Sorry for long post,Thanks in adv.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...this will be quite hard. Your mum has paid a deposit and have a sales agreement...hrmm.... well..what u can do is to go to the dealer and demand for the date of the car. He cannot give answer like not sure..dunno...If he still say not sure or dunno... bring it to CASE and lodge a complain. How can buy car but no confirm date. Even if no confirm date, at least must be able to stipulate the grace period for it. BM has lots of altis and I dun think it need to wait for so long especially when the coe is bidded.  As for the price, that will be your bad luck, as its under the sale agreement which your mum had sign. At the most you can do is bargain with him...but may not actually work.<br><br>Another alternative is to check with BM to see if the agent who sold you that car, did he really ordered for it or not.</div>
