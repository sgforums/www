            <div class='col-md body'>Sweden leads the world in traffic safety research and has the objective of zero traffic fatalities by 2020 (rather ambitious objective but great if that can be done). This is about one such trials at the University of Lund on ISA (intelligent speed adaptors):<br><br>http://www.imita.se/pdf/isa_lund_eng.pdf</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More research findings from Sweden:<br><br>For drivers who tend to comply with speed limits in any case, ISA makes little difference. For ISA to be effective against the group of drivers most likely to flaunt speed limits, a mandatory limiting system is the key:<br><br>"The results of this study suggests that the AAP has the effect of reducing the speeds of<br>drivers who want to comply with the speed limit, but for drivers who deliberately exceed<br>the speed limit the effect is much less, which suggests that a limiting system is necessary<br>to make these drivers comply with the speed limit."<br><br>(See:http://www.ectri.org/liens/yrs05/Session%201/hjamdahl.pdf)</div>

Scientific studies have proven you wrong time and again:<br><br>"Several studies have shown that there is a <strong>clear</strong> relationship between the speed level and the number of accidents; even small changes in the speed level result in significant changes in the number of accidents (see e.g. SalusjÃ¤rvi, 1981; Nilsson, 1982; Elvik, Vaa and Ã–stvik 1989; Finch, Kompfner, Lockwood and Maycock, 1994; Kimber, 1990; OÂ’Neill, 1990).<br><br>FinchÂ’s summary of the US and German interstate/autobahn evidence is that a 1 mph decrease in mean traffic speed leads to a reduction in fatalities in the order of 8-10%. He also cites a number of statistical models which suggest (1) a 5% rise in accidents for every 1 mph increase in mean traffic speed; (2) that the change in the accident rate is a power function of the change in the median traffic speed; and (3) that assuming there are asymptotic limits to the relationship, the maximum expected percentage change in accidents associated with a large increase in speeds would be 28%, while for a large decrease this figure would be 25%."<br><br>Ref:<br><br>SalusjÃ¤rvi, M.

Of course we can believe that it wonÂ’t work, but no harm giving it a pilot trial. <span style="color: red;">As far as possible, I will try not to resort to personal attacks and insults </span> but I have long ago noticed that there is one particular person in this forum who donÂ’t see eye to eye with my view, with that, I can still tolerate and donÂ’t give a damn but what makes me pissed up is that this bugger keeps calling me a retard incessantly on many occasions and IÂ’m beginning to mark this fella. <span style="color: red;">If i am not wrong, he is merely a damn pathetic chee bye kuku bird lan jiao sicko filthy lowly sore dumbass maniac who has kenna traffic accident before I hope the chicken farts into his big lame mouth and his penis drops into the toilet bowl.</span></div></blockquote>ah, the mark of a true retard. preach something he cannot do himself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>that person who can't see eye 2 eye with u is me. dun have 2 beat about the bush. i already lashed out at ur ridiculous mentality several times b4, u think i care whether u mark me anot?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>but as far as <strong>YOU</strong> are concerned, u are obviously marked by more than a few person on this forum already. doesn't dat say something about u? or are retards excused from self awareness?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>look, with speed limitors implemented across the board, u think we still need tps on the roads to enforce rules? or u expect them all downgrade to give out parking tickets? then parking attendant do wat? help ppl wash car at carpark? then bangla do wat? go rob and rape to make a living?<br><br>every action has a cause and effect. implementing one "universal law" may suit one inconsiderate road hog juz fine, but not when it also has a domino effect on the population at large.<br></div>

And our roads will not be able to speed up to the max as stated on the car info sheets. So dealer can xian you if he wants.
