            <div class='col-md body'>SO bottom Line is to educate the Public that driving dangerously can kill u or other road users.....and i say again speeding is not necessarily the main cause of accidents....let me give u an true example....In england...there is one state which increased the Number of speed cameras to discourage speedsters but guess what? death rates from accidents increased by 14%!!! while another state which did nothing,its death rates from accidents decreased by 6%.....So u can't really stereotype....many of us here have already agreed that having such a system is really pointless and trust me in england they have thought abt it but then they reconsidered as its impractical....and If those fellas wanna drive dangerously and kill themselves thats their prob as they dun treasure their lives....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look, no one here can really conclude speed limiters wonÂ’t work until itÂ’s made a reality in the near future, with the statistics compiled. ThatÂ’s why I advocate its implementation, unless it results in more dire situations. Whatever factors that may come into the picture, itÂ’s still a fact that in general, higher speed, higher impact and high damage done. Mind you, this speed limiters is targeted at mitigating only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">speed-related fatal incidents</span>, and has no intention to take care of those aggravating factors that most of you like to quote. It is only one of the many measures the government is considering, coupled by many other regulations. Aggravating factors such as point of contact, human errors, driverÂ’s age and health, road conditions are curbed specifically by other laws such as alcoholic test, banned usage of handphones when driving, medical checkup and other road enhancement projects. So i don't really understand why does that gentleman bring aggravating factors into the picture when the topic is only restricted to speed-related accidents. The examples he quoted seems common-sense to all, even a primary school kid knows that a drunkard driving slowly at 60 is more susceptible to a collision than a sober person speeding at 100. In case he really got confused, may i hereby remind him that speed limiter device is only aimed at tackling <span style="text-decoration: underline;">speed-related accidents</span>, not to minimize accidents arising from point of contact, human errors, political etho, driver's health.<br><br>Idea of speed limiter is similar to fastening of seat-belts and wearing helmets when riding. In many unfortunate circumstances, they canÂ’t really prevent you from getting killed but better be safe than sorry. LetÂ’s just take it as an effort by the government to mitigate colliding situations. Similar to deploying armed security personnels to prowl airports and MRT stations, do you really they can really avert a massive bomb attack if someone were to stage it?? I bet majority of public would think this wonÂ’t work and is a wastage of cost and manpower, but the government still implement it, and I see no reason why the general public should oppose to these ideas unless they make things worst.<br><br>Just like the danger of holding a handphone when driving, you guys can argue that itÂ’s the skills of the driver that count, but eventually, there still remains a fact that in reality it diverts attention away from the driver, and increases the probability of losing control of the car. In the end, the government still makes it an offence, despite the fact that it hinders crucial communication flow and disrupts important business activities and is no good for our economy. I know a lot of you guys don't like it, but it's still an offence.<br><br>I understand most of us wonÂ’t like a mandatory device to be installed in our car to limit its performance, afterall we pay for our own cars with our hard-earned money and why should they have the right to even touch and modify its mechanism within. But mind you, the car may belong to us, our driving licence still belong to the government and they can take it away from you as and when they like, and mind you, the roads that our cars are traveling on belong to the government, not us.<br><br>Look at those visual entertainment system installed on those modern cars, most of you will find it absurd that these gadgets are actually viewed negatively by our traffic enforcers who think it will ultimately bring perils to our roads and result in more accidents. And again, you guys will say itÂ’s dependent on aggravating factors such as driversÂ’ skills and road conditions, but I can tell you the government is contemplating a ban on these visual entertainment devices as long as there exists a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slightest probability </span>of traffic disaster caused by it. Whether aggravating factors play a part, it is still an undisputable <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fact</span> that visual entertainment system distracts the driver, and is a potential cause of accident. Similar to speed of car, regardless of any aggravating factors, it is still an undisputable <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fact</span> that higher speed, higher impact and damage done. You really think the government is not aware of aggravating factors when enforcing new laws?? c'mon, each and everyone of us are aware of such factors and can brainstorm thousands of them if time allows.<br><br>Unless you are an avid regular speedsters, I donÂ’t think we should really oppose the implementation of speed limiter device. Of course we can believe that it wonÂ’t work, but no harm giving it a pilot trial. As far as possible, I will try not to resort to personal attacks and insults but I have long ago noticed that there is one particular person in this forum who donÂ’t see eye to eye with my view, with that, I can still tolerate and donÂ’t give a damn but what makes me pissed up is that this bugger keeps calling me a retard incessantly on many occasions and IÂ’m beginning to mark this fella. If i am not wrong, he is merely a damn pathetic chee bye kuku bird lan jiao sicko filthy lowly sore dumbass maniac who has kenna traffic accident before I hope the chicken farts into his big lame mouth and his penis drops into the toilet bowl.<br></div>
