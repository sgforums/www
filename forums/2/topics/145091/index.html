            <div class='col-md body'>The initial trial in Leeds was very successful and there are plans to extend it to London. They expect more than 1000 lives to be saved each year with this device.<br><br>It is possible to temporarily override the signal in an emergency (that is emergency on the road..nothing to do with your wife or pet dog needing to go to the hospital). However, the signal comes back on again if you try to speed...so it gets so frustrating speeding up and slowing down again that you accept it and drive below the speed limit.<br><br>LTA may worry about the loss in revenue from speeding tickets. But that is not a problem. Each time you exceed the speed limit, your details can be recorded electronically as a signal is sent to slow you down. It is more efficient than speed cameras and LTA will have a windfall in fines.<br><br>With this device, everyone will drive below the speed limit and your ferrari will never go any faster than my subaru.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"thats y now cars have to be designed to be pedestrian friendly....so if they walk into yr car they can simply dust themselves off and continue staggering themselves back home...  " &lt;--- from Top Gear's Peugeot Review?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>It is logical, of course, that driving at slower speeds can help to reduce the seriousness of accident injuries. But let us remember, that we drivers have the roads to use, and the main reason many of us have gotten ourselves have gotten personal transport is simply because it gets us quicker from A to B. Now, if that factor is removed from motorists, then there isn't much of a point to own a private vehicle is there? Followed by, there wouldn't be much of a right use of the roads, right? Pedestrians do have their responsibilities to cross carefully as well. My stand is that if you are too lazy to use the traffic light or overhead bridge, then don't cross the roads at the motorist's inconvenience. And I don't think that that is unreasonable at all.<br><br>If you guys have driven through Orchard on a weekend or through Serangoon Road, I'm sure you will understand what I mean when I say pedestrians have their responsibilities to cross safely as well. Some people know you are coming, but have that "aiyah he won't dare to bang me one lah" attitude. Well I probably won't, but I sure hope you will get knocked down, given your nonchalant attitude. If the pedestrian can't care less about their own safety, then it is unreasonable to say that the onus will then be entirely on the motorist to keep the jaywalker safe.<br><br>And still, Tomas: My question about de-limiting the top end speed has not been answered. Since you seem quite adamant about such an imposition, would you like to also share with us how that problem might be solved? Thanks.<br><br>Cheers!</div>

However, the signal comes back on again if you try to speed...so it gets so frustrating speeding up and slowing down again that you accept it and drive below the speed limit.<br><br>LTA may worry about the loss in revenue from speeding tickets. But that is not a problem. Each time you exceed the speed limit, your details can be recorded electronically as a signal is sent to slow you down. It is more efficient than speed cameras and LTA will have a windfall in fines.<br><br>With this device, everyone will drive below the speed limit and your ferrari will never go any faster than my subaru.</div></blockquote>Yes but that's leeds isn't it.
