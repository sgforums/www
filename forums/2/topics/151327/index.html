            <div class='col-md body'>test drove it once, when it was launch. the seat are supportive and the overall stock handling is more comfortable and better than my yrv-t. the down side is that the price is higher, compare to the other cars in its class.<br><br>there are alot of safty and warning features as well and think there are 4 airbags. can go for a test drive. power wise not bad a 1.3. and the gear and engine is smooth, and rather quiet within the cabin. the tacho on the dash is subjective, some like it and some dont. go for a drive to feel it yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Went down yesterday to try out the Sirion as some of you suggested. The basic (1.3, manual) is going for 53k. Found the car to be quite good for a small car. The fit and finish of the car is pretty good and it looks like it would be able to stand up to some abuse, at least better than the Hyundai or Picanto. That said, the dash is still plasticy, but at least it looks solid. The engine is perky, and doesn't mind being reved hard, which is good since you would have to rev it a fair bit to actually get up to speed quickly. But since few owners of a car like this is going to actually try racing a WRX or outrun the police, I guess it suits city driving well. The car is very manouverable and steering is light, making parking dead easy, which is much aided by its small size. Visibility is good, and storage spaces are all over the place.<br><br>Downsides are the gearshift, the soft suspension and the lack of an ashtray (trashbin). The gears seem a bit too tight and notchy, and requires a fair bit of effort to stick it in gear. The SE said that this will loosen up over time with use. I suppose there might be some truth in that..... The upshot is that the clutch is light. The soft suspension does provide a comfy ride over bumps, but try to get around a few corners too quickly and the soft suspension becomes way too obvious... but I must note that it's never enough to make you panicky. The high seating position aggravates body roll, I suppose. The lack of an ashtry is kinda odd (there is a ciggie lighter) but I suppose it will prevent pple like me from hoarding trash. Oh yeah, and the signal stalk is on the left, like the Euro cars. This may be a problem for some, but I think most will be able to adapt after inadvertantly seeing their wipers come on every time they turn.<br><br>Overall, I'd say its a good car on a budget against the Getz. But if you afford a more, the Suzie Swift would be a better driver's choice. You get what you pay for, i guess. Worth a look if you are looking for a small car.</div>

That itself will piss quite a number of car buyer off as what is considered new if some aspect is faulty and irreversible? I rather they take away that 2 meters.<br><br>That aside, the new swift has good handling. The drive is not bouncy (good suspension perhaps) and there is head rest for all 3 back passengers (not too bad at all!!). Beside that, the audio control on the steering wheel makes shuffling between music so much easier when driving.<br><br>All in all, its not a bad car.<br>funky exterior, good interior feel, adjustable seats, comfortable ride for both driver and passengers....just tt...i hate the faulty meters! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Do you know that there are getting more and more Kelisa after-market parts in Singapore.
