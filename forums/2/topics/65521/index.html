            <div class='col-md body'>German: Alway measure their power (BHP or torque) on the wheels. They always take the average of a number of production cars. Audi, BMW and Mercedes do this.<br><br>Jap: Measure on the fly. But the time the power is transfer to the wheels, there is loss of power of 10%~20%. Tend to take the best performance of the production car.<br><br>I am not baise against Jap. Anyone cares to comments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and in eurpoe they measure power by Torque while jap ppl measure it by BHP....thats y u see theat european cars are very torquey (esp. mercedes) while cars like honda are very revvy but have little torque</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Singapore, the low end torque is more important. Our roads have so many traffic lights. High end torque is great for over taking while cruising.<br><br>Anyway, you cannot have high torque and high bhp, you must sacrifice one of them unless you have huge displacement. That is why supercharge and turbo come in.<br><br>Have you guys try the new audi a4 1.8t? The mutitronic (aka CVT) gear box is a gem. It feels smooth and fast with very even accelation without even flooring it. Alas it is a front wheel drive.</div>
