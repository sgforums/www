              <p>ERP rates in CBD to go up, 5 new gantries added<br>By Asha Popatlal, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 17 June 2008 1925 hrs</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: About half of existing ERP gantries islandwide will see their rates increase from July 7.</p>
              <p>The electronic road pricing (ERP) rates for 32 of 65 gantries will increase by between 50 cents and S$2.00. The gantries are primarily in the Central Business District (CBD) and Orchard Road.</p>
              <p>Five new ERP gantries along the Singapore River will also be activated on July 7.</p>
              <p>Traffic in the CBD is slowing down, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA). So in January, as part of its Master Plan, the LTA came up with a new way to measure speed.</p>
              <p>It is called <em>the 85th percentile method - this is when motorists experience smooth traffic at least 85 percent of the time on roads that have ERP gantries</em>.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Another new LTA initiative is for bigger ERP rate increases because, LTA said, motorists are less sensitive to the existing rate structure. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p>In addition, ERP operating hours in the CBD will be extended by one hour on weekdays - from 7pm to 8pm - while gantries in the Orchard Road cordon will start an hour earlier on Saturdays, at 11am.</p>
              <p><strong>To reduce congestion further, LTA is putting in five new gantries along the Singapore River. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>This essentially divides the CBD into two parts - the predominantly shopping-commercial district around the Bugis-Marina area and the office-based areas in Robinson Road.</strong></p>
              <p>LTA hopes that these gantries, which run from Eu Tong Sen Street to Fullerton Road, will cut down on what they call "through traffic".</p>
              <p>LTA's chief engineer for transportation, Dr Chin Kian Keong, said: "The gantries along the Singapore River will deal with traffic passing through. They (some motorists using the roads) are not destined for that part of the city, but merely passing through to get to other parts of Singapore. If we can discourage some of these trips from city roads, traffic levels on these roads will become better."</p>
              <p><strong>Currently, a third of all traffic in the area is what LTA calls "through traffic" and LTA hopes to cut this by half, with the new ERP gantries. </strong></p>
              <p>Five of these gantries will operate from Mondays to Fridays from 6pm to 8pm daily. Two of them will also operate in the day on Saturdays.</p>
              <p>The gantries at Fullerton Road, Eu Tong Sen Street, New Bridge Road and South Bridge Road will operate on weekdays from 6pm to 8pm. Motorists will pay $2 from 6pm to 7.30pm and $1 from 7.30pm to 8pm.</p>
              <p>Gantries at Fullerton Road and Eu Tong Sen will also operate from 12.30pm to 8pm on Saturdays and motorists will have to pay $2.</p>
              <p><strong>More changes may be coming up. In November, LTA will again use its new criteria to review gantry rates within and up to the outer cordon. And in February next year, LTA will look at all other gantries islandwide.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The question many motorists may have is "why is the government increasing the ERP rates now?", considering that there is a freeze on all government fees till the end of the year. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Transport Ministry said things like the ERP rates are excluded from the freeze and that traffic congestion, left unchecked, will have a negative effect on the economy.</strong> - CNA/ir</p>

              <p>Are Singaporeans really that poor?</p>
              <p>When motor vehicle sales in April are 7.1% above one year ago. With cars and petrol and parking and ERP getting more expensive, POOR singaporeans are suppose to buy less cars but no, the complaints keep coming in but cars keep getting sold. Dun tell me that these are contributed by the luxury cars because for every luxury car i see on the road, i see at least 20 cheaper cars like the honda i am driving.</p>
              <p>How can Singaporeans be poor when I see the long queue outside at the cashier counters at some departmental stores like BHG and Robinsons? How can Singaporeans be poor when throngs of people went into Marks And Spencers over the weekends just because they ran a NO GST promotion. M and S are not cheap.</p>
              <p>How can Singaporeans be poor when the recently ended PC show raked in sales of $51.7 million almost doubling last year's sales of $26 million.</p>
              <p>How to really convinced people singaporeans are poor?</p>
              <p>There are POOR singaporeans but the least qualified people to say they are people are people who can afford to buy a car, buy a LCD TV, buy a good computer system, who can have a lunch or dinner at a restaurant, who can afford to buy new clothes at boutiques and departmental stores.</p>
              <p>Please, its your own desires and wants that are depriving yourself of more money. Dun dilute the meaning of POOR. There are really POOR people out there who deserves our help more than people who comes and shout "I am poor" when the ERP raises by 50 cents.</p>

              <p>i don't have car. neither do i have an lcd tv. i want to buy a good com sys, but can't afford. i have lunch and dinner at kopitiams. i don't always buy clothes.</p>
              <p>the 7.1% is because rich people are owning more cars. more cars per household. not the poors that are buying.</p>
              <p>well there are still people who spend their fortune on a car. in the end they don't have much left to spend on erp, petrol, all other other expenses.</p>
              <p>there are other groups who don't buy car, buy spend their fortune on branded items, queuing outside branded boutiques at taka and no money to pay GST, etc.</p>
              <p>there are also other groups who don't buy car, don't buy branded goods but spend their fortune on luxuries such as lcd tv. then they stay at home and enjoy because they have no money to spend elsewhere.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I always think if already spent so much on the car, why complain on the additional charges.  To pay the ERP charges is nothing, the problem is you pay and still get to enjoy the jam.  tha's the frastrating part.  I must agree that the government is being insensitive about this increase at this time when all thing is heading north.  They could have waited for thing to improve.  I supposed they want to show the world Singapore is different.  The government can raise fee anytime and are not afraid of repercussion as protest and strike are illegals here ...</p></div>

              <p>i don't have car. neither do i have an lcd tv. i want to buy a

              kopitiams. i don't always buy clothes.</p>
              <p>the 7.1% is because rich people are owning more cars. more cars

              <p>well there are still people who spend their fortune on a car. in
              the end they don't have much left to spend on erp, petrol, all
              other other expenses.</p>
              <p>there are other groups who don't buy car, buy spend their
              fortune on branded items, queuing outside branded boutiques at taka
              and no money to pay GST, etc.</p>
              <p>there are also other groups who don't buy car, don't buy branded
              goods but spend their fortune on luxuries such as lcd tv. then they
              stay at home and enjoy because they have no money to spend

              <p>I think you just made my point. Singaporeans are not poor. They just dun have enough money to spend and most of it are caused by their own extravagant spending. Some I see buy a condo when its more affordable to stay in HDB based on their income. Some choose a 2litre petrol guzzling car instead of a simple 1litre Kia Picanto. Some choose to buy a LCD TV when a CRT TV is cheaper and gives better quality. Some choose to eat at restaurants, expensive ones i mean, instead of getting better tasting food at better prices in the coffeeshops. Some choose to buy 4D or TOTO or SLEAGUE or whatever instead of saving the money.</p>
              <p>Yes, the prices of almost everything is rising. But ask ourselves honestly, could we have spend alot on things that we do not NEED? Could we have cut back on certain expenditure that is not NECESSARY? I know I have. That is why I do not complain.</p>
              <p>It is not wrong to indulge cos afterall we work so hard for our money. I indulge and I enjoyed it. BUT it is WRONG when people choose to indulge and yet complain that they are poor.</p>
