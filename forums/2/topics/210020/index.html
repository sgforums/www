            <div class='col-md body'>$3+ avg per day is not practical. we need to include 2 bus + 1 mrt per trip on avg. $2.50 per trip. $6 per day is more reasonable, averaging over weekends and nights out.<br><br>To own a basic car + all stuffs would require abt $1.5k a month. (dont forget  insurance and servicing and repair and fines!).<br><br>So even for a family of 5, public tpt is still abt half owning a car.<br><br>Tat's from the cost point of view. Quality of life is totally another story.<br><br>OPC are meant for a niche segment who in my opinion are not meant for tight income folks.<br><br>My conclusion is<br>1. public tpt is much lower then owning a car<br>2. if single, and job does not require it, is best take public tpt<br>3. for family, and can afford it, best own a car.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FERRARIman:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, I know This topics sometimes came out again and again and again.. but sumtimes people get curious.. with now all the transport fare raise ard singapore..<br><br>If you calculated your transport money lets say per day, U go to work with a max fare of $1.70 &amp; back to home also a fare of $1.70 (it cud be more ex).

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">After raising the bus fares time after time again, why is the government still saying that SBS is only earning marginal profits? I don't get the point... Long long time ago where bus fares were much lower, the buses continued to be in service wat.... now that the fares have gone up, and the buses also earn from the advertisements printed outside or inside the bus, what is the problem man?<br><br>Long time ago, commuters can cheat bus fares by paying the minimal amount either by coins or farecard... but now EZ link card cannot cheat wat... that means SBS is earning more compared to the past....<br><br>With so many reasons given above, why are the fares still rising? Why is SBS still not earning enough? Sometimes i really get fed up with buses that go super slow or with air con spoiled (if it's crowded, it's worse than being in a non-aircon bus) etc etc etc... Lots of service problems! and i'm sure most of you understand what i mean... sometimes taking the public transport can be a real torture, even if we pay much more compared to the past... WHY IS THIS SO?</span></div>
