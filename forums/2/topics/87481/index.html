            <div class='col-md body'>Backfire is either deliberate or not. I have come across cars that installed flame thrower to emulate extreme backfire. That is cool but dangrous. Can use it for bbq at times.<br><br>Here's my share of explanation. Its not about clearing carbon or oil!<br><br>What causes Backfiring really?<br><br>More often than not, backfire occurs when a driver downshifts and throttle. This is caused by a lean condition. What happens is that the air fuel mixture leans out enough to where is fails to ignite consistently. This, in turn allows some un-burnt fuel to get into the exhaust pipes. Then when the engine does fire, these unburnt gases are ignited in the exhaust pipe, causing the backfire.<br><br>As for Rotary Engines, here's the link for the most detailed explanation.<br><br><a href="http://travel.howstuffworks.com/rotary-engine2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://travel.howstuffworks.com/rotary-engine2.htm</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eyewitness:</div><div class="quote_body">hi...car Enthusiastic......i was watching INITIAL-D and there was this part where Takumi race with a EVO 3.i wan to ask if anyone knows wat is the main function for hte evo's backfire. i have seen this in rallys b4.but wat is the main purpose and also does anywan know wat are the advantage of using rotary engine used in mazda rx-7???thanks.....</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>backfire systems installed in a car like the WRC cars are meant to act as a turbo anti-lag system. basically what it does is to create a combustion at the exhaust, which draws air along the exhaust pipe, in order to prevent a backflow of air which would slow down the turbo n cause turbo lag as it takes time to spool up again.</div>

The ALS does not "throw" or pump out excess carbon or oil from the engine. Its a deliberate solution installed in turbo-charged race cars to prevent turbo-lag and keep the turbo spinning. If you have sat in a stock turbo-charged car, you will notice a significant surge after the engines have reached a certain rpm. Before reaching that rpm, the turbo is not generating enough boost...<br><br>The ALS "wakes up" the turbo by igniting the air fuel mixture even tho the car is off-throttle. This will keep the turbine spinning and hence when the driver applies gas, its takes less time for the turbo to generate boost (in other words, reduce lag time).<br><br>To answer your qn bmw_lover (you really mean "to prevent turbo lag" not anti-lag) keeping your right foot down whilst accelerating around a corner is not always a good idea, anyone will tell you that. What you can do is "left foot braking", which is to accelerate(with your right foot) and brake (with your left foot unless you have more than 2 feet) at the same time. The accelerating will keep the turbo spinning whilst the braking... well, you know what it does. Try this at your own expense (meaning leave guardrails and other humans out of your madness), btw it might boil your brake fluids too... but if you are nuts enough to do it then... you have bigger probs than just boiling brake fluids.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Left foot braking?

            <div class='col-md body'>S110 SILVIA AND 180SX<br><br>Enter the 180SX! The S110's entrance in 1979 saw the first release of the 180SX otherwise known as the hatchback version of the Silvia. Following suite with the fairlady's, the 180sx was named after the capacity of the engine (1.8L).<br><br>The S110 was powered by several engines - one was a 1952cc 4 cylinder producing 89kW as well as a 1770cc (presumably for the 180SX?) 4 cylinder engine yielding 68kW at 5800rpm and 139Nm at 3600rpm. Nissan also apparently experimented briefly with a rotary engine (supposively something similar in design to the Mazda 10A rotary) in the S110, but it was short lived as most Silvia's continued to be fitted with the conventional 1770cc engine.<br><img src="&lt;br%20/&gt;http://members.iinet.net/~sayers/biscuits/ss110.jpg"></div>
