By the way, what's your objective of driving without stopping? What if you were tired? It would be dangerous. What's your ride anyway?<br><br>If you are talking about old cars, maybe more than 10 years, and you hardly service it then chances are you will have problems driving long distance. Even less than 10 years and if you hardly maintain it, you will still face problems.<br><br>Drive to KL lah, quite shiok! Test it out and let us know. Be safe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>previously, i always accompany my friend to KL trips, it's really tiring for a driver to drive all the way. Best is to have 1 or 2 "pit-stop". &amp; with a 1 or 2 more person in the car, makes some difference, at least there's conversation and the mind would drift away so easily.<br><br>Driving at night is more dangerous but it's more comfortable.<br><br>Either way, just be careful on the Highway, as i have seen the lorry drivers changing lane ... eeks !<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>If i drive up to KL, I would normally made at least 1 stop.  At Air Keroh R&amp;R.  My average stop distance will be at every 200 km.  Just nice long distance.  Upon reaching KL, parked car at hotel than go shopping n whatever using their MRT.  Safer and faster this way.  As u know, KL is notorious for traffic jam.<br><br>However, if I drive further north to Penang, I would also stop at Air Keruh,  then drive up by passing KL and using the Cyberjaya Highway upto Rawang n stop.  Then I would carry on until I reached Tapah.  Real rest over there. For this type of trip, I would normally leave Spore around 7 p.m.  Reach Tapah around 3 a.m.  Sleep in the car.  Wake up in morning, then carry on with my journey until reached Penang around 10 a.m. or so.<br><br>Yup, I agree, driving in the nite is much cooler and more comfortable.  One thing very very important to take note, don't act ya ya over there!  My wife doesnt have a DL, so I drove solo.<br><br>Upon reaching Penang bridge, take precautionary measures and drive defensively.  Two lanes and I felt that it quite narrow.

On my several trips up there, I only saw twice Spore Registered Car.<br><br>For those who are new to Malaysia Highway and especially those who have light right leg, open your eyes big big, see any oncoming vehicles on the other side of the road.  If u see 2 3 cars flashed their headlight, better slow down until u stop at the police road block.  The police road block maybe as far as 8 km away.  So, if u happen to see road block on the other side of the road, do flash your headlights to warn others on the other side of the road.<br><br>Try it, it will be fun.

Do a very proper inspection first before you make your trip.<br><br>I used to do a lot of long distance driving, that mean I be having a 1 or 2 week driving hoilday which I would start driving about 7.00a.m till 8.00p.m everyday covering 1000 - 1500 km each day.<br><br>The thumb of the rule is to stop the car for at least 10 mins, and get some rest, every 2 hr !  because if you force it on, you are likely to get into trouble before you know it.<br><br>A lot of factors will affect your driving, your car, the road, traffic and your driving experience .<br><br>However it is good to carrry a few bottles of red bulls, which drinking a can or 2 when you need to push on will really help you stay awake.<br><br>My advice for your KL trip is to stop 1/2 way. KL is not too far but you are still new to your car, that will indirectly tired you out faster. Also yours is a new car, would advice you not to push it all the way. Just stop 1/2 for 10mins to freshen up also do a quick inspection on your new car to see how it is coping with the trip.<br></div>
