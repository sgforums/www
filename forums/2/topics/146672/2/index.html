Its becos i despise guys who are violent against gals... Well, of cos if i purposely do all these to him, with his kinda character, he will definitely wanna attack me... Of cos, then i will strike as taekwondo black belter... i wont strike unless he attack me 1st... i wont wack him jialat jialat, but i will use my tkd unarmed combat skills to lock his elbow and pin him to the floor, well its quite a simple tkd technique even if applies to bigger sized guy than myself...

            <div class='col-md body'>Personal opinion.<br><br>Both parties are at faults and both parties do not know what is the best course of actions.<br><br>1) Your gf shouldn't be parking there turning the hazard lights on. It's a two lane traffic and most of the time the speed is pretty fast there. She is endangering herself and the others. If her car spoils.. no choice. Then people will also understand.<br><br>Given most of the irresponsible and inconsiderate drivers nowadays causing accidents.. If you are the one who try to avoid her and get into an accident or nearly kenna an accident, how would you feel?<br><br>Turn to that, is that driver being righteous by "lecturing" her. If not moments later it could be your gf or other road users landing in hospitals. Your gf should call police immediately and try not getting into any conversation with that agressive driver.<br><br>2) The person shouldn't take it out on her by scolding vulgarities. This is wrong. Even if it is not a traffic issues, given that should be serve a "outrage of modesty"  to that guy. If he is reading all this.. Hope he next time could privately make a call to police informing of such act potentially causing road hazards to other road users.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel it is my duty to inform all motorists that concealing weapons in a vehicle is a criminal offence. Threatening behaviour and use of abusive language and physical acts of violence constitutes road rage and is punishable with a jail term. All road bullys will be arrested immediately and given a deterrent sentence under section 323 of the Penal Code Cap. 224.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Axl Rose,<br><br>Just some friendly advice. You really should not include any information with regards to the aggressor's license plate number in your post. He would reserve the right for defamation in this case. You can narrate the incident, but putting personal information such as a car plate number which could eventually lead to possible damages doesnt put you in a favorable light in the eyes of the law.<br><br>You may ask now: "How would he know its me? I can deny it."<br><br>1) Your IP address of the computer you are using is traceable. In the event of a criminal breach, I believe such information can be requested from the relevant authorities who are guardians to this forum, which would be the moderators.<br><br>2) Considering a police report was made, personal information would have been given to the authorities. Tracing the culprit down is something I do not have to spell further.<br><br>In the event which you have described, my heart goes out to your girlfriend, regardless of whether she did make an initial error of obstructing traffic. Her mistake does not warrant such a strong and offensive behavior from the aggressor. However, it does not pay for you to put yourself in such a position of disadvantage. Remote as it may sound, in the event that any damages are done to the aggressor which could be linked to your posting, I believe you may be held liable.<br><br>I hope all is well with your girlfriend. Drive safe!<br><br>Cheers!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Axl Rose:</div><div class="quote_body">To all bros out there,<br><br>Below is a real life story which happen to my gf yesterday afternoon along linden drive(off bukit timah).<br><br>Her first time there to pick a friend, as she  was not familiar to the area, she stop on side of road to call her friend. Though she forgotten to switch on her hazard light, a car pass by and horn her, so she switch on the hazard light and the car just pass by.( for info, it was two way with single lane each). Suddenly the black Honda Fit stopped behind her and horn at her, with her hazard light on, he could just pas her which the previous car did. Instead he came down from his Fit and scolded my gf (there was another girl in my gf car) for parking on road side using the phone . He tried to open my gf car door which was locked so my gf wind down the window asked him whats the issue. He started scolding vugarlarities at her (what a guy). Feeling afraid, my girl quickly wind up the window and drove off.<br>At the junction of Kheam Hock road, the Fit was behind another car which in turn was behind my gf, then the Fit suddenly cut in between the second car and then squeeze to my gf left side (both car side mirror hit against each other) due to the narrow lane. Then he again alighted from his car and walk to the my gf car.<br>My gf again wind down the window and ask him whats the problem and he started scolded her for the earlier incident and say he will report to police (what right does he have and moreover he is the aggressor).<br>Guess what both of them met at the same Bukit Timah police post but he was there first cos my girl went to pick her friend first. And the guy started scolding her again at the station.<br><br>What I wanted to point out is that if you(the Fit driver) are one of the members here or your friend or relatives happens to be the guy(in his 40s and claim to be a business man), ask him to behave like a man, donÂ’t bully a girl.<br>Also, to all guys out there pls relate this to your girl and ask them to take care against such a coward.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
