            <div class='col-md body'>To all bros out there,<br><br>Below is a real life story which happen to my gf yesterday afternoon along linden drive(off bukit timah).<br><br>Her first time there to pick a friend, as she  was not familiar to the area, she stop on side of road to call her friend. Though she forgotten to switch on her hazard light, a car pass by and horn her, so she switch on the hazard light and the car just pass by.( for info, it was two way with single lane each). Suddenly the black Honda Fit stopped behind her and horn at her, with her hazard light on, he could just pas her which the previous car did. Instead he came down from his Fit and scolded my gf (there was another girl in my gf car) for parking on road side using the phone . He tried to open my gf car door which was locked so my gf wind down the window asked him whats the issue. He started scolding vugarlarities at her (what a guy). Feeling afraid, my girl quickly wind up the window and drove off.<br>At the junction of Kheam Hock road, the Fit was behind another car which in turn was behind my gf, then the Fit suddenly cut in between the second car and then squeeze to my gf left side (both car side mirror hit against each other) due to the narrow lane. Then he again alighted from his car and walk to the my gf car.<br>My gf again wind down the window and ask him whats the problem and he started scolded her for the earlier incident and say he will report to police (what right does he have and moreover he is the aggressor).<br>Guess what both of them met at the same Bukit Timah police post but he was there first cos my girl went to pick her friend first. And the guy started scolding her again at the station.<br><br>What I wanted to point out is that if you(the Fit driver) are one of the members here or your friend or relatives happens to be the guy(in his 40s and claim to be a business man), ask him to behave like a man, donÂ’t bully a girl.<br>Also, to all guys out there pls relate this to your girl and ask them to take care against such a coward.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. that is really nasty of that driver. IMHO, horning your gf is sufficient to justify his displeasure for her blocking the lane. However, taking things(scolding vulgarities and chasing her) to such an extent was rather uncalled for.</div>
