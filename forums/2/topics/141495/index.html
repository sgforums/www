            <div class='col-md body'>You should get your family to chip in if this is to be a family car. I read about the cost of OPC somewhere. It would be about 8k per year, with well-spread-out 10 years loan for a small car. That includes everything including estimated ERP usage and mis carpark expenses.<br><br>A guide for normal small/budget car would be about 11k-12k per year, depending on usage.</div>

The different will be quite significant if the latter doesn't claim any insurance on his pervious rides and still got back to his original insurance agent/company when getting his new car. Reason is because of the NCD, no claim discount. Should be any differences otherwise.</div>
