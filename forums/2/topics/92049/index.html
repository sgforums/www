            <div class='col-md body'>No offence to Lorry driver/big vehicles but YES they are very skillful but  they are usually the culprits who causes dents to our cars &amp; also Scratches. Personally witness and experience a few. Nearle got into a fight with one who open his door like nobody Biz and "bang" xxxxxxx 1 hole on my car left side.<br><br>Also saw once a lorry reverse so fast and hard like he thinks he's some f1 racer and "bang". Kena the front side of a MERC. Deep dent &amp; long Scratches appeared. Dunno how much the lorry driver got to compensate though.<br><br>Juz some advice. Ps value peoples cars. Causing Dents to other's vehicle due to simply "bo Chap" is very annoying to the receivers especially those who really takes good care of their rides. No offence to anyone. These is for all drivers inregardless of what you're drivin.<br><br>Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
