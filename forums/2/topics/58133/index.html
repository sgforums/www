Thanx!</div></blockquote>I don't know much about the GTO but when I was in college I had a Dodge Stealth RT Turbo for a while and the dealer told me it was the same as the GTO. It was a pretty fun car. I can't say anything about the handling because I've never personally tried taking it through an obstacle course though. So maybe it's not such a performer compared to the rest of what you listed, but it sure looks good. It's a true blue sports coupe not a sedan...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I owned a GTO (Mitsu 3000GT VR4) in the US for about 3 years... with an AWD launch, few cars are faster stoplight-to stoplight, but the car is weaker on the top end due to the 20% drivetrain loss that AWD cars suffer.  Also, it's not a car you want to throw around in the twisties because it understeers badly and it IS a heavy car... After modes, the best time I ran at the track was a 12.97@106MPH, not bad for a 9 year old car, I guess....  Pics are here<br><br>http://www.imagestation.com/album/?id=4291866359</div>

Abt the GTO - its a heavily modded killing machine. i saw  i saw the NOSed Maclaren clip before. hehe madness... going almost 450km/h right? Camaro also powerful...american muscle. I also saw a 1000bhp Diablo...doing 100m in 5secs. hehe madness....<br><br>I got another true story.... a friend of mine is running a 2.0boost in his wrx.... but he cannot outrun a malaysian registered Accord on KJE. Funny thing is... we heard external wastegate from it. tc-charged i guess... we are going at 185km/h... still cannot hahahaha....</div>
