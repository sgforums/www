Thinkin of getting ur 1st Car  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> . Here are some of the question(s) you might want to 'think carefully' before getting one -<br>(1) Do you really <strong>"need"</strong> a car ? Is it a <strong>'must' </strong>or you see ppl <strong>'buy' </strong>you also want to 'buy'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>(2) Do you have lot$ of money$ for ... - Monthly installment, carpark, fuel, erp<br>...maintenance...other unforseen circumstances<br><br>Just these 2 questions will do lah - If u have lot$ of money then I gue$$ u don have to read my reply. Just a suggestion, why don u rent -a- car for a month and then you will <strong>feel how is to own a car</strong>.<br><br>cheers,<br>Sham</div>
