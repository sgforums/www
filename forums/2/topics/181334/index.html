            <div class='col-md body'>You see, I drive a 10 years old Nissan March. I was tailgated everyday even though I kept within the speed limit. I hate to travel highway because when I drive at the leftmost lane, I was tailgated by lorries and vans. Am I road hog when I drive 70 km/h at the leftmost lane of the highway? The best part is when I need to make a right turn in an up-slope multi-lanes road, some cars will tailgate me and others will cut infront of my car. I feel like a criminal been squashed in between unmarked police cars. Sometime I feel guilty driving on the road because I see everybody rushing for something while I take my own sweet time.<br><br>You see, I am not rich and I cannot afford new and powerful cars. But I need a car to make a decent living. So please, when you saw a poor little old Nissan March driving on the road, please give her a break. She just want to travel safely from point A to point B.<br><br>BTW, is tailgate a traffic offence?<br><br>Xie xie!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

But travelling on the leftmost lane should be alright. Those lorries and vans might seems to be tailing you, but that is because their car no nose, so they seems closer than other cars.<br><br>Anyway, when people tail you, just make sure you keep a reasonable safety distance in front, so if anything happen, the impact from the back wouldn't make you ram the car in front.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Tailgating, don't know leh, so far never heard anyone kanna summon for that before.

This is why a lot of vans and light trucks end up in the center lane overtaking (leap-frogging).<br><br>40 is for large trailer trucks, 50 is mostly for army vehicles and some large commercial trucks, and 60/70 largely vans, pickups, and mini-buses.<br><br>You see, many times when there are a few army trucks or vehicles in front on the left lane, there'll be a long Q behind, and those with the 60, and 70 sticker will start to overtake the army vehicles in front.  And then there are those who travel at 60 because their limit is 60, those with 70 sticker will overtake the 60 limit vehicles.<br><br>So, this is all LTA's fault. No fix standards, too many different speed limits.<br><br></div>

I was tailgated everyday even though I kept within the speed limit. I hate to travel highway because when I drive at the leftmost lane, I was tailgated by lorries and vans. Am I road hog when I drive 70 km/h at the leftmost lane of the highway? The best part is when I need to make a right turn in an up-slope multi-lanes road, some cars will tailgate me and others will cut infront of my car. I feel like a criminal been squashed in between unmarked police cars. Sometime I feel guilty driving on the road because I see everybody rushing for something while I take my own sweet time.<br><br>You see, I am not rich and I cannot afford new and powerful cars. But I need a car to make a decent living. So please, when you saw a poor little old Nissan March driving on the road, please give her a break.

ITs a very broad definition of those 2 terms, but as long as you drive safely and keep a safe distance then you shouldn't worry about other jerks on the roads.</div>
