Desiel are design for low rpm with high torque to enable them to pull load from standstill easily at 1200rpm they can have easily 500Nm somemore with the high torque plus the TC = Mini evo liao.<br><br></div>

EK4 is history 1.6 with 160bhp onli more then 5yr car got. anything newer got 120 other then those performance type with cost preminum onli old cars to look at already.<br><br>140km/h for van is nothing. pple always have the concept of desiel is lousy, dirty, slow, powerless.<br><br>technology have advance for desiel so much nowdays dont even need to warm up the glow stick inisde just start and move off can liao. dont even need to wait car sometime still need to wait a little.<br><br>due to the nature of desiel which require high compression like 20:1 that why desiel are not as quiet as petrol cars.</div>

We trying 0-100.<br><br>If you say 140 on par with van, try drop to 4th gear and drag some more.<br><br>A 1.6L car even japanese car can go to 180.
