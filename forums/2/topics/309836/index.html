              <p><br>routes along ya foundation there can already, but what i more concern is about....waiting time for TP test, and practical lessons...say if u just finish ya lesson today, usually is there anymore slots for next day something like that...is that the case in CDC? my corncern is being able to do few lesson over few days as such....oh yeah i heard that there's express course for people who has previous driving experience eg. being a student in other centres before joining CDC...is the all above mentioned true in CDC?</p>

But i think u have to book EARLY. dont think like next day got slot then can book. must be duno how many days in advance:x regarding express cse, i think there is such a thing. u might want to check wif ur frens. and the testers are esp bo chap towards those wif driving exp, like those in army, or those wif bike license. few of my frens who have experience, during their tests, the instructor jus let them do their own thing and simply passed them:) hope this helps!</p></div>
