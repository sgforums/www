            <div class='col-md body'>From all your postings so far, there's one thing I gather.   I may be wrong, but I stongly believe that you're one of those high and mighty drivers that would always criticize all other drivers but won't look at your own bad habits.<br><br>I see drivers like this on the roads everyday roadhogging, refusing to yield the over taking lane to faster vehicles and then KPKB when someone tailgates or rashly overtakes on the left putting themselves, yourself and other road users at risk.  I've told off more than one taxi driver for this before.<br><br>I have to say this is one of the most dangerous driving habits there is... even more so than road hogging, speeding, tailgating, etc.   I'm refering to the "I can do no wrong and everyone else has to use the roads the way I see fit!" attitude.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ever notice people who compain a lot about tailgaters NEVER mention road hoggers?<br><br>I wonder if they know that a car can travel on other lanes besides the overtaking lane?  That if they get off the overtaking lane instead of hogging it, 99.5% of all tailgating experiences they faced would not have occured.   (I put 0.5% aside for the morons who will tailgate even on left most lanes, instead of just overtaking on the right)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
