            <div class='col-md body'>actually, wait. you're so stupid that even looking up the meaning of back stabbing on a dictionary won't work for u. how about i spell it out loud and clear for you.<br><br>Backstabbing is when somebody is friendly in front of you and does nasty things behind YOUR back. assuming it IS indeed me, u do notice i have particularly been nasty to those 2 morons in their faces, and so if i DID complain in vagsg, its not back stabbing, it's called giving Fuckers what they deserve.<br><br>On the other hand, if it IS backstabbing, that means whoever it is never did mention here that he is unhappy with the 2 Fuckwits, and even cordial to them. In that case, that wouldn't be ME anymore would it, since I HAVE been openly hostile to those 2 Asswipes. Yup. so either way, YOU LOSE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>by the way, u probably think it's a backstab because u're probably one of the Fuckwits and u feel horrified that your misdeeds are exposed to your fellow VW drivers? well too bad for u. next time learn that in the world of internet, just because u're anonymous doesn't mean u can safely be a Dickhead because there ARE people who WILL make sure u get your just deserts. Now piss off.</div>
