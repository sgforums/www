Unless you are telling me that that car will never be driven.<br><br>The TP on road will not allow such lamps to be used if he finds out even if it is for decorative purpose because it is only a switch away from being illegal. Why is it illegal, imho probably because it will cause confusion to other drivers with foreign lights emitted. Distraction to the drivers' attention.<br><br>Good analogy will be getting on the highway with an almost empty tank. It doesn't harm anyone if u make it to the station, but if it runs out of fuel while on highway( i.e turning on the decorative lamp), you are breaking the law. Pre-emptive motives.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Tommy<br><br></div>
