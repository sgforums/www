            <div class='col-md body'>those engines are designed for a diff purpose la....truck engines are never designed for speed in the 1st palce....more for heavy loads (thats where diesel comes in) even it has say 450 BHP for eg its also there for heavy loads and not for pure performance like in cars...and of czo they are never light...I think if u ever try 2 fit one in a car the front would prob buckle at the weight.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I think only motor bikes got this can of weight.<br>Also, did anyone read last saturday life section (or is it the one before last week) on motorbike Trump.
