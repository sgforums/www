              <p>Ask our gahmen got subsidize or not???? Our gahmen only see 'Subsidies' as a DIRTY WORD!!!! Bus no subsidies, let fake private companies make money and squeeze us dry. Taxi no subsidise and let companies song song up rental and slowly murder taxi drivers like carbon monoxide.</p>
              <p>Our gahmen let us die; M'sia gahmen let us die. Then we die lor. When we die, we also pull our gahmen along. Then our neighbour also affected cos no one shops there cos they ban petrol, sugar, and rice. Sing KTV also will not fill stomach....chum ah....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What good things will most probably turn out?? Mas Selamat will kuai kuai and volunter to return to Whitney cos costs of living is too high outside, he can run forever, swim to indonesia is too far and got earthquake! Inside Whitney still go free 3 meals a day, clothes to wear and free laundry service, private body Gurkhas body guards, cute officers to TCSS with, got private room no need to share with others; maybe still can continue to watch new season of Prison Break...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>They also come out with ideas that will shoot themselves in the foot. I remembered last year when they want to implement the RM$20 per entry at the checkpoint for foreign cars. The meters and holes were all drilled outside the customs booths..suddenly, everything went quiet and the porject sort of vaporized away. Most likely, no mud department wants to take the responsibility to collect the RM$20 toll fees.</p>

              <p>This stupid ban will just fizzle out from their track record. Their Iskandar Project is big enough for them to use their brains for a change.</p>

              <p>The Arabs are currently the biggest spender there, all those Posh Condos  in Bukit Bintang, KL, starting from RM4mil are100% sold and majority of them are from Arabs buying 2 or 3 units as their holiday chalet.</p>

                      has put off plans to ban foreign-registered vehicles from filling up on
                      subsidised petrol in its border areas with Singapore and Thailand,
                      Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak said yesterday.
              <p>The ban was originally to start today for Thai-registered vehicles
                      in the north and on June 9 for drivers of Singapore-registered cars in
                      the south.</p>
              <p>But Datuk Seri Najib, who is in Singapore to attend a security
                      summit, told reporters that an anti-inflation Cabinet committee would
                      meet tomorrow to review the plan.</p>
              <p>'We have to find a new effective date because there are other
                      matters, like for example, can we have separate pumps because the
                      Singaporeans are saying that they don't mind paying the market rate,'
                      he said.</p>
              <p>His comments indicated that the government may allow
                      foreigners to buy higher-priced fuel, whereas the earlier plan was to
                      impose a total ban on foreigners buying fuel.</p>
              <p>He said that the postponement was made following requests by Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Many Malaysians who work in Singapore have also complained that
                      they should be allowed to enjoy subsidised rates for their
                      Singapore-registered vehicles, he added.</p>
              <p>The move is part of Malaysia's measures to curb soaring
                      subsidies, which are expected to cost the government RM45 billion (S$19
                      billion) this year as global oil prices skyrocket.</p>
              <p>It bars foreign-registered vehicles from refuelling at petrol
                      stations within 50km of the country's borders with Singapore and
                      Thailand. The penalty for station owners who flout the rule is a fine
                      of up to RM250,000 or a jail term of three years.</p>
              <p>Separately, the Malaysian High Commissioner to Singapore,
                      speaking to The Straits Times yesterday, said that the Malaysian
                      government is conscious of the 'practical issues' that have arisen from
                      the proposed ban.</p>
              <p>There are many Malaysians who own Singapore vehicles,
                      including some who live in Johor Baru but travel daily to work here,
                      Datuk N. Parameswaran said.</p>
              <p>They should not be 'penalised'.</p>
              <p>'Being Malaysian, they should be able to enjoy a Malaysian facility extended to Malaysians,' he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Parameswaran said that government officials meeting tomorrow
                      will discuss suggestions that Malaysians who own Singapore-registered
                      vehicles be allowed to buy petrol by flashing their identity card, the
                      MyKad.</p>
              <p>'That's a very practical possibility,' he added.</p>
              <p>It had been reported that some Malaysians who own Singapore-registered vehicles were upset by the ban.</p>
              <p>But others, like Ms Jenny Leong, thought it was fair.</p>
              <p>'I work in Singapore and live here, so I shouldn't get to enjoy
                      the subsidy,' said the 60-year-old financial consultant, who is a
                      permanent resident here.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Malaysia's gasoline stations suffer slowdown near Thai border as foreign sales ban starts</h1>
              <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia - Malaysia started enforcing a ban on gasoline
              sales to foreign-registered vehicles near the Thai border Monday,
              causing some stations' business to trickle nearly to a halt.</p>
              <p>Government officers were deployed at stations in northern states to
              monitor the ban, which is meant to help tackle the problem of soaring
              subsidies that keep Malaysia's retail prices at nearly half of those in
              Thailand.</p>
              <p>Thousands of Thais and Singaporeans drive into Malaysia
              every day to fill their tanks and take advantage of lower prices due to
              the subsidies, which were expected to cost the government 45 billion
              ringgit (US$14 billion; ï¿½9 billion) this year.</p>
              <p>Abdul Wahid Bidin,
              acting president of the Petroleum Dealers Association of Malaysia, said
              90 percent of the usual customers of some fuel stations near the border
              were from Thailand.</p>
              <p>"There are complaints from the dealers that
              they've got no business, no customers at all," Abdul Wahid said,
              expressing hope the ban will be lifted soon.</p>
              <p>Government
              authorities have indicated the ban will be a temporary measure until
              they revise the current subsidy system to help low-income Malaysians
              and to prevent waste or abuse of the system.</p>
              <p>Deputy Prime
              Minister Najib Razak said Sunday that the ban would be postponed for
              300 stations within 30 miles (50 kilometers) of Malaysia's borders with
              Thailand and Singapore, but local media clarified Monday that the delay
              was only for the southern state of Johor near Singapore.</p>
              <p>Regular
              gasoline in Malaysia costs 1.92 ringgit (US$0.61; ï¿½0.40) a liter, or
              7.27 ringgit (US$2.34; ï¿½1.52) a gallon. Thailand sells regular gasoline
              at 31.59 baht ($1.01; ï¿½0.73) a liter, or 120 baht (US$3.87; ï¿½2.51) per
              gallon.</p>
              <p>Alang Zari Ishak, president of oil company Esso
              Malaysia's dealers association, said the ban affected about 100
              gasoline stations in the north near Thailand.</p>
              <p>"The implications
              will be quite severe," he said, adding that a system in which
              foreigners pay higher prices _ instead of being completely barred from
              buying fuel _ would be better.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Singaporeans likely to cut down on trips to Malaysia once petrol sale ban starts</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Some Singaporeans said they may cut back on trips to
              Malaysia once the proposed ban on the sale of petrol and diesel to
              foreign registered vehicles within a 50—kilometre radius of Malaysia’s
              borders takes effect.</p>
              <p>The ban is expected to kick in as early as this Friday in a move to prevent abuse of heavy fuel subsidies.</p>
              <p>However,
              Malaysia’s Domestic Trade Minister, Shahrir Samad, said on Tuesday that
              the ban is a temporary one. It will be lifted once a new subsidy
              mechanism to replace the existing scheme, where everyone is subsidised,
              is put in place.</p>
              <p>Still, the move is expected to affect hundreds of motorists who regularly cross over the border for cheaper oil.</p>
              <p>Malaysia’s diesel and petrol prices are among the lowest in Asia due to high government subsidies.</p>
              <p>The
              ban is expected to affect up to 300 petrol stations in the country. And
              Singaporeans who head to Johor Bahru for cheaper petrol will be the
              most affected.</p>
              <p>For example, Loy Cheong, a businessman who is a regular traveller across the border, said he will cut back on his trips.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Cheong, Business Development Manager, Medo Enterprises Holding, said:
              "Buying cheap petrol is one of the privileges and what attracts the
              Singaporean to go there. But with this implementation, it may deter
              people from visiting Johor.</p>
              <p>"We go normally once a week or once
              in every two weeks. But if they implement this, maybe we will go less
              often, like once a month."</p>
              <p>Also facing problems are Malaysians who are Singapore permanent residents.</p>
              <p>Koh
              Ming Li, a Singapore permanent resident, lives near the border and has
              been coming to Singapore almost every day for the past two years for
              work.</p>
              <p>He said: "The problem now is that it prohibits me from
              driving directly into JB. And as for the 50—kilometre radius from JB, I
              would say (there’s) almost no petrol kiosks within JB that I can pump
              petrol from."</p>
              <p>Petrol kiosk operators who violate the ban face the
              possibility of a S$110,000 fine (RM$250,000) or a three—year jail term
              or both. — CNA/vm</p>
