              <p>hey guys i got a question, now i'm learning how to drive an auto car. but for some reason i strongly regretted that i never choose class 3 (manual) in the first place.</p>
              <p>So i was thinking once i obtain my class 3a license, is there such thing as a class 3a to class 3 conversion course.</p>
              <p>I really want to know...</p>

For enquiries, please call (<span>AAS</span>) at <span>tel</span> no: 6737 2444.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Where can I obtain a Class 4 and Class 5 Driving <span>Licence</span>?</span></strong><br> You may call the <span>Jurong</span> Test Centre at 6261 3236.</p>

              <p><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span class="sub_title">Automatic Transmission Vehicle (ATV) Test</span></strong></span><br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Will the theory tests for Class 3 and Class <span>3A</span> be different?</span></strong><br> The Basic and Final Theory Tests are the same for both ATV and MTV learners.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Can I drive an ATV if I have a Class 3 <span>licence</span>?</span></strong><br> Yes. A Class 3 <span>licence</span> will allow you to drive both <span>MTVs</span> and ATVs legally.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Can I drive a MTV with a Class <span>3A</span> <span>licence</span>?</span></strong><br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">No. You will need to undergo a practical test in an MTV to ensure that 
              you are able to handle an MTV and drive on the road on an MTV. The fee 
              for the practical test is $20.</span><br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Can I apply for a taxi-driver's job or other jobs requiring vocational <span>licences</span> with my Class <span>3A</span> <span>licence</span>?</span></strong><br> No. You have to follow the regulations as stipulated by <span>LTA</span> when applying for vocational <span>licences</span>. They require a Class 3 <span>licence</span>.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">I have a Class <span>3A</span> <span>licence</span>. How do I get a Class 3 driving <span>licence</span>?</span></strong><br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">You need to apply for the Class 3 practical test, which is essentially a driving test using an MTV.</span><br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">What documents must I bring along for my practical test? </span></strong><br> You will have to produce your identity card or passport, test fee 
              receipt and the car insurance certificate [for student of Private 
              Driving Instructors (<span>PDIs</span>)].<br> <strong><br></strong> <strong><span class="faq_title">What is the advantage of going through the ATV-only training lessons? </span></strong><br> It is for those who are certain that they would only be driving ATVs after acquiring a driving <span>licence</span>, as more time would be spent on training you on the features peculiar to ATVs.<br> <strong><br><span class="faq_title">Are there any countries that have implemented this scheme successfully? </span></strong> <br> Yes. Countries like the US, UK, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Korea, and Australia have implemented similar schemes.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">I have a Class <span>3A</span> <span>licence</span>. How long must I wait before I can apply and take a Class 3 practical test? </span></strong><br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">You can apply for a Class 3 practical test as soon as you have obtained your Class <span>3A</span> <span>licence</span>.</span><br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">If I have a Class <span>3A</span> <span>licence</span>, can I drive cars that are using <span>clutchless</span> manual transmissions <span>e.g</span>. Alfa Romeo's <span>selespeed</span>, <span>Opel's</span> <span>easytronic</span> etc? </span></strong><br> Yes. As long as there is no need to physically operate a clutch pedal, 
              the vehicle is deemed to be an Automatic Transmission Vehicle for the 
              purpose of the Class <span>3A</span>.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">What are the <span>offences</span> and penalties for driving an MTV with a Class <span>3A</span> <span>licence</span>? </span></strong><br> The offender will be charged for driving without a valid driving <span>licence</span> and may be fined up to $1,000 or jailed up to 3 months for the first 
              conviction. He will also be charged for driving without valid insurance 
              coverage and can be fined up to $1,000 or jailed up to 3 months, or 
              both. He will also be disqualified from driving for at least 12 months.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Can current Class 3 <span>licence</span> holders take ATV training lessons if they wish to?</span></strong><br> Yes. He can opt to attend an ATV <span>familiarisation</span> course. CDC has our own ATV <span>familiarisation</span> course packages, which may be tailored to the learner's individual needs and requests.<br> <strong><br><span class="faq_title">If I pass my Class 3 practical test recently but have a Class <span>3A</span> <span>licence</span> for a year or more, am I under probation? </span></strong> <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, you are under probation. This means your Class 3 <span>licence</span> may be revoked if you obtained 13 or more demerit points during the year of probation.</span><br> <strong><br><span class="faq_title">If I pass my Class 3 practical test within one year from the date I got my Class <span>3A</span> <span>licence</span>, do I need to display a probationary plate? </span></strong> <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes. You will need to display the probationary plate as long as you are still under Class <span>3A's</span> probation period. When your Class <span>3A's</span> probation period is over, you need not display the P-plate. However, 
              you will still be subject to the 13-demerit point rule under your new 
              Class 3's probation period.</span><br> <strong><br><span class="faq_title">If I get 13 or more demerit points while under probation and I have both Class <span>3A</span> and Class 3 <span>licences</span>, which <span>licence</span> would be revoked? </span></strong> <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Only the <span>licence</span> that is still under probation will be revoked. Therefore, if only your Class 3 <span>licence</span> is under probation while your Class <span>3A</span> has passed its probation period, only your Class 3 <span>licence</span> will be revoked. If both your Class <span>3A</span> and Class 3 <span>licences</span> are under probation, both will be revoked at the same time.</span><br> <strong><br><span class="faq_title">Do I need to get a new Provisional Driving <span>Licence</span> (<span>PDL</span>) when I sit for my Class 3 practical test?</span></strong> <br> It depends. Class 3 <span>PDL</span> covers both Class 3 and Class <span>3A</span> vehicles under the law and is valid for 6 months at one go. You can continue to use the <span>PDL</span> if it has not expired at the time you are taking the Class 3 practical test. Otherwise, you will have to apply or renew your <span>PDL</span> at $25/- at any of the driving schools.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Am I required to take Class 3 course lessons before I can sit for a Class 3 practical test?</span></strong><br> <span style="color: #0000ff;">You are not legally required to take the Class 3 course lessons. You 
              are only legally required to pass the practical test to prove your 
              competence. However, you may be required to go through the entire Class 3
               course syllabus to ascertain your competency level so as to ensure that
               you are adequately competent to use our vehicle for the test. The 
              progress of the lessons will be subjected to the learner's performance.</span><br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Can I use my own private vehicle for the Class 3 practical test? </span></strong><br> No. Cars used for instructional and testing purposes have to be insured for training and testing and must be approved by <span>LTA</span>.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">If I am undergoing MTV training currently, can I switch to ATV training? </span></strong><br> You are encouraged to continue with your current training lessons. 
              However you can check with your driving instructor if it's appropriate 
              for you to switch to ATV training as the change may disrupt your 
              learning schedule.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">If I had earlier booked for a date for MTV test, can I switch later for ATV test?</span></strong><br> Driver learners should advise to approach the customer service officers for any changes.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Can I apply for a Class <span>4A</span> driving <span>licence</span> if I have a Class <span>3A</span> <span>licence</span>? </span></strong><br> You need a Class 3 <span>licence</span>.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Can I sit for a Class <span>3A</span> practical test even if I already have a Class 3 <span>licence</span>?</span></strong><br> There is no need to take the test. You may opt instead for an ATV <span>familiarisation</span> course available at the driving <span>centres</span>.<br> <br> <strong><span class="faq_title">Can I book Class 3 and Class <span>3A</span> practical tests concurrently at the same driving <span>centre</span> but for different dates?</span></strong><br> This will push up the waiting time for other candidates. You will deny other candidates the chance to have earlier tests.<br> <br> <span class="faq_title"><strong>Can I book Class 3 and Class <span>3A</span> practical tests concurrently at different driving <span>centres</span>?</strong><br> </span>No. Students are not allowed to book for two tests at one go regardless of whether it is done in the same driving <span>centre</span> or not.</p>
