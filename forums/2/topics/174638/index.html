            <div class='col-md body'>Hm... after watching the video, my sentiments are:<br><br>1. The motorist was on the verge of getting violent, that was wrong, but he did have a valid point about the risks of being a motorcyclist compared to a driver.<br><br>2. The van driver was also well under control, and was right in taking the first step to calm the situation down.<br><br>3. The passenger in the van, by openly taking a video of them as well as talking back, was not doing anything to help clam the situation. If you watch carefully, the rider had actually started calming down, but got aggravated by the passenger again.<br><br>4. If you're not a motorcyclist, you're quite unlikely to understand how it feels. When somone consciously or unconsciously acts in a manner which would cause you to feel that your life is terribly endangered, would you not get angry? I feel that I am in a good position to answer this, as I am both a driver and a rider, and I know how it feels when drivers are nonchalant about motorcyclists' safety.<br><br>5. I am not Indian, nor am I racist towards them. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>judging from the conversation. Its seems like the biker was traveling on the middle white line. The lorry driver horn to alert the biker that the lorry is going to over take him and cautious to beware. When the horn did not work, the lorry got nearer and horn+ hi beam. The indian take that as a form of agitation and stopped the lorry to confront. Since the passenger has proof of road rage and vulgerities, he should just submit the video to the police and file a charge of vulgerities+road rage+hostile approach(bully)+threatening. That should be enough to make him go in for 6-12mths+fine up to 10k+official apology+license suspend.<br><br>This type of motorist, with that type of attidude is looking for trouble in future.<br>Anyway, keep our eyes open for that bike number. Best is who spotted him, gather a few frens driving to corner him. Hai ... so long no try 5 cars corner 1 car liao.... lolz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wouldn't say provoking. Listen carefully to what he said. It's about that guy taking a video. <strong>Seems more like he wanted to have everything sorted out before he left. He'd resolved his issue with the driver, and now the passenger wanted to aggravate the situation. If you were in the biker's position, and someone was taking a bloody video of you while you were pissed at them for having almost knocked you down, wouldn't you get even madder?</strong><br><br>Listen for a bit more and you can even hear the passenger say to the driver in chinese, "don't want to play then you stop for what??"
