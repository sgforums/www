            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Theatre Of Dreams:</div><div class="quote_body">any takers?</div></blockquote>I test drive the Ignis Sports few weeks ago... good performance and nice interior + exterior look and feel. If not because it's a 2-door car, i will seriously consider this car for normal road usage. I was test driving along the west coast road and at the traffic junction, i stopped beside a s-type jaguar. Not sure if the jaguar driver tried to compete with me on the standing-start acceleration, i managed to win him on pickup during the green-light go before hitting the next red-light junction. I step hard on gas (RPM hit to closing limit) of course but i guess the engine is extremely free-reving and still capable of taking those punishment  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>As for Daihatsu, not that i am biased but many car magazines have mentioned the suspension is still not good for the cornering especially for that high car body. Furthermore, the look is rather outdated now be it interior or exterior even though the engine power is still good for straight line sprint (maybe can even beat any 1.6 VVti and VTI)<br><br>GIven the budget of under 70K when buying car, i look for all rounded factor of the car and for me, i will definitely pick the Ignis Sports... just too bad it's only available in 2-door  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Suzuki engine also use the VVT technology same as YRV engine which it called as VVTi. Also, how did you hold the YRV first gear to reach 80km in auto mode? I know YRV has steer shift but how to downshift preventing gearbox from changing the gear, it does not has tiptronic or similiar equipped, right?<br><br>Anyway, you have made your choice... good for you. Enjoy your new car later once you have collected... One thing for sure the YRV insurance will be higher since 'Turbo' appears now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
