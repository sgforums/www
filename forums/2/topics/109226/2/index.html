            <div class='col-md body'>Ok Thumb1977,<br><br>I just read thru your initial post again and realized that you had done quite a fair bit of analysis and I must give credit to someone whom claims that he/she is not a car person. At least you got most of the "Please correct me"s right...<br><br>Â“European cars are usually heavy, thus higher fuel consumption. The price is usually more hefty compare to Japanese cars and Korean cars. But it is considered more sturdy and maintenance free (expensive spare parts?). Please correct me if I make a wrong generalizationÂ”<br><br>Alright, based on your analysis above, itÂ’s generally agreed that yes continental cars are as what you claimed. They ARE sturdier built, thus safer in the event of a collision but that makes them heavier than their Jap counterparts. In turn this translates into poorer FC. And yes, they come at a higher premium as compared to their equivalent. Take the 1.6L segment as an example:<br><br>In Nov when the Cat A COE was 22.5k, Renault MeganeÂ’s asking price was 86k, the baseline Peugeot cost 89k and the Octavia was asking 88k. Their respective average OMVs were 20.5, 21.6 and 20.4k. The equivalent VTi-L Civic and Impreza costs 76k each and their OMVs were 18.8k and 14.6k. Based on a 10 year linear depreciation these cars are losing at a rate of: Megane/7.4k, 307/7.7k, Oct/7.7k, Civic/6.6k, Impreza/6.8k per annum. The profit margins for their agents were: Megane/15k, 307/15k, Octavia/17k, Civic/10k &amp; Impreza/18k. (I did not include the M3 becosÂ’ I find the depreciation off-norm as the agent is really profit driven. The profit margin for a M3 was 22k and the depreciation was 7.3k pa; Ridiculous!).<br><br>As can be seen, the depreciation is higher for continentals than for Japanese makes. If you factor in interest incurred from loan then continental cars can easily cost you up to 9k a year. That works out to be roughly $800 a month already. Additionally, continentals are fewer by numbers on the roads so spare parts are not readily available either through stock or from the scrapyard. This is a very true statement from my friendÂ’s experience. His 9 year old Renault got into an accident that left its front bumper dented. He searched high and low for spares but to no avail. When he finally found one, it was sourced from Malaysia. The more frustrating part was it would cost him SGD 1k to bring it in and get it fixedÂ… My friendÂ’s Renault was sent to its grave a year later with the lips still twistedÂ… So, continentals are out of your wish listÂ… So are the 2 Jap 1.6L modelsÂ…<br><br>Â“Japanese cars are good for affordable price and reliable performance. Efficient engine also leads to lower fuel consumption. Parts are available readily but not cheap.  Please correct me if I make a wrong generalizationÂ”<br><br>Very few will disagree with this statement. I assume you would not mind if I add Thai-made Jap-designed cars in as well becosÂ’ country of manufacturing origin affects build quality rather than inherent design deficiencies.  However the clause on spare parts is very subjective. It depends on what brand you are talking about. Average brands like Mit or Nissan their spare parts can be quite reasonable. HondaÂ’s parts are always ex. EveryoneÂ’s riding on its name to maximize profitsÂ… Toyota parts are also reasonable though a bit more ex than Nissan or Mits. Not very sure about Subarus and SuzukisÂ… I will highlight a few possible candidates later.<br><br>Â“Korean cars are cheap, egs like Kia and Hyundai. If compare apple to apple with Japanese car, the price could be 10 to 20 percent cheaper. But very high fuel consumption and spare parts are very expensive and not easily available. Please correct me if I make a wrong generalizationÂ”<br><br>Generally correct again except the spare part clause againÂ… You may be right you may be wrongÂ… Of cse compared to jap parts there isnÂ’t a lot of compatible OEM parts for Korean makes so maybe thatÂ’s y u may feel that the cost of Korean spares are a little bit on the high side. Generally Korean engines are less powerful and have less Â“varietiesÂ” than Japanese counterpartsÂ… Their century sprints are 1 or 2 secs behind equivalent jap designs. E.g. the 1.3 getz needs 14.8sec while the 1.6 matrix requires 14.2 sec. Even the 1.4 83 HP Jazz manages only 12sec and the venerable 1.6 Lancer also comes it in 12 flat. Korean cars dun have those fanciful VVTi or VTEC or MIVEC stuff for their engine design and thereÂ’s where they fail to exploit the curves and envelopes in the engineÂ… When u fail to do that your engine is in fact drinking proportionally to the load added so at the end of the day you get slightly below average kind of FCÂ… However it may be too early to dismiss these Hyunkia modelsÂ…<br><br>Â“Malaysia cars, cheap car, cheap parts but not much of a brand name. Please correct me if I make a wrong generalizationÂ”<br><br>Once again, you are right. British Magazines simply labeled the Proton Wira and satria a Â“Disastrous DepreciationÂ” itemÂ… But some may highlight that this is one car that satisfy almost all your basic requirements and yet u may not need to spend up to 600 bucks a mth for the installment. Who can blame them for that? The 1.3 Wira (M) is only ard 46k and supposing u down 10% deposit, 2.3% for 10 yr loan, this car will only cost you $424 a mth. Surplus of $176 is enough to cover season parking and mthly insurance premium for the carÂ… U even get to cash in 4,500 as PARF at the 10th year. Sounds great? Yeah y not? But that is from an economical point of view. We need to consider other factors as well. If you ask me, my advice to you is: Take it out of your wish listÂ… BecosÂ’ you may need to travel to Malaysia on biz trip. Precisely you need to go where this car comes from thatÂ’s why itÂ’s not advisable to get one. Never mind the availability of spare parts and cheap maintenance costs; Look further... The Wira and Peroduas and now Gen 2s are the bulk of the cars on Malaysian roads. And itÂ’s been &gt;10 years (less Gen2) since they are in productionÂ… That timeframe is more than sufficient to train a novice the various ways to break into the car. With car thefts in Malaysia so rampant nowadays although you may not suffer the same fate as the unfortunate Estima owners in walking back home but you will fall prey to smaller-scale hunters that may just break into your proton/perodua and leave you stranded without your essentials like passports or cashcards stuff like that; not to mention your goodsÂ… So, these makes are also out..<br><br>Â“I would think Japanese car would be the most likely choice as they seem the best deal out, but I am still very open to other optionsÂ”<br><br>For me, I had helped you narrowed down your optionsÂ… Either Korean or Jap. After so much 2c worth, I can roughly summarize that you should NOT shortlist:<br><br>1. Protons &amp; Peroduas<br>2. Civic, M3, Impreza and any Cat B cars (All overpriced and over-spec items).<br>3. Any Continental makes<br><br>Let me go find out a little bit more on the suitable candidates before I reply you on what to shortlist.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This post is for replying all your 3 dilemmas:<br><br>My first dilemma,<br>Should I get a COE car or a new car?<br>I understand that with a budget of $600, I could get a new car of a low to moderate range. But is it relevant to own a brand new car for the sake of the cheap price now?<br><br>Is a COE car really that bad, as in terms of maintenance and spare parts?<br><br>If considering a COE car, what brands of the vehicle has better reputation of having a good deal?<br><br>What things to look out for if I really decided on a COE car?<br><br>No. You should not get a 2nd hand car, let alone a COE car. Especially with the cut throat prices for new cars nowadays. UNLESS you cannot down the minimum required amount stipulated by the showrooms then different storyÂ… Even then, thereÂ’s a $1 downpayment scheme available but as usual with fine printsÂ… Nothing fascinatingÂ… Just the usual statement requiring your mthly paypacket to be =&gt; 4x of what would be the loan amountÂ… If all these avenues fail, then consider 2nd hand cars. Even then, COE cars must not be considered at all. No doubt there may be a chance of you getting a COE car that is in tip top condition but the odds are almost as good as striking 4DÂ… DonÂ’t bet your hard earned money on that possibilityÂ… I reckon that u are better off taking $2 out to buy 4D rather than $2000 to Â“chu gu chiaÂ”Â….<br><br>Whether is it relevant to "chu sin chia" now becos of the price is actually dependent on you. Let me ask you. How long do you think you will be in your current job?  Assuming that you will adapt to the job and do well how long do you think you will quit and move on to greener pastures? 2nd, will sales line be the ultimate field of interest for you? If answer to these 2 quests are NO then you put me in a dilemma as well becos you are not focused enuff in the path you want to take in your career, then like what legal joe said, be it old cars or new cars that you buy it will certainly have a reversal effect if you don't plan well.<br><br>My second dilemma,<br>Which brand if I get a new car?<br><br>This will be discussed later. Like my previous thread mentioned. Wait for part II while I help u find out a bit moreÂ…<br><br>My third dilemma<br><br>What type?<br><br>refer to answer above..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CarDreamer:</div><div class="quote_body">Today saw a white city with spoiler... hm... not bad looking...<br>i guess city has a strange tyre and rim size with respect to the whole size of the car.. is like someone with alot of muscle at the top portion of the body then suddenly u c the feet, small small.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote>You finally spot the problem that makes pple feel City looks gawky and ulgy. Have u noticed Malaysian made Citys? They looked sturdier and better even while they are in stock condition. Reason is becos their stock citys are equipped with rims that looks bigger (though not really any bigger, just that their spokes are broader). This helps to proportionalize the car and its wheel. Also, their rear number plate is in trapezium shape; encompassing the entire plate mounting area. Local Citys come with standard rectangular plates that indirectly magnified the boot size so visually it gave people a disproportioned feeling... If you upsize the city's rims you will noticed that the boot is no longer that big when viewed from the side. Additionally with a spoiler mounted, the boot will looked more evenly built as people's focus is more on the spoiler than the whole boot itself. Dun believe? C for yourself again the next time u spot a city with a spoiler and an upsized rims... and compare this to a city fitted with 14" sports rims. U will see it's just all a matter of tricks on the eyes...</div>

I am very very sure I will be doing sales for the rest of my life based on the fact I enjoy meeting people.<br><br>Although equipped with tertiary education in mechanical engineering, I have learned to realise that I could never stay put in a place doing engineering stuff and excel in it.<br><br>Also with this new job, there is also a question of how long I will be with this company. But lets put it this way, I got other "moonlighting" lobangs that required frequent travelling.<br><br>Honestly I have a few choices now, Vios, City, JAZZ and Getz. But I am still not limiting my option. I have these few choices becoz they seem to be the most talked-about. I am actually interested in brands like subaru, Mitsubishi and Suzuki (Mazda is way off my budget), but I am not too sure of their models that fit my requirement.<br><br>This is something of the main topic, I am now considering renting a car for the time being. Anyone got any idea which one is the best? Cityspeed or NTUC(Hondadiraac got no west station)? Any advice?<br><br>Thank you so much for your info.

Please correct me if I make a wrong generalizationÂ”<br><br>Very few will disagree with this statement. I assume you would not mind if I add Thai-made Jap-designed cars in as well becosÂ’ country of manufacturing origin affects build quality rather than inherent design deficiencies.  However the clause on spare parts is very subjective. It depends on what brand you are talking about. Average brands like Mit or Nissan their spare parts can be quite reasonable. HondaÂ’s parts are always ex. EveryoneÂ’s riding on its name to maximize profitsÂ… Toyota parts are also reasonable though a bit more ex than Nissan or Mits. Not very sure about Subarus and SuzukisÂ… I will highlight a few possible candidates later.<br><br>Â“Korean cars are cheap, egs like Kia and Hyundai. If compare apple to apple with Japanese car, the price could be 10 to 20 percent cheaper. But very high fuel consumption and spare parts are very expensive and not easily available. Please correct me if I make a wrong generalizationÂ”<br><br>Generally correct again except the spare part clause againÂ… You may be right you may be wrongÂ… Of cse compared to jap parts there isnÂ’t a lot of compatible OEM parts for Korean makes so maybe thatÂ’s y u may feel that the cost of Korean spares are a little bit on the high side. Generally Korean engines are less powerful and have less Â“varietiesÂ” than Japanese counterpartsÂ… Their century sprints are 1 or 2 secs behind equivalent jap designs. E.g. the 1.3 getz needs 14.8sec while the 1.6 matrix requires 14.2 sec. Even the 1.4 83 HP Jazz manages only 12sec and the venerable 1.6 Lancer also comes it in 12 flat. Korean cars dun have those fanciful VVTi or VTEC or MIVEC stuff for their engine design and thereÂ’s where they fail to exploit the curves and envelopes in the engineÂ… When u fail to do that your engine is in fact drinking proportionally to the load added so at the end of the day you get slightly below average kind of FCÂ… However it may be too early to dismiss these Hyunkia modelsÂ…<br><br>Â“Malaysia cars, cheap car, cheap parts but not much of a brand name. Please correct me if I make a wrong generalizationÂ”<br><br>Once again, you are right. British Magazines simply labeled the Proton Wira and satria a Â“Disastrous DepreciationÂ” itemÂ… But some may highlight that this is one car that satisfy almost all your basic requirements and yet u may not need to spend up to 600 bucks a mth for the installment. Who can blame them for that? The 1.3 Wira (M) is only ard 46k and supposing u down 10% deposit, 2.3% for 10 yr loan, this car will only cost you $424 a mth. Surplus of $176 is enough to cover season parking and mthly insurance premium for the carÂ… U even get to cash in 4,500 as PARF at the 10th year. Sounds great? Yeah y not? But that is from an economical point of view. We need to consider other factors as well. If you ask me, my advice to you is: Take it out of your wish listÂ… BecosÂ’ you may need to travel to Malaysia on biz trip. Precisely you need to go where this car comes from thatÂ’s why itÂ’s not advisable to get one. Never mind the availability of spare parts and cheap maintenance costs; Look further... The Wira and Peroduas and now Gen 2s are the bulk of the cars on Malaysian roads. And itÂ’s been &gt;10 years (less Gen2) since they are in productionÂ… That timeframe is more than sufficient to train a novice the various ways to break into the car. With car thefts in Malaysia so rampant nowadays although you may not suffer the same fate as the unfortunate Estima owners in walking back home but you will fall prey to smaller-scale hunters that may just break into your proton/perodua and leave you stranded without your essentials like passports or cashcards stuff like that; not to mention your goodsÂ… So, these makes are also out..<br><br>Â“I would think Japanese car would be the most likely choice as they seem the best deal out, but I am still very open to other optionsÂ”<br><br>For me, I had helped you narrowed down your optionsÂ… Either Korean or Jap. After so much 2c worth, I can roughly summarize that you should NOT shortlist:<br><br>1. Protons &amp; Peroduas<br>2. Civic, M3, Impreza and any Cat B cars (All overpriced and over-spec items).<br>3. Any Continental makes<br><br>Let me go find out a little bit more on the suitable candidates before I reply you on what to shortlist.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hello Thumb,<br><br>Please refer to posts below...

            <div class='col-md body'>Discussion on previous comparison:<br><br>1.	Your favourite Jazz breached the $600 threshold but it has the best FC here. Owners claimed they forgot which side is the petrol cover every time they drive into the kioskÂ… Although you may spend a bit more on your mthly installment but you save equally much (if not more) from your petrol bills. You are in a better position to gauge if the xtra $46 is worth a try after considering the average mileage that you will be clocking each monthÂ…<br><br>2.	The Colt comes in 2nd highest and is equally sporty as the Jazz. It matches its auto-trans rival in having CVT gearbox, an equally fantastic engine (MIVEC) and versatile cabin arrangements (great for ferrying your goods). Although it may not beat the Jazz in FC but it has more gadgets like auto wiper, auto climate control and powered wing mirrors which the Jazz donÂ’t. However the ColtÂ’s seemingly lorry-based gear handle will require some getting used toÂ… The only other models that have this are MPVs in the 2.0L segment like the T.Picnic, H.Trajet and M.Premacy.<br><br>3.	The Altis and the Ignis will not only cost you the same in terms of installment bills but almost equal in road tax and petrol bills. The Altis needs no introduction and the zappy Ignis is sporty enough to pull itself out of your Â“is cheap but dun look cheapÂ” requirementÂ… I have many vendors (sales engrs) that come delivering goods to me in Altis so no surprise if you decide on this one.<br><br>4.	Next up is the Liana. Suzukis arenÂ’t the first name that will come to your mind in buying a jap car but they are credible car manufacturer. Recently facelifted and of European standard (Signal lights on the left, wiper control on the right), the Liana HB has a pretty sporty look but a rather vocal engine when pushed hard. Meticulous and of good Japanese built standards there is always enough room at the rear of this hatchback when you need one. Certainly, there are enough of them on the roads to convince you to think twice before disqualifying themÂ…<br><br>5.	At $572 and $554 respectively, the Swift and the March are the closest equivalents to Jazz and Colt albeit they dun have a hatch to matchÂ… I wouldnÂ’t dismiss them as a Ladies car but you may find the room within them a little too tight if you are not the average JoeÂ’s size kind of guy. Also, they dun provide as much space and seatsÂ’ flexibility to lug any outsized goods that you may have(although this may not be the case since you are selling electronic items but the problem will surface if you need to ferry them in bulk)<br><br>6.	This is the hottest category. Separated by a mere $50 a month, the Lancer, City, Sunny and the Vios had always been at the center of debate and arguments over which is better. The ones I had considered here are ALL manual versions. FC is not a problem cosÂ’ they can range from 14~18km/L which is good enough irregardless who does it with 14 and who does it with 18Â… Perhaps the other concern is build quality and thatÂ’s where the Vios and the City take a back seat. With only a simple T-shaped layout for its instruments and radio unit, the Lancer runs about with an old engine but does its job well. The Sunny will take u places but its interior feels as dated as the engine of the Lancer. Sad to admit, the rear legroom of the Sunny is not as roomy as what you would think due to its relatively shorter wheelbase. Although it is longer in length by 85mm as compared to the CityÂ’s wheelbase, you will be surprised to find that you sit more comfortably in the latter due to the CityÂ’s clever packaging of its interior. The cheapest amongst the 4, the Vios, is like the average that you get after you sum up and divide equally all the strengths and weaknesses of the other 3. No major plus points for me to speak about though but if you are looking for an average workhorse then get your answer by paying your nearest HDB carpark a visit at night and count the number of Vios owners who had decided on the answer to the question you haveÂ…<br><br>7.	This point covers the Korean makes in which by figures alone, makes you want to pick up that calculator and do the sums again for meÂ… They all fall below $500 a mth. They are perfect choices for those who are on a tighter budget than those who are shopping for a ViosÂ… The newest kid on the block, the Cerato, is priced at such a value that you wouldnÂ’t believe that it is $20,000 cheaper than a Civic or Impreza; considering that you pay the same road tax (difference of a few dollars) for the 3 of themÂ… The quality of the Cerato interior is on par with the Thai built Vios and it manages around 11~12km/L. Not bad at allÂ… The rest are cheaper but that is also because their engines are undersized compared to the Japanese models that I listed. The Getz are as popular as its larger sibling the Matrix (which I left out becosÂ’ its FC just cannot make itÂ… even considering manual versionÂ…The car is simply too heavy at 1.26 tonnesÂ…) and even though its interiorÂ’s plastic seems hard wearing it certainly cannot match up to those of Jazz or Colt. Well you pay for what you getÂ… Korean cars trade low mthly installments with high gasoline bills so in actual fact there isnÂ’t much of a tradeoff at allÂ… The minus points simply cancelled out any plus points. The only final conclusion I can make about getting a Korean car for you is that the costs of maintenance in terms of wear and tear for your kind of driving conditions may have you visiting the showroom again sooner than you expect even though their servicing costs are lower than their Japanese adversariesÂ…<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is one concern and lesson that I learnt from the recent tsunami tragedy with regards to car maintenance and that is the Â“Act of GodÂ” clause in our car insurance policy. Although everybody is so damned sure that we will never get covered by Tsunamis but remember back in March 2004 when 30+ cars were Â“drownedÂ” in an underground carpark in Ubi area during the monsoon season? Well, just a reminder that such acts of God is not covered in Insurance. Even if it is, it will always sway in favor to the policy maker rather than the policy holder. The lower the OMV is your car + the higher is the selling price of your car, the more you stand to lose when such things happen. Such incidents may be isolated cases and may only occur once in a blue moon but I wonÂ’t bet my $ on that blue moon cosÂ’ I only get back a fraction of my OMV and unused COE. Components like ARF, GST and profit margin to distributor are entirely transparent to the government and are non-refundable. So you are pretty prudent when you say you struck Mazda off the wishlistÂ… Correct cosÂ’ their cars have the highest disproportioned ratio of selling price to scrap value. Mazda cars are no doubt handsome but they may cause you to lose more than you think when the blue moon waxesÂ…<br><br>Once again, after such a long essay, the above are my point of views of what you should considerÂ… Although generally I still dun have an answer as to which specific model/make you should get but being a sales guy do remember that FC is always your top priority. No point burning your hard earned commission away with one car that helps you clock points with your smiles card faster than your NTUC link card. Personally my heart goes with those cars listed in points 1, 2, 4 and 6. Do a little bit more read-up especially on areas like after sales service and manufacturersÂ’ updates. Consider all factors. Look far ahead. From the day you learn to drive, to practical test, to viewing of cars, to buying a car, to maintaining a car, even to scrapping a car all are invaluable knowledge that can only be gained by experience. We can share as much with you our experiences but still, those are OUR experiencesÂ… So remember when u make your way down to the showrooms for a test drive of all the cars that interest you remember to keep cool and resist the temptation to sign on the dotted line till you scrutinized all these cars in detail. Ultimately you are the one who is gonna buy the car and spend perhaps 1/8 of your life span maintaining it so you must be extremely comfortable and proud of your own choice at the end of the dayÂ… If the next time you come back to the forum defending frantically the make of the car that you had chosen then I will be glad to congratulate you because you would have made a wise choice.<br><br>Lastly, I wished you a Happy New Year on this first day of 2005!<br></div>

At $572 and $554 respectively, the Swift and the March are the closest equivalents to Jazz and Colt albeit they dun have a hatch to matchÂ… I wouldnÂ’t dismiss them as a Ladies car but you may find the room within them a little too tight if you are not the average JoeÂ’s size kind of guy. Also, they dun provide as much space and seatsÂ’ flexibility to lug any outsized goods that you may have(although this may not be the case since you are selling electronic items but the problem will surface if you need to ferry them in bulk)<br><br>6.	This is the hottest category. Separated by a mere $50 a month, the Lancer, City, Sunny and the Vios had always been at the center of debate and arguments over which is better. The ones I had considered here are ALL manual versions. FC is not a problem cosÂ’ they can range from 14~18km/L which is good enough irregardless who does it with 14 and who does it with 18Â… Perhaps the other concern is build quality and thatÂ’s where the Vios and the City take a back seat. With only a simple T-shaped layout for its instruments and radio unit, the Lancer runs about with an old engine but does its job well. The Sunny will take u places but its interior feels as dated as the engine of the Lancer. Sad to admit, the rear legroom of the Sunny is not as roomy as what you would think due to its relatively shorter wheelbase. Although it is longer in length by 85mm as compared to the CityÂ’s wheelbase, you will be surprised to find that you sit more comfortably in the latter due to the CityÂ’s clever packaging of its interior. The cheapest amongst the 4, the Vios, is like the average that you get after you sum up and divide equally all the strengths and weaknesses of the other 3. No major plus points for me to speak about though but if you are looking for an average workhorse then get your answer by paying your nearest HDB carpark a visit at night and count the number of Vios owners who had decided on the answer to the question you haveÂ…<br><br>7.	This point covers the Korean makes in which by figures alone, makes you want to pick up that calculator and do the sums again for meÂ… They all fall below $500 a mth. They are perfect choices for those who are on a tighter budget than those who are shopping for a ViosÂ… The newest kid on the block, the Cerato, is priced at such a value that you wouldnÂ’t believe that it is $20,000 cheaper than a Civic or Impreza; considering that you pay the same road tax (difference of a few dollars) for the 3 of themÂ… The quality of the Cerato interior is on par with the Thai built Vios and it manages around 11~12km/L. Not bad at allÂ… The rest are cheaper but that is also because their engines are undersized compared to the Japanese models that I listed. The Getz are as popular as its larger sibling the Matrix (which I left out becosÂ’ its FC just cannot make itÂ… even considering manual versionÂ…The car is simply too heavy at 1.26 tonnesÂ…) and even though its interiorÂ’s plastic seems hard wearing it certainly cannot match up to those of Jazz or Colt. Well you pay for what you getÂ… Korean cars trade low mthly installments with high gasoline bills so in actual fact there isnÂ’t much of a tradeoff at allÂ… The minus points simply cancelled out any plus points. The only final conclusion I can make about getting a Korean car for you is that the costs of maintenance in terms of wear and tear for your kind of driving conditions may have you visiting the showroom again sooner than you expect even though their servicing costs are lower than their Japanese adversariesÂ…<br><br></div></blockquote>Thank you for your views and analysis.

There are a couple of reasons why people would prefer a 2nd hand car... Most of the time is becos of the way-low downpayment required of such kind of cars... Else is becos' of the price. Some may tell you for a one year old car u may be getting 8~10k off the price of a new one. Some may also tell you y not top up this 8~10k to get a new one? Well, 2 sides to a Coin... The one most important factor is the risk that you would be facing cos' the wear and tear situation of each car is vastly different. Although these cars may fall within the 3 year warranty period but some wear and tear items are not under warranty coverage. Dun be fooled into believing that EVERYTHING is warranted. No, that's not the case.<br><br>Viewing 2nd hand cars is one discipline of knowledge which is radically different from viewing new cars. Each car behaves differently after being used. You will never know what the previous owners did or got into any "lang ga" situations before or not cos' nowadays car repairs calls for the amputation of entire section and re-welding of these sections so even if you spend $123 and send it to VICOM for inspection prior to purchase you may not be getting the actual assessment of the car condition.<br><br>Its great to know you are keeping your cool amidst all the choices you have. Remember its a buyer's market out there so take your time to think about what you really want... Let me know if you need any help in viewing 2nd hand cars... Not an expert but perhaps I can help to look out for you some defects I experienced before... Cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
