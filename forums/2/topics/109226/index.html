            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br>I am planning to get a car (my first car) for my sales job and with so many options in the market I was thinking I could have some advice from the experts here.<br><br>Here is my budget: S$600 per month for installment (not including parking, insurance, and fuel)<br><br>1) I would be traveling a lot, so I would prefer a low maintenance car with cheap and readily available spare parts.<br><br>2) Efficient fuel consumption engine<br><br>3) I am doing sales so I need to get a car that dun feel cheap, even though it might be cheap ;o)<br><br>My first dilemma,<br>Should I get a COE car or a new car?<br>I understand that with a budget of $600, I could get a new car of a low to moderate range. But is it relevant to own a brand new car for the sake of the cheap price now?<br><br>Is a COE car really that bad, as in terms of maintenance and spare parts?<br><br>If considering a COE car, what brands of the vehicle has better reputation of having a good deal?<br><br>What things to look out for if I really decided on a COE car?<br><br>My second dilemma,<br>Which brand if I get a new car?<br><br>I am not a car person. I am not crazy about car. To me, it is just a mode of personal transport. So I only know how to differentiate the different cars by origin<br><br>European Brands, Japanese brands and Korean brands (Malaysia proton saga?)<br><br>European cars are usually heavy, thus higher fuel consumption. The price is usually more hefty compare to Japanese cars and Korean cars. But it is considered more sturdy and maintenance free (expensive spare parts?). Please correct me if I make a wrong generalization.<br><br>Japanese cars are good for affordable price and reliable performance. Efficient engine also leads to lower fuel consumption. Parts are available readily but not cheap.  Please correct me if I make a wrong generalization.<br><br>Korean cars are cheap, egs like Kia and Hyundai. If compare apple to apple with Japanese car, the price could be 10 to 20 percent cheaper. But very high fuel consumption and spare parts are very expensive and not easily available. Please correct me if I make a wrong generalization<br><br>Malaysia cars, cheap car, cheap parts but not much of a brand name. Please correct me if I make a wrong generalization<br><br>I would think Japanese car would be the most likely choice as they seem the best deal out, but I am still very open to other options<br><br>My third dilemma<br><br>What type?<br><br>Should I get a budget sedan like VIOS, CITY and etc or small hatchbacks like Honda Jazz, Hyundai Getz and etc?<br><br>Please advise me and feel free to tell me some of your experience.<br></div>

Now COE is cheap. And you don't have to worry about parts or their availability coz new cars are under waranty (their single most attractive point). Anything wrong, you can just drive to the agent and KPKB why like that, it's their responsibility to get the parts and have the car repaired without bothering you. Hassle-free. New engines after run-in are at their most efficient, coz every thing is clean.<br><br>On your first dilemma,<br>Whether is it relevant to own a brand new car  or COE car, maybe you should look at the depreciation. Some old cars depreciates more than a brand new car of the same class these days, so since you're not a car enthusiast, maybe a new car makes more sense given the reasons above if there's no substantial savings in depreciation if you get a COE car. Note however, you may have to hang onto the new car for at least a few years if you don't want to suffer the huge depreciation of selling a young car as the 1st owner.<br><br>Used, old cars can be really bad in terms of maintenance, depending on your luck and car, as much as one or two thousand within the first few months just the get the noises and rattles out and have it road worthy. The downside of not having warantee, is that if the workshop make a mistake on troubleshooting, you'll have to pay nonetheless.<br><br>However, COE cars have their pros too : There are some cheap ones in a good condition. And since you can choose one which don't require as long or as big a commitment in order to break even as new cars, they allow you react better to changes in situations. Go for the commonly-available Jap ones in this case as their parts are cheap and readily available becoz they come in different grades, according to your budget.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br>Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I guess the rest I shall cut it short.<br><br>Personally, believe at this moment the Vios is the car to get. My friend Vios (M) is getting about 14km/l, and after a 10k downpayment, the monthly work out to be about 600+ a month fpr 7 years loan.<br><br>And its a respectable car.

But is it relevant to own a brand new car for the sake of the cheap price now?<br><br>Is a COE car really that bad, as in terms of maintenance and spare parts?<br><br>If considering a COE car, what brands of the vehicle has better reputation of having a good deal?<br><br>What things to look out for if I really decided on a COE car?<br><br>My second dilemma,<br>Which brand if I get a new car?<br><br>I am not a car person. I am not crazy about car. To me, it is just a mode of personal transport. So I only know how to differentiate the different cars by origin<br><br>European Brands, Japanese brands and Korean brands (Malaysia proton saga?)<br><br>European cars are usually heavy, thus higher fuel consumption. The price is usually more hefty compare to Japanese cars and Korean cars. But it is considered more sturdy and maintenance free (expensive spare parts?). Please correct me if I make a wrong generalization.<br><br>Japanese cars are good for affordable price and reliable performance. Efficient engine also leads to lower fuel consumption. Parts are available readily but not cheap.  Please correct me if I make a wrong generalization.<br><br>Korean cars are cheap, egs like Kia and Hyundai. If compare apple to apple with Japanese car, the price could be 10 to 20 percent cheaper. But very high fuel consumption and spare parts are very expensive and not easily available. Please correct me if I make a wrong generalization<br><br>Malaysia cars, cheap car, cheap parts but not much of a brand name. Please correct me if I make a wrong generalization<br><br>I would think Japanese car would be the most likely choice as they seem the best deal out, but I am still very open to other options<br><br>My third dilemma<br><br>What type?<br><br>Should I get a budget sedan like VIOS, CITY and etc or small hatchbacks like Honda Jazz, Hyundai Getz and etc?<br><br>Please advise me and feel free to tell me some of your experience.<br></div></blockquote>Hello Thumb1977,<br><br>In order to effectively answer your question we need to "micro-manage" your requirements.
