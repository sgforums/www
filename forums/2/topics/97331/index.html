            <div class='col-md body'>For the past two weeks, after two full tanks of petrol... I see a drop of close to 60km/tank (13% of the total 450km/30litres.<br><br>Our Picanto is less than 2 months old.<br><br>I used to do an average of 15km/litre for Singapore driving and 17km/litre for rural driving BUT I have only been able to reach 13km++/litre for the last two tanks.<br><br>I did my 2nd service at C&amp;C-Ubi two weeks ago so I was quick to jump into conclusion that it was C&amp;C-Ubin service centre's fault (but I have yet to do anything about my assumption).<br><br>Last night, when I was at the petrol station buying coupons, I did a tyre pressure check. I was surprised to find that all the four wheels have different tyre pressure ranging from 183kPa to 199kPa. Recommended is 220kPa.<br><br>So, I believe this is the cause of the high fuel comsumption. I will start monitoring once again and update you all soon.<br><br>Lesson learnt; for thinking that the service centre will take care of the tyre pressure too. I did not check the pressure after switching from my original 13'wheel to my current 14'wheel too... so it could be either one... both told me that... the pressure is right...<br><br>For those experiencing high fuel consumption, do check your tyre pressure if you have not already done so.<br><br>Hope this helps...<br>Vincent<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Under-inflation is one of the greatest killers of tyres. Tyres running at less than optimum pressures can suffer a 25% loss in tread life due to increased shoulder wear. They are also dangerous. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Don't pump too much air into your tyres either. Gross over-inflation causes your tyre to bulge out at the centre. Which means that the centre of the tread will come into greater contact with road surfaces than any other part of the tread. So, the tread centre wears out earlier. Because an over-inflated tyre has a smaller surface area in contact with the road than properly inflated tyres, it suffers from reduced traction. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Over-inflation of tyres also increases the risk of bruise damage. That happens when your tyre hits an object but you can't really tell. Tyres which are grossly over-inflated also create undue strain on your car's suspension. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>A motor vehicle operating with 20% under inflated tyres will increase fuel consumption by 5% with an increase in CO2 emissions. Whereas 30% under inflation will increase fuel consumption by 10% with a corresponding increase in emissions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tips for reducing fuel consumption</strong><br><br>The way you drive and the condition of your car has an impact on the amount of petrol you use. Here are a few tips to help you save petrol and money.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">10 TOP TIPS FOR FUEL EFFICIENT DRIVING</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Minimise your vehicle use</span><br>Plan to do a number of errands in one trip rather than several trips and save both time and fuel. Try to avoid short vehicle trips by walking or cycling, this will save over a quarter of a kilogram of greenhouse gas emissions per kilometre of vehicle driving it replaces. Also avoid peak-hour traffic whenever possible.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Drive in high gear</span><br>The engine runs most efficiently between around 1,500 and 2,500 rpm (lower in diesels). To maintain these low revs you should change up through the gears as soon as practical and before the revs reach 2500 rpm.<br><br>Automatic transmissions will shift up more quickly and smoothly if you ease back slightly on the accelerator once the car gathers momentum.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Drive smoothly - avoid unnecessary acceleration</span><br>Drive at a good distance from the car in front so you can anticipate and travel with the flow of traffic. This avoids unnecessary acceleration and frequent repetitive braking that ends up wasting fuel. It's also far safer.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Minimise fuel wasted in idling</span><br>Minimise fuel wasted in idling by stopping the engine whenever your car is stopped or held up for an extended period of time. By having the engine switched off, even for a short period, you will save more fuel than is lost from the burst of fuel involved in restarting the engine. The net increased wear and tear from this practice is negligible.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Speed kills economy</span><br>High speeds result in high fuel consumption. At 110 km/h your car uses up to 25 per cent more fuel than it would cruising at 90 km/h.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. Minimise aerodynamic drag</span><br>Additional parts on the exterior of a vehicle such as roof racks and spoilers, or having the window open, increases air resistance and fuel consumption, in some cases by over 20%.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7. Look after your vehicle's tyres</span><br>Inflate your vehicle's tyres to the highest pressure recommended by the manufacture and make sure your wheels are properly aligned. Looking after your tyres will not only reduce your fuel consumption it will also extend tyre life and improve handling.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8. Use air conditioning sparingly</span><br>Air conditioners can use about 10 per cent extra fuel when operating. However, at speeds of over 80 km/h, use of air conditioning is better for fuel consumption than an open window.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">9. Travel light</span><br>The more a vehicle carries, the more fuel it uses; an extra 50 kg of weight can increase your fuel bill by 2 per cent.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10. Service your vehicle regularly</span><br>Keep your vehicle well tuned and reduce greenhouse gases by up to 5 per cent.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
