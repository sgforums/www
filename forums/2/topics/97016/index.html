No excuses for me. Formally, I am sorry, I apologise sir.<br><br>That said, if you are willing to hear (read) me out (if not, it's ok since I am apologising), it wasn't my intention to push you or anyone at all.

Don't worry too much about it. honestly, I felt that most ppl on e roads are going somewhere, they wouldn't exit at somewhere becos they feel paiseh. gawd knows how much of a hassle it is to turn off the highway at the wrong exit.
