            <div class='col-md body'>Hi natasha, about 2 weeks ago i had a similar experience at the junction from hougang turning to yio chu kang. i was at the traffic junction when a blue Lancer pulled up beside me. Now what caught my attention was his blarring music. A quick glance at his car and i realised that the driver was staring hard at me. he had that beng look, with dye hair. he was reving and making a lot of noise with his engine before the lights changed.<br><br>the moment the lights turned green, he grounded his accelerator. i just let him go, cause i am a person who does not race under any conditions. when he realised i was not racing, he braked hard till i caught up with him and he tailgated me for 2 junctions. horning and highlighting.<br><br>again when we approached a super long road he rev up and shot ahead of me like a formula one star. i signalled left and turned to my car park...<br><br>its funny that you reported a blue lancer. coz this incident happened just 2 weeks back and still fresh on my memory.</div>
