There were 2 riders out testing a couple of R1s on a German autobahn, they were from some tuning company. anyways they were at top speed when this big bad black Mercedes S class just speeds past them. they were totally stunned. because no ones every heard of cars passing bikes. but they just saw it happen. later, further down the road, the met up with the same black mercedes. turns out the 2 people inside were testing it out too. they were also tuners. u know what tuning company that was? Brabus. and the top speed was limited to whatever they were travelling at when they sped by the R1 because there are no tyres that could withstand the speeds the S class was capable of without disintegrating.<br><br>read about this in a car magazine when the mag's people went to do a feature on Brabus Co. apparently they were around when the merc overtaking the R1s happened even got the 2 R1s on pic too. Brabus? scary.</div>

Whereas a 996 Turbo can do 260-280 kmh all day long, a biker would need to be physically fit to sustain that speed for more than a few minutes. Other factors would be bad weather and road surface. Very few bikers would dare race with a car at 200 kmh in the rain on a bumpy road.</div>
