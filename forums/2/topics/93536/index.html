Luckily, she got money to engage lawyer and all the technical support in the world. Anyway, if one wants to buy USED cars, no problem, simply make a deal with the dealer. Tell the dealer that you send the car to VIACOM for assesment, if car in good condition, you pay else, dealer pay and also refund your deposit..</div>

The market situation now make it more affordable for people to buy brand new cars, so they should just do that.
