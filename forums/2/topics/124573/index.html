I mean would you really want to to look at all those gauges when you're driving on the road? It's only going to distract you... you're supposed to keep your eyes on the road... not the guages... I even know of ppl who put those guages just cos they look nice... their engine not even tweaked at all... I've got trouble just looking at the speedometer... heh...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
