            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I'm new to this forum and am looking for some advice with regards to the '04 WRX. Just got mine not too long ago and am looking for some responses to my questions.<br><br>1) I have heard that the run in period of the car is also a learning phase for your ECU, where it learns your driving patterns and determines the behavior of the car. I read this in an overseas forum about rexes. Thing is, what is the best way to run in your car and "train" your ECU to keep fuel consumption down? My current consumption is about 400km, to a full tank of 50 litres, pretty much regardless of how I drive. So far, I have maintained my rev levels below 4k. That makes out to be abt 8-9 litres per km. I saw specs for the WRX and feedback from people from other countries. I must say I have heard varying opinions, and would like to hear from Singaporean scooby drivers.<br><br>2) The other question in mind is, which petrol is most recommended for WRX, based on personal experience or feedback from others.<br><br>3) What other things do I need to keep in mind when it comes to running in the car?<br><br>Thats all for now folks. Have a good one.<br><br>-- Dan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Answer to:<br><br>1. The ECU is always learning and relearning, adjusting its parameters to the conditions. It is not a ONE OFF thingy. U cant train it to keep fuel consumption low. The Air Fuel Ratio and Ignition timings are more or less standard and is made to run rich in stock ecu.<br><br>2. 98 RON monimum for Scooby, not less.<br><br>3. While running in, vary your speed and do not drive at constant speed. Change gear regularly to put your engine under different loads. Do not exceed 3K rpm in first 1K and 4K rpm in the next 2K. Use mineral oil up to 3K. After that, synthetic.<br><br>Hope this helps.
