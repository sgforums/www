            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2060201.006/2060201.006.1M.jpg"><br><br><strong>Even more dynamism and attention to detail</strong><br><br>The SL 55 AMG and SL 65 AMG are now even more sporty and exclusive. Both outstanding high-<br>performance AMG Roadsters have made further substantial gains in terms of technology,<br>design and appointments and now offer an even more unique driving experience. Enhanced<br>AMG sports suspension based on second-generation Active Body Control, more direct steering<br>and new AMG high-performance brakes for both the two-seaters make for spectacular handling<br>dynamics. Meticulous attention to detail is also a feature of the new-look body and interior.<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2060201.006/2060201.006.Mini3L.jpg"><br><br>The enhanced AMG 5.5-litre V8 supercharged engine at the heart of the SL 55 AMG is equipped<br>with a new, higher-speed supercharger compressor and a larger throttle valve to optimise the<br>fresh-air supply. In addition, the installation of an even more efficient engine management unit<br>has boosted the output of the AMG V8 powerplant from 368 kW/500 hp to 380 kW/517 hp, while<br>the peak torque has been increased from 700 to 720 Nm. The new SL 55 AMG accelerates<br>from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.5 seconds (outgoing model: 4.7 seconds) and goes on to reach an<br>electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h.<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2060201.006/2060201.006.Mini12L.jpg"><br><br>The driving force behind the SL 65 AMG is the extremely powerful AMG 6.0-litre V12 biturbo<br>engine developing 450 kW/612 hp and a maximum torque of 1000 Nm, making this still the<br>most powerful production Roadster in the world. Impressive evidence of the phenomenal<br>power harnessed by the AMG twelve-cylinder unit is provided by the 0-100 km/h acceleration<br>time of just 4.2 seconds. Again the top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h.<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2060201.006/2060201.006.Mini9L.jpg"><br><br>Both AMG Roadsters feature modified AMG sports suspension based on second-generation<br>Active Body Control, specific measures having been implemented to reduce body movements<br>in dynamic driving situations Â– to levels even lower than those achieved by the outgoing<br>models Â– without impairing the excellent ride comfort. Greater agility comes courtesy of the<br>enhanced front-axle elastokinematics and the speed-sensitive power steering with a more<br>direct ratio and new valve control logic.<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2060201.006/2060201.006.Mini4L.jpg"><br><br><strong>Newly developed AMG high-performance composite brakes</strong><br><br>Both the SL 55 AMG and the SL 65 AMG are equipped with newly developed AMG high-<br>performance brakes which ensure optimum application of the brake pressure, extremely short<br>stopping distances and outstanding resistance to fading. The front axle on both models boasts<br>large composite brake discs with six-piston aluminium fixed callipers. The SL 65 AMG has 30<br>mm larger disc brakes all round and ultra-high-performance composite brakes at the rear as<br>well as at the front. Plus the top-of-the-range AMG V12 model is fitted with a multiple-disc<br>limited-slip differential with a locking factor of up to 40 percent for optimal traction.<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2060201.006/2060201.006.Mini7L.jpg"><br><br><strong>Exterior design characterised by even more striking dynamism</strong><br><br>On a visual level, the new-generation AMG Roadsters are distinguishable by their discreetly<br>updated AMG bodystyling, including more dynamically styled AMG front aprons with an even<br>more pronounced wedge shape and fog lamps ringed in chrome. In addition, the front apron of<br>the SL 65 AMG also incorporates side air outlets allowing optimal flow through the auxiliary<br>engine-oil cooler. Further unobtrusive yet highly effective model enhancement measures<br>include an AMG-specific radiator grille with black louvres and chrome highlights, new tail lights<br>with special AMG tinting, new high-sheen AMG 18-inch light-alloy wheels featuring new multi-<br>spoke styling for the SL 55 AMG and an AMG sports exhaust system with two sets of chromed<br>twin tailpipes featuring new V12 styling for the SL 65 AMG.<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2060201.006/2060201.006.Mini6L.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2060201.006/2060201.006.Mini10L.jpg"><br><br><strong>New interior with carbon-fibre trim and AMG RACETIMER</strong><br><br>Not to be outdone, the interior of both AMG Roadsters also sports an even more dynamic and<br>premium-quality look. New genuine carbon-fibre trim elements add just the right degree of<br>sportiness and reflect AMG's successful involvement in the world of motorsport. The AMG<br>ergonomic sports steering wheel with its specially moulded rim is now fitted with silver-<br>coloured aluminium AMG shift paddles.<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2060201.006/2060201.006.Mini5L.jpg"><br><br>Further new features include the AMG main menu on the instrument cluster, which displays the<br>currently engaged gear and recommended upshifts plus either the engine oil temperature, the<br>battery voltage or the RACETIMER. The new RACETIMER function allows the driver to record lap<br>times on private racing circuits, storing not only the time for the fastest lap but also the average<br>and top speeds as well as the lap length.<br><br>Both facelifted AMG Roadsters feature high-quality metal door sill panels with AMG lettering, a<br>new-look instrument cluster shroud trimmed in nappa leather with double topstitching above<br>the classic chronometer-design round gauges, a new digital clock, a ventilation outlet cover and<br>a new aluminium-look switch for operating the vario-roof. It takes just 16 seconds to open or<br>close the folding hard-top, a glass version of which can be specified as an optional extra. The<br>AMG sports seats, interior door panels and armrests are upholstered in fine nappa leather.<br><br><img src="http://www.germancarfans.com/news/2060201.006/2060201.006.Mini1L.jpg"><br><br>Greater ease of use than before is assured by the optionally available electric <strong>remote-locking<br>boot lid feature</strong> which enables the boot to be opened and closed with the minimum of effort.<br>Standard equipment includes a removable luggage cover which increases the boot capacity by<br>22 litres to 339 litres Â– more than any other competitor in this segment. A few easy moves are<br>all it takes to remove the luggage cover. As well as freeing up more boot space, this feature<br>makes loading easier and boosts the boot's utility value.</div>
