              <p>If you are adamant that what ever statistic you decide to adopt is correct and accurate, then don't let anyone stop you from doing so. Statistics may be hard numbers but ultimately, they would still require some degree of intepretation to draw certain conclusions.</p>
              <p>It seems to me that you have allowed yourself to draw conclusions based on stats that are convenient to your cause. </p>
              <p>Also, it is also apparent that you are quite quick to reject any information other than yours without actual knowledge of the technologies involved. ae86tofu works in the car industry for some time now and has easily the most knowledgeable among the car forumers. You should do sufficient and in-depth research before instantly slamming his/her posts. I would be slow to criticise him/her simply based on her vast experience.</p>
              <p>Lastly, as a matter of forum etiquette, it sure leaves a bad taste in the mouth when you start your name calling. The other forumers that have lent their voices in this thread had merely contributed information to correct your misconceptions and perhaps it is rather wilful that you should take such replies as a challenge and resort to personal attacks.</p>
              <p>Do hope you take in mind the above and post responsibly.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Toyota= toyota+scion+lesux+daihatsu+hino.</p>

              <p>for example.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im talking about largest car maker lea,</p>
              <p>in terms of production is toyota GROUP</p>
              <p>in terms of sales is GM GROUP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GM use a lot of rebadging, ultimately, they still able to sell to consumer correct or not? quality issue is beside the thread purpose.</p>

              <p>first of all, sg market is small to command good respect from TMC</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>take the WISH for example. obviously it is popular in sg, But until now have BM bring in?</p>
              <p>primary because BM have the picnic all the while. it is similar to the WISH only a bit better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thus, BM can only take what TMC feed them. and if they push hard to bring in the wish, will it sour the relationship between them? do you think TMC can find another AD for their car if they decide to abondon BM?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if this happen, all the other AD &amp; PI and whatever not company will queue up for the ADship. cos toyota car still command respect in sg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is all about business sense first, whereas consumer choice...see how lor. </p>

              <p>This is why I always have this feeling that Toyota is too cocky. Every cent earned is profit, but it seems like they can't be bothered about a small fry when they are already so rich and they also have a great reputation.</p>
              <p>Their cars are getting so boring, absolutely no soul. Only thing left is the reliability and now most other marques are catching up. I would dare say Honda's cars are equally reliable.</p>
              <p>Toyota's cars used to have bombproof build quality. The plastics used are soft to touch and things are nicely screwed together without and squeaks. Now their Thai-made cars are a pale shade of their Jap counterparts. Plastics used are hard and there's squeaks here and there.</p>
              <p>If this carries on, Toyota will only come crashing down due to their cockiness and complacency. And when they come crashing down, it will be a LONG way down because they are currently so high up.</p>
              <p>Added: Alright, probably they won't come crashing down. They are too far up to be caught up by other marques. But it's their reputation doing that and not exactly their cars.</p>

              <p>This is why I always have this feeling that Toyota is too cocky. Every cent earned is profit, but it seems like they can't be bothered about a small fry when they are already so rich and they also have a great reputation.</p>
              <p>Their cars are getting so boring, absolutely no soul. Only thing left is the reliability and now most other marques are catching up. I would dare say Honda's cars are equally reliable.</p>
              <p>Toyota's cars used to have bombproof build quality. The plastics used are soft to touch and things are nicely screwed together without and squeaks. Now their Thai-made cars are a pale shade of their Jap counterparts. Plastics used are hard and there's squeaks here and there.</p>
              <p>If this carries on, Toyota will only come crashing down due to their cockiness and complacency. And when they come crashing down, it will be a LONG way down because they are currently so high up.</p>
              <p>Added: Alright, probably they won't come crashing down. They are too far up to be caught up by other marques. But it's their reputation doing that and not exactly their cars.</p>

              <p>all,</p>
              <p>btw, do u have a class 3?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>actually the opening up of the PI market years ago do help to balance thing a bit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if not, consumer still struck with AD offering.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yeah, toyota is or rather BM is cocky at times, but comes to think about it, if this happen to any other AD like kah, CNC, Komoco..(eg.their sales is number 1 in sg). their cockyiness will show too. i so sure about it. it is the human nature to be complacent. cos in business sense, once u achieve a certain market share, u r considered accountable to the principle (TMC)...thus the complacency set in..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is not like china or usa, where it is the biggest market</p>
              <p>for car maker.. over there... they complete like no body business. (then again, all boil down to the insignificant market in sg...)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>fyi, honda PI account for 40% for last year sales. toyota 30%</p>
