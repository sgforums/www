              <p><br> Must be sports car then have 6 gears meh? Then what about the Fiat

              <p> </p>
              <p>And the WRX (non STI) has 5 gears. So it's not a sports car? So
                      the Evo IX GSR got 6 gears, its a sports car. But the IX GT only
                      got 5 gears, so it's not a sports car?</p>

              <p>I didn't say WRX non STI is not a sports car. Mostly cars with six gears are more to sports or high end car. Like STI or EVO. Not those without STI. U get what i mean?  I admit my knowlegde for cars is not good. And since he his car don't have six gears, why did he even comment on that? Den why don't i said lamborghini is a nice car to drive. But i don't own one.</p>

                              <p>hey nox, 2.5k rpm is actually the best FC u can get. y did i say
              so? is logical. let say u are cycling a bicycle. a mountian bike.
              if you didn't pick up speed and proceed to change to a harder gear,
              will it tire your leg faster(as in car 2k RPM) ? if you cycle your
              lighter gear longer and faster then change to the next gear, it
              take less effort to build up speed didnt it(as driving in car 2.5k
              RPM)?  same as if you keep on cycle on your lighter gear
              longer and to the max speed it can go and then change to the next
              gear, don you feel exhasted faster(reving to 4k or more RPM)? 
              do u actually think before you say anything here? and pls be a
              gentleman. u don need to use the F word don you? so ppl sentence
              filled with nth but yours filled with substance? cool. let me tell
              you, don learn from your parent mistakes. if you do not noe wat i
              mean, i will hereby remind you, use birth control. if you becomes a
              father, don mind giving me one of your puppies. thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              oh i will be gentlemen and please be assured that i have given it much thought before i put forth my thoughts into words.
              
              thanks for your physics lesson which is utterly redundant and serves no purpose but to confuse the average reader with your layman terms that doesnt make any sense. Hence i can safely conclude that you failed your physics or you do not even have a brain.
              
              which brings me to the next point as to why did ur parents gave birth to you. well i can safely say it with confidence that my parents did not make any mistake and it was all planned. but i cant say the same of your parents though for giving birth to a mr pseudo know-it-all.
              
              also as for me having puppies.. why wld my offspring be puppies as i am a human being.. but i cant say the same for u though cos ur parents are of canine ancestry???

              <p><br>theorectically yes. lower rpm = smaller combustion = lesser air and fuel mixture to create that combustion. You will of course consume less fuel then revving at a higher rpm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But that applies when the vehicle is stationary. Add the speed factor and.... its gets a little messy <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>The higher CC = more Torque CAN generated on lower rpms.</p>
              <p>I would say 1.6L cars are more efficient at around 2.7krpm - 3krpm. I'm not refering to WOT, but at 1/4 pressure on throttle shift at 2.7krpm will be best bet.</p>
