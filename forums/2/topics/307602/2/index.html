              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">u listen to ur engine smooth?? what are u talking about...i din know smooth is a word to describe an engine at high revs... means what... ur engine is machiam from a mustang??? at low revs... gonna die car one but at high revs then can sustain the engine combustion??? those rented car of urs engine will feel smooth only at low rpm...above 2 plus reaching 3 the engine will start to sound like a person struggling to breath...</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">yah sure.. burn a hole in ur pocket and then earn some bragging rights about how u flushed ur money through the exhaust pipe of ur rented car which is not even meant to rev in the first place....</span></p>
              <p>there is an optimal range for an engine... all the cars u listed above are 1.5 and 1.6 litres... their optimal range is around 2 if u are talking about fuel efficiency...</p>
              <p>yes sure.. their max torque is around 3 plus... but u sure u need that much torque??? which is like a few more Nm than if u shift up at 2???</p>
              <p>why are ur uncle and friend shifting up at 3 +... cos they stepping on the accelerator like no tmr.. like u loh... yes they are shifting up at peak torque... but their FC is going down the drain....</p>
              <p>and from the way u speak... i can tell u are an immature driver.. what traffic light F1... pls get a life... u can shift up at the redline to boost ur oversized ego and listen to ur engine get breathless with asthma but ur car will still be slow... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              yes the engine will struggle.. there will excessive clutch wear... but the fuel consumption will not be hihg.... where did u get ur idea from...
              
              anyways i said the rpm band for max efficiency of the engine is 1.5 -2.5 krpm... but i nv said u should shift up at 1.5k rpm ah... u can be crusing along at 100km/h at 6th gear and u rpm can be at 1.5k rpm....
