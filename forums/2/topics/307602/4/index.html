              fuel consumption is dictated by rpm... not whethere ur right foot is stepping on the pedal or not....
              
              ur right foot might not be stepping but if u rpm is at 5000rpm it will consume 5000 rpm worth of petrol...
              
              and may i ask why does usage of electricity affect fuel consumption... 
              
              seriously... u shld perhaps read up more.. rather than being so thick skin to go acknowledge brothers and pals anyhow juz bcos they supposedly is on ur side???
              
              pple in the know will know u are a quack.. and will juz flame u.. and is it or is it not a coincidence that pple that "sided" with u have the same level of technical condemness as u??? ahhahh

              <p>my car? my car consumes more petrol when its out of the powerband (less than 2000RPM) so lower the RPM DOES NOT MEAN that u're consuming less fuel. when u are the vehs powerband (the range where u get the most torque) u are actually saving fuel cos of the engine not having to overcome inertia when accelerating or while operating...rememeber y do cars consume more petrol when during start/stop traffic as compared to highways? simple. cos the engine is constantly moving and not having to overcome inertia unlike when moving off so efficiency is at its fullest...</p>

              <p>there is an optimal range for an engine... all the cars u listed

              <p>yes sure.. their max torque is around 3 plus... but u sure u
              need that much torque??? which is like a few more Nm than if u
              shift up at 2???</p>
              <p>why are ur uncle and friend shifting up at 3 +... cos
              they stepping on the accelerator like no tmr.. like u loh... yes

              <p><br>tofu if u have might noticed... all along i am speaking with reference to cars in the 1.5litre and 1.6litre range... so my estimate of 1.5k rpm to 2.5k rpm is to me acceptable</p>
              <p>and i drive an altis... above 3k rpm in rev i feel that its breathless... maybe this kinda thing is subjective.... but i always felt tt the 3ZZ-FE is designed for cars to rev from sub 1rpm when idling to 3 rpm when accerlating... for maximum efficiency...</p>
              <p>why do i say this? the max torque of the 3ZZ-FE is at 3800rpm.. according to what u are saying is true... then the powerband for my engine is ard 3000-4000...  but the ECU prgramme it to shift up at less than 3krpm everytime.. unless i totally floor it... my car confirm dun have close shift ratios nor veh high final drive... it has only 4 gear ratios... having the abover 2 characteristics will cause it to be extremely inefficient when crusing at speeds of around 100km/hr...</p>
              <p>which brings me to the point of fuel consumtption.. i still stick to the stand tt the lower rpm the less fuel consumed... it makes perfect sense... less combustion per minute less fuel consumed.....</p>
              <p>though ur engine might be overcoming inertia with less torque...doesnt mean it is consuming more fuel.... it juz means tt less torque is used to overcome inertia.. hence u pick up speed slower... it will consume more fuel only when u step harder cos u cannot stand the slow accelration....</p>
              <p>which also explains why in stop start situations u consume more fuel than in highway cruising.. i dun quite agree with ur explanation as above... what is the case is that when stopping and starting.. more often than not u are revving to 3krpm and more if u floor it... but if u are crusing ... most of the time u are doing 1.8krpm to 2.5krpm...hence this explanation coincides with what i have said in the above 2 paragraphs...</p>
              <p>as for why ur car requires higher rpm.. its cos 1.3 litre produce less torque so u feel the need to utilized max torque everytime u accelerate... and also perhaps ur engine is an oversquare engine.. which has a shorter stroke and hence sacrificing the low end torque... as to why u need to maintain higher revs at crusing is also partly due to ur engine being an oversquare engine and partly due to power output...</p>
              <p>which brings me to the next point... doesnt mean bigger engine have lower shifting point.. this is generally the case... but sometimes there are exceptions... like honda's b16a and b16b engines which have a max torque of 7k rpm and redlining at 8k rpm... sure u might attribute to it being vtec... but also partly due to the fact that the engines are oversquare engine... being bore larger than the stroke... (source: <a href="http://g-speed.com/pbh/b16a/index.html">http://g-speed.com/pbh/b16a/index.html</a>).. so engine design also plays a part... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              stick to the stand tt the lower rpm the less fuel consumed... it
              makes perfect sense... less combustion per minute less fuel
              consumed.....</p>
              <p>though ur engine might be overcoming inertia with less
              torque...doesnt mean it is consuming more fuel.... it juz means tt
              less torque is used to overcome inertia.. hence u pick up speed
              slower... it will consume more fuel only when u step harder cos u
              cannot stand the slow accelration....</p>
              <p>which also explains why in stop start situations u consume more
              fuel than in highway cruising.. i dun quite agree with ur
              explanation as above... what is the case is that when stopping and
              starting.. more often than not u are revving to 3krpm and more if u
              floor it... but if u are crusing ... most of the time u are doing
              1.8krpm to 2.5krpm...hence this explanation coincides with what i
              have said in the above 2 paragraphs...</p>
              <p>as for why ur car requires higher rpm.. its cos 1.3 litre
              produce less torque so u feel the need to utilized max torque
              everytime u accelerate... and also perhaps ur engine is an
              oversquare engine.. which has a shorter stroke and hence
              sacrificing the low end torque... as to why u need to maintain
              higher revs at crusing is also partly due to ur engine being an
              oversquare engine and partly due to power output...</p>
              <p>which brings me to the next point... doesnt mean bigger engine
              have lower shifting point.. this is generally the case... but
              sometimes there are exceptions... like honda's b16a and b16b
              engines which have a max torque of 7k rpm and redlining at 8k
              rpm... sure u might attribute to it being vtec... but also partly
              due to the fact that the engines are oversquare engine... being
              bore larger than the stroke... (source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://g-speed.com/pbh/b16a/index.html">http://g-speed.com/pbh/b16a/index.html</a>).. so engine
              design also plays a part... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>when u say yr max torque is @3800 RPM u DONT have to shift @ 4k RPM!!!! what i meant is that u shift when yr engine is @ close to its max torque....like 3K rpm...besides yours is an auto right? gear ratios are already significantly lower than that of a manual as u only have 4 speeds instead of 5...i rest my case....</p>

              <p>I've been following this thread silently (a lurker u may call) and finally decided to give my vote of confidence to n0x.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This thread is an interesting read and both sides argued well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, n0x is "more correct" when he said that the less rpm u deploy, the lesser fuel consumed. This is a no brainer. Fuel consumption is directly linked to the rpm of the engine. This analogy is akeen to the more rice u consume, the more carbohydrates you will receive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT, AE86tofu's argument went deeper and is more biased towards how to use a single drop of fuel wisely. He took into account of the sweet spot when u plot a graph of fuel consumed versus power output (typically non-linear), which perfectly makes sense in real life scenario...  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Summary:</p>
              <p>So what if n0x revs low, he's not getting the "sweet spot" power out of his engine even though it consumes less fuel per second in <em><strong>absolute terms</strong></em>. And hence he's not using a drop of fuel as wisely as you could have. (<strong>FUEL EFFICIENCY</strong>)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But hey, lesser rpm ===&gt; lesser fuel burnt is only what he's trying to imply that's all! (<strong>FUEL CONSUMPTION</strong>)</p>

              <p>Actually, if anyone one of you have noticed... this thread started off with the TS asking how engine speed will affect the engine's longevity. Then somewhere in the middle of that first page alone, it started to slowly involve fuel consumption... then by the end of that page, we have 3 full pages of intense debate, most of which is not related to the topic. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>ANYWAY... what pbeyondp sumed up is correct. Can't get any clearer than that. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p><br>thing is... i am not saying i have to shift at 4krpm... u said shift near 3800rpm... so if ur defination of near is +-800rpm... then erm meaning my powerband is 3000rpm to 4600rpm??? and my redline is 5600rpm...</p>
              <p>so hey suddenly i have an engine tt is akin to those continental cars with super flat torque curve throughout the entire rpm range...this cant be possible right...</p>
              <p>i have seen the dyno run of my 3ZZ-FE... the torque curve is a parabola... it rises to the peak at 3800rpm and drops off the same way...</p>
              <p>so what the ECU does is to maximise my fuel efficiency... i mentioned 3krpm... tt's when i am medium footed...</p>
              <p>if i am light footed... i can get it to shift at ard 2500rpm to 2800rpm... and i have done it often.... so can tell the ECU is trying in whatever ways to juz keep it in the 2krpm range... which is hardly anywhere near 3800rpm... bcos the 2krpm range is enough to overcome inertia and get ur car picking up speed....</p>
              <p>and my gear only has 4 speed... like i said it cant have close ratio and high final drive.. .neither can it have high gear ratios throughout like what u mentioned....imagine if my 4th gear is still above 1.000:1 ... then i will be crusing at 100 at 3 plus rpm... inefficient ....</p>
              <p>if u need to know... the ratios are:1st - 3.643:1 2nd - 2.008:1 3rd - 1.296:1 4th - 0.892:1 and final drive 2.962... to me these are not veh high... i think its pretty evenly spread out though btw the 2nd and 3rd is quite far apart....</p>
