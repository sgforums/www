Probably we can learn from him on how he earned himself a ferrari.<br><br>Now, the article is trying to tell all the readers that "If you have a rich daddy, you can be like him having a ferrari as birthday present".<br><br>So, what is the purpose of the article? Trying to tell people to find a rich daddy?<br><br>In my opinion, I think instead of putting up such a stupid article, the editor should have article like "He bought himself a ferarri with his own money... this is the way on how he did it.....".<br><br>I guess the published article actually shows how good  the quality of singapore newspaper is.<br><br></div>
