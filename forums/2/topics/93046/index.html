            <div class='col-md body'>About parking lots and rights to one.<br><br>Personally, I think if you're there first, and waiting for one nearest you ( in front of your car ) you have the right to claim. Anyone leaves a lot behind you, and someone else spots it first and occupies it, you have no rights.<br><br>To me, getting a parking lot requires targetting. Look for potential lots, cars or drivers walking to their cars, and go wait there. Or, spot one far away and go for it quickly. Turn on hazard lights and stop in front of the empty lot till cars behind you passes by. Don't drive foward too much and allow the one behind to simply slide into it! Block it first, than reverse into it.<br><br>Always works. Better still if you go further away from entrances into shopping centers in basement carparks, no one likes to walk so plenty of lots to park there.</div>
