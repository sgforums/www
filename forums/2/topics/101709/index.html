Also, try to remove the rpm limiter so your car can go at 230+.

            <div class='col-md body'>Journey is usually safe. Just keep the habit of locking your car. Cases of car robbery happens usually at traffic light and your car is not locked. Or when you stop your car with your car being unlock and unattended (E.g. Petrol station). So, keep a good habit, but do not worry unduly. Just make sure car is locked whenever GF is in car alone.<br><br>Directionwise, there is usually only two places where you might get terribly confused. One is getting on the highway in JB. The other is after exit near KL and turning onto Genting. If you already farmiliar with JB, then that one should not be a problem. For the one near KL, all I will advise here is that follow the sign to Kuantan. If you follow that, you will get to Genting. Genting is along the road from KL to Kuantan.<br><br>Carwise, you will have to go down to gear 1-2 in several places near the top. So, be prepared for that. Personally, that is where I find the most fun to play with gear. Feels cool to have the constant need to switch gear all the time. In fact, I was like playing daytona on the way up. On the way down, be warned! Don't go too fast. the downslope makes the car accelarate easily and the winding road is fun, but that is also where it is most dangerous.<br><br>For a map, just go to another big bookstore either in Singapore or JB. It is quite easy to find one actually.<br><br></div>
