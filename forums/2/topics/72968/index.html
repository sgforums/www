            <div class='col-md body'>hi..hope i can help abit. just some insights on the difficulties u are gonna face.<br><br>First of all, if i am not wrong, the GTRs were not sold in Sg, not even by Nissan. So import is the only way.<br><br>number 2. If you want a GTR, prob u need to fork out lots as they are out of production already (even in Japan) and those left in Japan wouldnt be shipped over so easily.<br><br>GTTs are more common, if u just flipped to classifieds on Sat, you would mostl ikely be able to find some there. I rem last week there were even two GTRs (or so they claim) for sale.<br><br>number 3. Such cars....if the dealer tells you that the previous owner was a 80 yr old hag that uses it for a once in a month shopping would u believe? So expect the car to have been tried and tested quite to the limits already.<br><br>Yups..thats about it.</div>

It's malaysia owned, why the heck can't they make it more affordable..  implies that JUST because it is malaysian owned, its no longer worth paying that much for a car whose dynamics are near beyond reproach.<br><br>other than point out that what y**'ve said does not make sense because for a performance car like Lotus to be cheap, is like asking why the heck can't they make Ferraris cheaper, I have said nothing against y**. Y** choose to consider my pointing out of certain important points as flaming, so be it. and in return, start the "look in the mirror" bullShit, so be it.<br><br>I think we all know who was the one really flaming here without so much as a thought.<br></div>
