Not everyone can support a sport car. With its monsterious FC and skyhigh insurance, you will be spending around 300 more.

From all sources I have, it doesn't take you much to support Kelisa. Kelisa has relatively low maintainence cost, only 1k is needed with $500 installment included. With that $500 extra, he can at least go for Jazz or its like. Although his stand of spending only 1k per month is quite questionable. Not insurance? No family committments? No study loans?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro, i wll recommend you to buy a new car.. Just an eg: Lancer Manual Sports<br>now cost 63k, and down payment is 10 percent, if you pay for 10 years, every month is less than 600.<br><br>With a new car, you don't have to think of the problems that might arise from a second hand car. The car could have met with an accident badly and was quickly sold to the dealer.. parts might broke down over time due to wear and tear if you buy cars that are more than 10 years.. You might need to change lots of stuff and with that amount of money, you can pay for the maintenance of a new car..</div>
