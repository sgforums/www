Hope you dont mind I copy your post.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Hi All,<br><br>Really a pity for Lisa name to have been blacklisted as a matter of fact, in most of the forums where the topic 'rental' is concern. Well, if there's any of Lisa co-workers, friends or Lisa herself is reading these, really no offence to you but this is only for the benefit of the rest in doubt I strongly feel so.<br><br>About 4 years back when I was also in a desp situation looking for rental companies whom rent out cars to P-plate, I actually bump into her Ad as her is Ad is in fact everywhere on classifieds.<br><br>The first impression was already no good, but i just take it easy and not be so fussy as I was really anxious in finally getting a car to rent. Though minor one, but impression was such as I've book a specific car for about 3 weeks in advance for a manual one, as I don't know anything about Auto cars during those days and tell her umpteen times that I'm just a newbie, totally not ready to try new type gear car and morever that first time is I'm bringing my family out. I wouldn't want to harm them in anyway if I dun find auto car comfortable for the first time. But as usual, when the day comes she claims that she has no more manual cars and left only autos. Normal situation, I would have just gone home and not go for the Auto cars, but that day is a big occasion day with my family and all are set waiting for the car to arrive. Therfore i have no choice but to learn roughly on how to operate the auto car and straightway I'm all alone from there. (no doubt there's nothin much to learn in auto, still i wasn't that confident that time) Imagine she dun exactly honour her words or at least be commited on her words to customer but rather just be greedy to get ppl to rent her car and she's not bothered by anything else.<br><br>That was my first time renting from her, right after renting from her, I still did rent from her a few more times after that, but every of the rental gave me a more bad experience, (bad to worse) such as, vehicle breakdown in the middle of the road upon telling me the car just serviced. (like what the .. ??? )<br><br>Car battery flat at traffic light just after collecting the car near her blk at bishan. engine cannot even be restarted ....<br><br>I mean I tried as hard to ignore those negative effect from her car rental service, but at the rate she's going, I have to finally stop renting cars from her and switch to cityspeed car rental; though there's always some flaws here and there from rental companies, even cityspeed, but cityspeed was really 10times betta than her service I've acquired from in the past in terms of service, commitments, convenience especially and many more.<br><br>After 3 years with cityspeed, I have cancelled my membership with them not due to anything bad from cityspeed, but I've finally bought myself a car. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Not so grand or posh cars, but just the new mits lancer manual and I'm enjoying my car very much.<br><br>Thus thru my this long post, hope I've shared my bad experiences with you guys and you guys would know where to and where to NOT rent from.<br><br>To the threadstarter, yes this is a good thread as this could be one of the main biggest thread of all the forums available for the topic on rental of cars related experience and information.<br><br>Cheers and enjoy !<br><br>- Speed is nothing without control -<br><br>Regards ...<br><br></div>
