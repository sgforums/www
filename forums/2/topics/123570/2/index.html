She has a matrix..corolla and 2 trajets I think. The prices are affotrdable but my sister had a bad experience with her toyota. She booked long term. Somehow the car got into some kinda problem. Not once but on 3 separate occasions the engine just give problems. The owner tell my bro-in-law to send it to the w/shop and he had to wait at the w/shop....she did not even offer another car as replacement or compensate the tme wasted at the workshop. I mean, come on.....they rent the car for outings...not for standing by at the workshop. In the end, they terminate the bond.</div>
