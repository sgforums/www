They either use speed cameras or if they want to physically haul the driver over, they'll set up road blocks. Or they can simply radio ahead for another car to intercept in front... No way one can escape in a car, at least not in singapore.<br><br>Anyway i don't think police cars are modded... imagine what a bad image that'll give the police force, if their cars are fitted just like the guys they're meant to catch, with giant tailpipes booming away...</div>

Yes, they can nail you for dangerous driving, but I think if they cannot stop you, they will not start to chase you. This is the job of the tp, not the npp./ npc<br><br>As for expressway patrol car, I believe that it is modded. Imagine a standard S40 or a bmw 320, already difficult to catch up with a already speeding normal car, let alone catching up faster sport cars.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

What you saw is that the driver floored the accelerator and 'gun' the gear. They don't have to care about FC, gearnox replacment, clutch replacement and so forth. They can always go back to their station and get another replacement car. Police cars are normally scrap at 7th year.<br><br>The expressway patrol car are also not modded. They are already high perfomance vehicle like the S60 turbo, so naturally they are fast.<br><br>So the story is we can beat them anytime if we discard FC and is ready to pay for a hefty repair bill but who would be a fool to do that...<br><br>cheers!</div></blockquote>the express petrol r tune to squeeze all it can out of the stock engine...<br>and some slight mods r done to them...not heavy one... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
