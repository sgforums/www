But being 60K+ for a 1.3, it seems ex.<br><br>Swift is also quite high for my budget, but I heard the "swift" series had been quite reliable, so do give it a test-drive went it is out in the show room. Should be after the motorshow.<br><br>Picanto, it is cheap and cute looking. But the idea of it being a korean made does makes me avoid it. So is Getz. Anyway, seem you seems to be able to afford it, Getz would be a much better choice. Result is Getz had being getting tons of good review from the foreign reviewer. The specs and price seems to be everyone's first choices. My friend test-driven Getz 1.6(Auto, 56K), it has to much more thing than Getz 1.3(Auto). My friend is quite please with its performance. Too bad he wanted a manual, so have to wait for one to test drive.<br><br>Lastly Aveo, everyone I asked to test-drive it said it isn't that good. However I feel that it seems OK. Anyway this is the only car I test-driven so far (manual). Gas a little sluggish, but speed picks up well at the 3rd gear. The handling seems eletronic, as in not much feel. But for me I like the looks and these things I don't ready bother that much now. Maybe after I test out other cars, then I can comment better.<br><br>Anyway, test drive is still the best way to find out, after you sort out your financials. And of course find out which maker is reliable or if you are willing to make the risk.</div>

The engine is too noisy and it has very little power.. only 1.1L. so i gave up on that.<br>More keen on swift now, waiting to test drive it the first week of dec. looks nice, a jap car n seems reliable. price abit steep tho.<br>why arent you considering vios? 60K ..i think its value for money, jus not very keen with the overall design, too common-looking.<br></div>

Sorry if I got you wrongly, did you say Aveo is as small as Picanto? Now I can assure you that Aveo is much larger that Picanto, ......maybe not too much larger.<br><br>Anyway, the front seats are spacious and the rear can fit in 3 middle sized ladies with much comfort. 3 man can squeeze in too, but on a shoulder to shoulder seating. A little like Vios.<br><br>Picanto, 2 man is all you can put in the rear. Ladies might have to squeeze behind. Front seat, for manual, touching the passenger's thigh would be inevitable. The front storage compartment can't open fully with a front passenger seated.<br><br>You must really go and see those cars with your own eyes. Aveo was actually commented for its decent space, losing to Getz only because of its design of the boot. Seems to affect the size of the item you can place in the boot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hows the fuel consumption</strong><br>Fuel consumption for pica is good, if driving leisurely with windows open can achieve 21km/l, with aircon on 18 to 19km/l. If fast and furious type can achieve 17 to 18 km/l. I monitored my FC for my first 6 pumps, 2 times before 1000km, 2 times after 1000km, 2 times driving fast with aircon on.<br><br><strong>Full tank cost.</strong><br>Full tank depending on what petrol u pump, I pump 95 cost me abt $42 with discount. Now pump Vpower cost abt $46 but can last longer and more power.<br><br><strong>Can it achieve 100km/h without any difficulty?</strong><br>It can definitely reach 100km/l with no difficulty.<br><br><strong>Does it have lots of maintenance problem, izzit lasting</strong><br>Until now there is no maintenance problem for my pica, whether it is lasting depend on how u maintain the car, if u take care of the car sure it can last, but if u abuse it, of cos it won't last.</div>
