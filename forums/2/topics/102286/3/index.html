As we know flooring will increase your FC. Comparing cars like Vios which is lighter and thus a little gas could already set the car flying. There is also this thing about the percentage of the power of the engine got transfered to the wheel, I think got a technical term for that.<br><br>Most car clock that amount. But with the introduction of cars like Jazz, people's expectation of FC risen. And cars commonly reported to have about 10km/L will be rated as a car with weak FC. There are serveral cases of people changing cars and clocking a very much different FC. Thus it is always a good guide to ask around for the general average that particular made is clocking. Don't see much Vios with a FC of 10km/L, do you? Then again, having a small cc car will generally yield a decent FC.<br><br>As for the bad mouth part. Many was advised by friends who own that car themselve. I know 3 Getz driver, but 2 were frequent visitors to the workshop. As times goes on, news spread and usually it is the bad news. That is branding. It takes time to build, but a little shake will everything down.<br><br>Conclusion? I still think Picanto is a decent car that can cruise easily at 90-100km and have a reputable FC. As for the reliability issue, please buy 1 and feedback to us in 3 years time. Thanks! I will contribute my part with Kelisa.</div></blockquote>I honestly enjoy reading this post of yours.<br><br>Honest reply with logical answer!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It's the cubic capacity of the engine in your car. The higher the CC, the better it performs (usually).<br><br>To answer your second question, generally yes, manual transmission cars are more fuel efficient than automatics. However, there are many other factors which could cause a manual transmission cars to have bad fuel consumptions e.g. driving habit, unneccesary load on your car, tires not properly inflated, excessive idling etc...<br><br>Your third, automatic or manual, if you are a heavy footer (floor your accelerator) most of the time, then FC will always be bad.<br><br></div>
