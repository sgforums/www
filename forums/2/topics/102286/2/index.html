            <div class='col-md body'>i just got my picanto 3 weeks ago and he just turn 1 mth old. so far the car is ok. my FC is about 11.8 km per l. according to most forums, auto is about 12 like tat. so far is ok. but quite a few say tat it can reach until 15 when the engine runs in<br><br>mine is a opc so each mth pay abt 286 for 10 yr loan. insurance is abt 2.335 as based on 3 yrs driving exp and 25 of age.<br><br>thos prob like noisy engine, signal cannot turn off automatically, so far i dun encounter that. mayb is due to different batch of picantos. Yes, it is a small car but i think if u compare to other cars like those old version of march, kelisa, ..etc...picanto is much bigger tats part of te reason y i choose picanto too. My dad is like moses lim size and he can fit into te car so i dun think y it cannot accomdate 3 ppl bhind lor..yes..it mayb abit squeezy but after all, he is a small car..tats y call picanto <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Only buy Picanto if you intend to change car within 3 years. Small Korean cc cars cannot last too long. A good example is Hunydai Atos. Use to be a popular budget car 1-2years back, and now don't see much on the road. Korean cars technology is improving, buy currently I still wouldn't consider them especially Kia.<br></div>

Cheaper, better FC, better power. That is true for all small cars.<br><br>I do believe Kelisa's engine has a better/ more responsive engine. Cause of its double cam as compared to Picanto's single. But because of its 3 cylinder design, it is also believe to be more shaky and noisy. Plus it is small and lighter, more power to weight ratio, but watch it, you might hit the roof. Do test-drive both cars to be sure. But be warn, kelisa's dealer in Singapore isn't quite friendly/professional. Usually it is best to service over the JB's center.<br><br>I drove a Kelisa. Standing at 1.64m and 72 kg, I find it comfortable. My best FC so far is 17.4km/L, on my 8th pump. Love it when I overtake people with the 3 gear at 4000rpm, up the slope. And I am not stranger to 5k rpm, though usually 4k is enough.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/Kelisa/start" rel="nofollow">Singapore Kelisa Club</a></div>

My neighbour have being driving Hyundai Accent for 5 years, so far no problem. And also have few friends drive Kia and hyundai cars, no complaints from them.<br><br>As for FC, usually for:<br>a.

I drive alone, so average 16km/L for manual even though I rev about 3000-4000rpm. 1 tank I think I keep taking passengers and doing small roads and jams, become 14.8km/L. I was always shocked. But now return to normal 15.9km/L on the last run. My kelisa is now toward the end of run-in stage.<br><br>Aircon differences usually by 2km/L. Anyway, if you are thinking of Picanto or Kelisa, don't worry about FC. Cause if you get lousy FC with these cars, you will do worse on others, except for Vios, City and Jazz. These 3 cars are either FC-wise or so strong that you don't have to rev.<br><br>Test-drive first, it is free. Test-drive auto if you are interested, I think kelisa auto will beat picanto's auto, in terms of power.</div>

In the end, I got a Kelisa.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>What I did is I just test-drive. Whenever the SE offered a seat and wanted to discuss pricing, I will decline saying I need to decide on a car model first. That way, you can easily test 3-4 cars in 1 afternoon. But if you are serious, at about the 4th - 5th car, can sit down to have a chat. Just to know where you stand financially.</div>

What you don't see is the number of times they "run" to their workshop. I have Getz driver visiting the workshops on a monthly basis. But that is the first few batches of Getz. Now it seems better.<br><br>Anyway, Picanto may or may not last. So is Kelisa.

As we know flooring will increase your FC. Comparing cars like Vios which is lighter and thus a little gas could already set the car flying. There is also this thing about the percentage of the power of the engine got transfered to the wheel, I think got a technical term for that.<br><br>Most car clock that amount. But with the introduction of cars like Jazz, people's expectation of FC risen. And cars commonly reported to have about 10km/L will be rated as a car with weak FC. There are serveral cases of people changing cars and clocking a very much different FC. Thus it is always a good guide to ask around for the general average that particular made is clocking. Don't see much Vios with a FC of 10km/L, do you? Then again, having a small cc car will generally yield a decent FC.<br><br>As for the bad mouth part. Many was advised by friends who own that car themselve. I know 3 Getz driver, but 2 were frequent visitors to the workshop. As times goes on, news spread and usually it is the bad news. That is branding. It takes time to build, but a little shake will everything down.<br><br>Conclusion? I still think Picanto is a decent car that can cruise easily at 90-100km and have a reputable FC. As for the reliability issue, please buy 1 and feedback to us in 3 years time. Thanks! I will contribute my part with Kelisa.</div>
