I tend to give them a wider berth on the roads in case they make sudden unexpected turns, brake suddenly or drift into neighbouring lanes.

However I notice that no one uses middle finger or gets upset they just honk and everyone's used to it. If you use your horn in Singapore, drivers tend to get upset very easily. I think it's mentality in the end. I noticed that many drivers here assume once they signal, it means you must give way to them.

I generally assume he's going to be going faster so I'll stop behind him at lane 1 too. 7 out of 10 times that person will be the slowest of the 3 lanes even though lane 1 is supposed to be the fastest, overtaking lane, whether it's on a normal road or expressway.
