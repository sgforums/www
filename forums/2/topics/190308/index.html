            <div class='col-md body'>Was told by one of my friends that I can post the incident and seek help in this forum and at the same time share my experiences. I was driving on Loyang Ave from Changi Beach this late afternoon when I met a reckless and impatient driver. I was driving my 2 little cousins along this road when I saw a Bronze/Brown Hyundai SUV approaching me at high speed. I was on the left lane and traffic was light. This SUV high beam and tailgate me even though there are space to over take all these time. I ignored her and kept in my lane for about another 100 plus meters or so but she kept on tailgating me. I then slowed down so she will give up her tailgating and overtake me and this is when it cheeses me off. She made a sharp right behind me and when she came along side me I saw a Caucasian lady wearing sunglasses shouting hysterically and making some hand signs at me. As soon as her bonnet passes my car she cuts back left sharply and jammed brakes. This cause me to hit hard on the brakes to avoid collision and she sped off. I only remember the numbers to be Sxx 7373 x but cannot recall the prefix alphabets as I was in shock. In the process one of my cousins was scared stiff and has seat belt marks on her shoulder. I wanted to make a report but do not have the full details of the number plate. Please look out for this Bronze Hyundai SUV driven by this Ang Mo lady in Loyang area as her actions are reckless and inconsiderate. would appreciate if anyone could send me a msg on her car plate. She really gives the Expat living here a bad name.</div>

Because if shes really in a rush and you didn't let her overtake you on the right then its somewhat your fault.. But if she was having her PMS and there was an empty lane on the right for her to overtake you and she still insist on playing with you then she has every right to be thrown into jail or fined at least.<br><br>Still i will keep a lookout for her and maybe give her a lil' lecture - Singaporean Style.</div>

She has all the space and time to overtake. Anyway thanks for replying fellas.</div>
