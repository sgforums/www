              <h1 class="clr">More motorists opt for bi—fuel cars to cut costs, save environment</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: More motorists are converting their cars to run on two types
              of fuel — compressed natural gas (CNG) and regular petrol.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, CNG conversion workshop C. Melchers—Galileo has taken
              the lead in converting regular cars to bi—fuel cars. It has seen a 50
              per cent increase in demand since last November.</p>
              <p>Gilbert von der
              Aue, sales manager at C. Melchers, said: "We started last November in
              this workshop. Ever since then, we’ve done 400 cars. We convert 80 cars
              per month currently, and from next month onwards we’ll be doing 120
              cars. We have a waiting list of about six months."</p>
              <p>The initial
              outlay cost to convert a regular car is almost S$4,000. But in the long
              term, it will cost less to own a bi—fuel car.</p>
              <p>"CNG is so much
              cheaper than petrol. It’s about a third the cost of petrol. So I would
              save about 70 per cent if I drive on CNG instead of driving on petrol.
              On top of that, CNG runs cleaner so I don’t have to do an oil change as
              often as I would if I had a petrol or diesel engine."</p>
              <p>"It makes
              sense financially. You just have to pay one time but you save the
              environment. That’s the whole reason for it," said a member of the
              public.</p>
              <p>"If it’s safe, if it’s more economical, why not?" said another.</p>
              <p>C.
              Melchers said it is targeting middle— to lower—income Singaporeans
              because they are the ones who will benefit the most from cost savings.</p>
              <p>But when it comes to cars, cost is definitely not the only consideration.</p>
              <p>"For
              me, I prefer performance cars. It’s great to save the world but I
              didn’t get this car for nothing. I won’t be converting soon," said a
              member of the public who drives a sports car.</p>
              <p>But more may change
              their minds as petrol prices get higher. Currently, a litre of
              95—octane unleaded petrol costs about S$2.08, but a kilogram of CNG is
              only between S$1.18 and S$1.24.</p>
              <p>However, not everyone is swayed
              because right now there are only two stations accessible to the public
              on mainland Singapore — one at Jalan Buroh in Jurong and the other at
              Mandai Road in the north.</p>
              <p>Three more stations will be ready by the end of this year at Jalan Bukit Merah, Bedok and Serangoon North. — CNA/ac</p>

              <p>unknown_X- yes you may be right to use diesel but not many cars are running diesel at present. as for hybrid -not sure went the battery can last and also it expensive to have a change or replacement of battery after the cycle is up.</p>
              <p>well as for cng- it think there some grey areas that need to look at.  our home cooking gas the hoses and the valve is a must that need to replace every 5 years worry. so what about cng.</p>
              <p>so i think, have to wait and see wat next? as they may say it safe but how safe is it.</p>

              <p>That's my opinion on our environmentally 'friendly' cars. You
              may not agree with all of my points, but I am still entitled to

              <h1 class="clr">Boom in CNG car sales seen in Singapore</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Companies selling cars fuelled by Compressed Natural Gas, or CNG, are seeing a boom in sales.</p>
              <p>Rising petrol prices and the Green Tax Rebate are driving motorists to switch.</p>
              <p>"Just
              six months ago we (sold) an average of 190 cars a month, of which only
              20 to 30 per cent are CNG cars. Today we (sell) about 250 cars a month,
              out of which 70 per cent are CNG cars," said Valerie Tan, managing
              director of Pinnacle Motors.</p>
              <p>Many customers have been lured by
              cheaper fuel bills and the Green Tax Rebate, which gives them a 40 per
              cent discount off the car’s Open Market Value.</p>
              <p>One such person is Melvin Toh, whose budget has been increased when he bought a new CNG car earlier this year.</p>
              <p>The
              bachelor, who drives approximately 700 kilometres a week, rarely uses
              the boot, so the space taken up by the CNG tank is not a problem.</p>
              <p>However, Toh, who lives in Toa Payoh, has to drive to Mandai Link every two to three days to fill up with CNG.</p>
              <p>There
              are currently two CNG stations accessible to the public on mainland
              Singapore — one at Jalan Buroh in Jurong and the other in Mandai Link
              in the north. A third is operating on Jurong Island.</p>
              <p>"Of course
              it is a bit inaccessible, but I still feel that because I want to
              reduce my transport costs it’s still worth it," said Toh.</p>
              <p>The
              Automobile Association of Singapore advises motorists to take into
              consideration the travelling time required to the three refuelling
              stations in Singapore, and the ease of refuelling in order to maximise
              their cost and fuel savings.</p>
              <p>The association said it receives
              regular enquiries from its members about the installation of CNG
              technology. It will be holding a CNG Conversion Workshop on July 26,
              but due to strong demand, a second workshop will be added.</p>
              <p>A third CNG refuelling station will be ready in Serangoon North by February 2009.</p>
              <p>Sembcorp
              Gas, which runs the Jalan Buroh station in Jurong, said demand there
              has exceeded expectations. And the company is looking for other
              suitable locations.</p>
              <p>Despite it being more inconvenient for CNG car owners to fuel up, significant savings have been found.</p>
              <p>To
              fuel a 1.5 litre car to drive 200 kilometres, it will cost about
              S$11.50 using CNG, based on the current pump price at Jalan Buroh,
              compared to S$34.20 before discount if a 95 Octane petrol is used.</p>
              <p>With a saving of S$22.70, the real question should be how much time and effort is one truly prepared to spend to go green? —CNA/os</p>

              <p>Petrol prices shot up and converting to CNG becomes an attractive option. Now the converts are crying foul. After spending so much money to convert their petrol cars to CNG, they are now at the mercy of the CNG suppliers. With only two points, maybe more later, it is a MONOPOLY!<br><br>CNG price has shot up by 25% in 3 months from $1.28 per kg to $1.59. And prices of CNG were not affected like the speculation in oil. Producer price of CNG was stable during the whole duration.</p>

              <p>Price have really increased to 1.59 but only at mandai. The one at jalan buroh is cheaper.</p>

              <p><br>There are many factors to consider.</p>
              <p>1) One more CNG cylinder = weight of one more person.</p>
              <p>2) One more cylinder = not much place to put luggages.</p>
              <p>3) CNG Gas is not halfprice of petrol. In fact, price of CNG gas is about 1.59 currently while fuel is 2.134 (station discount, not counting credit card discount). Thats 75% of the price of petrol.</p>
              <p>4) Not enough CNG gas station. You probably have to travel a lot more distance just to pump CNG.</p>
              <p>5) conversion may void the car's warranty, and could result in a slight drop in power.</p>
              <p>6) If your car is not originally fitted with CNG cylinder, you may have to open your car boot everytime you require to regas. Imagine having to open the boot everytime and people can peek into what you put and even steal things from there?</p>
              <p>7) Upgrading to hybrid is not cheap (at around 4k).</p>
              <p>7) Lastly, one litre of CNG gas may not last as long as one litre of 95 grade petrol.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span class="newsTitle">More cars being retrofitted with CNG</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>More private cars were fitted with Compressed Natural Gas or CNG kits last month compared to the first five months of this year.</p>
              <p>Cars fitted with such kits can run on both petrol and natural gas.</p>
              <p>Latest figures from the Land Transport Authority show that there are just over 1,000 such bi-fuel cars on the road last month.</p>
              <p>This is a jump of nearly 300 from the month of May, and four times as many compared to the whole of last year.</p>
              <p>The rate of increase of CNG cars also outpaces that of hybrids which run on petrol and electricity.</p>
              <p>While an average of 100 hybrid cars were added to the roads every month from January to June this year,</p>
              <p>bi-fuel car additions rose from an initial average of 50 to later 200 then 300 last month.</p>
              <p>Yet both these car types represent but 0.5 percent of the total private car population here, which now stands at 530,000.</p>
              <p>The figures are borne out by CNG retrofitting companies like C
              Melchers, which are seeing a backlog of customer requests and have
              hired more manpower to keep up with conversion demands.</p>
              <p>They say demand is set to rise when two more CNG refuelling stations
              are built later this year, in addition to the current three.</p>
              <p>But with natural gas prices rising in tandem with petrol increases,
              as well as CNG's diminishing supply from its growing popularity,</p>
              <p>Environment Economist Tomoki Fujii feels natural gas is not the best alternative to oil in the long-term.</p>
              <p>So while it makes sense for buses and taxis to run on CNG, for
              private car owners, the Singapore Management University Assistant
              Professor feels the best way to go green is still to use less petrol
              whenever possible.</p>
              <p>"For the average commuters it takes a long time to get back the
              returns even if the price of oil continues to rise faster than CNG so
              it still makes sense to use ordinary cars, this includes cars like
              hybrids and cars that operate on gasoline." --938Live</p>
