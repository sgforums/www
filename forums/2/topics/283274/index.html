            <div class='col-md body'>Don't you guy find it damn irritating when people just cut in front of you and the distance between you and his car is merely centimetres? I mean if you are in front the car behind should allow you to go thru first instead of trying to overtake on the merging lane itself.<br><br>KNNBCCB, last saturday, 29th Sep at ECP (city) exit from Bedok (near east coast park there) got this CB lexus, I think its GS300 or what did such a thing to me. I was in front of that Fcuker at the slip road exit where the lanes merge. I couldn't go further forward as got another car on the right merging lane directly in front of me. I was on the left merging lane. This Fcuker was chionging and despite the nose of his car behind mine, die die must cut in front of me in the merging lane. Damn forced me to almost have to swerve to the road shoulder as that mother Fcuker came damn close to me. A$$hole was lucky as my folks were in the car at that time or I would have attempted a chase on him. A$$hole think he is Alonso on the Belgian grand prix and I'm Hamilton and try to force me off the road.<br><br>Seriously, don't let me see you on the road when I'm driving solo man. I don't give a flying Fcuk whether that time it was you, the mother Fcuking driver who was responsible for almost pushing me to the road shoulder or someone else. I'll give him as much hell as I possibly can. Or if I see your car parked at some carpark and I have the time, I'll wait there till you come back and give you a piece of my mind. Fcuking A$$hole. U Fcuking think you rich you own the Fcuking road is it? Tell you you Fcuking ah siah, you whole day only drive auto cars give you my car you probably can't even drive your pathetic self out of the carpark I tell you.<br><br>Really, I hope you get into some accident that does not cause any injury or fatality someday lah. Its through this then people like you will learn to respect the road and the other users. Hope you smash your bonnet or something. And hope even more that I'm there to see it. Then I'll stop my car, get down, walk over to you and tell you serve you right. Then give the Nelson laugh.</div>

Well I let him in by slowing down. But what happened next ? The vehicle infront of him do an Ebrake and he can't stop in time. The rest you guys should know since you ppl here are so pro in driving.<br><br>An advise : If you can give way then give him the way. If you can't that only means he will have no chance to squeeze infront of you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes if it is courteous to give way, like allowing a driver to filter out from a road obstacle in front (eg. accident or Purposely Want to Dig aka PWD public works department at work), I will give way as far as possible. But not all the time one must give way. Its like you cannot always let others walk all over you. We must give and take and not always only "give" while those a$$hole drivers keep "taking" from us.<br><br>Anyway I drive a typical 1.6 L jap car only. If both of us bang, chances are that I might crash into the barrier on the side of the road. If alone perhaps I will go head to head with the Lexus Fcuker but I was with my parents at that time so have to safety first.<br><br>Dunno if you guys feel the same. I feel that everytime some luxury car drives recklessly and inconsiderably towards me, be it Lexus, Mercedes or BMW, it always happens on weekends. Is it because weekends always those ah siah kiahs from those FcukSh!t ACS or Raffles school alumni drive their parents car and think they damn big Fcuk? Just a possible reason that I can think of.<br><br>And yes, I can agree with you guys that ranting here is almost as good as futile. But at least there may still be a glimmer of hope that other "think they are F1 drivers" drivers or reckless drivers in luxury cars will read this post and know that there are people out there who do not fear their wealth and would dare to spit in their face if they try to be funny.</div>
