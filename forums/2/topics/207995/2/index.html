            <div class='col-md body'><br>frankly speaking, singaporeans are generally very <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>poor and weak </strong></span>in their driving and steering wheel control. On our roads, you don't see many drivers signalling when making a turn or changing lanes, this is because most singaporeans are actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not skilful enough </strong></span>to signal, check mirrors and turn their steering wheel at the same time in one movement and at high speed, shame on these people who have difficulty signalling, To put it bluntly, these bunch of pathetic poor drivers are either having problems with their hand coordinations and steering wheel control, or are extremely poor in road navigation and indecisive on which route to use. This handicapped phenomena is apparent <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">among speedsters and inexperienced taxi drivers</span></strong> who are not able to signal when they are speeding. These bunch of drivers whose skills and techniques are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">below average </span></strong>should go and enrol for driving refresher's course and polish up their god damn driving skills.</div>
