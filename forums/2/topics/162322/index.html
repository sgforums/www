If you sound proof your car, you're just covering up the noise.<br><br>ie. Rectification (if possible) instead of cover-up.<br><br>You're right - lets give our business to those who deserve it, instead of some rude idiot who expect potential customers to beg them for their services.  Tan Chong or any good workshop should be able to test drive your car and provide further advise....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i thought sound proofing is getting common these days?<br>It is not that some parts are damaged that are causing the sounds. Higher cost vehicles have better sound proofing done on their rides as compared to lower costs vehicles. So by sound proofing, we are just creating a similar acoustic environment as those of higher cost cars. I don't feel it is making the ride more dangerous. No one complain a lexus is dangerous to drive even though its interior is damn quiet. Am i right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, most certainly, some cars are better insulated than others. I am sure Tuff Clad is not the only shop dealing with sound proofing. Most hi fi shops or dealers do it as well but at what cost? Look at the classified today, it has a good list of them. For road noises, you may think about sound proofing at the wheel wells etc. But it will add weight to your car.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sister, there is no such thing as 100% sound proof. 20-30 % is already v reasonable.

Different parts of the car, different effect. If you are talking about road noise, changing a nice set of comfort tyres might be more practical.<br><br>Aftermarket sound proof have their limits and would never be able to achieve what branded car can. Few reasons involve, window glasses, extensive sound proofing coupled with sound damping, shielding for gaps to reduce wind noise, ......etc.<br><br>Lastly, most people do aftermarket sound proofing for ICE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
