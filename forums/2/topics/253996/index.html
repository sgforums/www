            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saturday May 12, 2:17 PM</span></span><br><br>SINGAPORE : The Consumers Association of Singapore says the car industry is among the top three businesses receiving the most complaints for the past three years, besides timeshare and contractors.<br><br>CASE receives an average of 1,426 complaints about the car industry every year.<br><br>Most complaints are about problems in getting car loans approved.<br><br>Some car buyers also tell Channel NewsAsia about their bad experience with parallel importers, or PIs.<br><br>They choose to get their cars from PIs hoping to get different models and at lower prices.<br><br>But some consumers end up with late delivery and poor after-sale service.<br><br>One said, the parallel importer failed to deliver his car, `three times over three months'.<br><br>What's worse, the buyer felt threatened when the agent told him "I know where you stay and work, so be careful".<br><br>Another told Channel NewsAsia he was asked for a S$2,000 compensation when he cancelled his contract after months of waiting.<br><br>He was also told that he had to forfeit the deposit of S$3,000 he had placed for his car.<br><br>The buyer said eventually he did not have to pay the compensation but lost his deposit.<br><br>Another buyer told Channel NewsAsia that having booked his car in January, he had put down a deposit.<br><br>He was promised delivery before the Chinese New Year but till today, the buyer is still waiting.<br><br>So a new organisation is aiming to change that bad image.<br><br>It is called Symbol That Assures Reliability and Trust, or START, and it wants to regulate parallel importers.<br><br>It is asking parallel importers who sign the contractual agreements to follow guidelines.<br><br>Melvin Lee, Founder, START, said: "Those dealers who want to become START members, they will have to give certain commitments like a banker's guarantee, and to sign a draft agreement from the lawyers to make sure that they are of the same mindset to provide the services according to our guidelines."<br><br>We asked Vin Cars, which says most of its customers are happy with its service, what it thought about being regulated by guidelines.<br><br>Mike Teo, Senior Manager, Finance and Administration, Vin Cars, said: "It should clear up the misconceptions of the public in the view of the wrong ideas about parallel importers. So I think it should work."<br><br>And if START members break the guidelines provided?<br><br>"If they break these guidelines, action will be taken against them and we will remove them as members straight away and announce it to the public," said Mr Teo.<br><br>Even so, START admits it can't do much for customers who have fallen victim to unscrupulous parallel importers.<br><br>So the aims are noble but the challenge is to get more PI's to follow the guidelines that can help clean up their image. - CNA/ch</div>
