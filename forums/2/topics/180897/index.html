            <div class='col-md body'>Went to take a second look at my Sales Agreement which states that the estimated delivery is from May to July. The SE said that my car will arrive in the mid June shipment as I have indicated for black fabric interior (there was no black fabric interior last year). Starting to wonder if that has an effect. Also, if my car's shipment is only in mid June then why did it state May?! Could it be that someone decided to forgo his car/colour and I end up in the front queue?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by canaan:</div><div class="quote_body">Anyone know why insurance for lancer is more expensive than other similar range cars?<br><br>Also, regarding "car feels light and soft", what is the downside effect to this?  How much lighter is it compared to the Altis, Sunny, etc?  And would there be any safety issues on this point?</div></blockquote>Want to know why the insurance so ex? simple.. go see how much does the spare part cost. For e.g the front bumper.... I juzz changed one and the cost of the bumper itself is around 350. You can get a toyota or honda for around 200-250. If it is the sport version. The body kit is damn ex. side skirt with dam cost around 300 if i remembered. Overall, I would say mitsubishi parts are damn ex. That may be the factor which casue the insurance to be so ex.<br><br>Car feels light? it will be...especially when u drive fast. went JB run, hit a small bump on the road at 180 and you can feel the car lift off from the ground. My fren estimated it to be 2 inch.LOLz... When touchdown and you can feel the tyre and suspension down...Ouch! But I find that when lancer is used for hard turning or cornering, you can really feel the butt trying to fly out alot compare to sunny.<br><br>One nice thing about lancer is the interior, the design of the dash board and a/c vent are juz nice in position. It makes it look kinda neat. The leather seat has a better feel than a corolla due to its design. (I felt backache when driving a corolla)<br><br>Dislike: The leg space for driver is not wide enough. My left leg is always leanng against thr center. (Maybe I like to open my leg wide...ball ball too big...lolz)<br>Sohc engine roar like a lion on high rpm.F/C at high Rpm is not good.(below my expectation)Woodland checkpoint to Genting, 75% tank at min 130km/h (took 4 1/2 hrs 2pit stop) But the power for uphill is not bad, made it to genting top with ease.(considering it a 1.6)<br><br>*sob* *sob* now lancer at w/s at sin ming...hai~~ sad manzz.. 2 weeks no see the car already.... stupid CC still dun deliver the door to the w/s.  Miss the car already.</div>
