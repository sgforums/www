            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys .. newbie driver here. need some advice. today at bout 5.30pm .. i had an accident while turning into bugis junction. this is what happened... i signalled left, and my lane was a go straight/turn left lane(lane 3). then i slowed down and i saw that the left turn i was going to make is leading to the loading/unloading bay... so i slowed down even more(all the while leaving my signal on). not wanting to hold up traffic, (traffic condition was pretty heavy), i decided to make the left turn first and think bout anything else later. suddenly a lorry came from the second lane(lane 2) and cut into my lane, breaking the right lights and signal, (he was turning into the same turn i was turning and his lane was a go straight only lane). and he says its my fault !!!!! i feel its totally not my fault.. i feel its cos i p-plate that's y he want to eat me... dunno personal feeling. anyway, how now ??? both of us cant get into a mutual agreement... what should i do now ? please advise ... thanks....<br><br>p/s: the car isn't mine... third party insurance. his lorry no damage except for some rubber thing dropped out.</div>
