            <div class='col-md body'>well the city and vios are both 1.5 litre cars, and since i am a honda fan, i would most likely choose the city. but coz i more power hungry, in this scenario i would choose the vios. aiyah, now honda's vtec dunno y more and more disappointing... btw the impreza not bad too, with its awd system <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with those who say that the city looks awfully like a whale on pathetic small wheels... but i've seen it done up with bodykits n bigger wheels, n it seems a totally different car altogether. looks great to me, dunno if u agree.<br><br>also, the gearbox seems like a fun thing to meddle with...<br><br>http://asia.vtec.net/article/2003City2/<br><br>was initially quite impressed with the vios looks, but the flavour of it doesn't last... looks too tamed i guess.</div>
