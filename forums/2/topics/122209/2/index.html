            <div class='col-md body'>Airtrek like milo tin? U driven one b4 to comment on it? I personally quite like the comfort, and I'm talking from a level of comfort based on Merc cars. Handling and reliability? once again, the handling is pretty sporty, firm but not overly hard, and reliablity wise we've had no problems. what makes u think the passat is better in these areas? while I personally like VW cars quite a bit, u should know that the passat is described by car mags as being rather boring and devoid of any real feel. handling certainly is not better than the Airtrek.<br><br>Lets face it. u want a lively VW, go get the new Golf GTi. thats a gem of a car!<br>Alternatively, if space is not as big a consideration, a Renault Cliosport is a very rewarding car to drive as well.<br><br>By the way, the new Golf has the GTi in 5 door varient as well, but im not too sure if it's launched in Singapore yet.

            <div class='col-md body'>You laugh at the Porsche Cayenne for being High CG and cannot corner well....well, please go do some research....The Cayenne will beat the Airtrek Turbo flat out in cornering on stock springs. Cayenne Turbo, don't even come close at all....hahaha...<br>Its only those boy racers go and put Tein or aft market springs, then maybe can come close. But then again, Porsche has their motorsports parts as well. If you have check out some of the aft market parts for the Cayenne.<br><br>I am just telling you, no doubt the Airtrek is a fast car, but in terms of refinement and re-sale value, its not going to be good for you. The 2nd car markt is so saturated, went to Turf club city yesterday, man, dead town..<br><br>So, driving a VW Passat, at least, it gaurantees a certain re-sale value for you.<br>Can drive fast no use, TP everywhere....at least u drive a VW, the TP don't aim you that much....</div>

As for Mitsubishi, I already have enough of it. Yes it is a good car when it is new, try driving it for a couple of years and see if it is still the same car. Honestly if the car is lasting, I dont see why it fetch such a low resale value. If I remember correctly in USA Mitsubishi has one of the worst resale value, partly due to the company reputation of hiding technical fault and customers complains.<br><br>If I want to spend 100+K on a car, I would honestly go for a continental.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. I agreed with Gazelle's point of view. Mitsu are nice cars when new, but 5 years down the road, man, worse than a pick up....the workmanship all like shit....just take a look at a 3 yr old Lancer, you know the answer already.<br><br>But take a look at a 3 yr old VW or Auqi, totally different. ITs still as tight as when it was new. And engine wise, still as good as new if service properly.<br><br>Cheers Gazelle, for sharing an analysed thought with the numbnuts....</div>
