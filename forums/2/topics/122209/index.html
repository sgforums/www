            <div class='col-md body'>Get the new Passat. IT was developed with the same mentality and dedication as the Phaeton and Touareg. Very refined Euro cars...If you buy the Passat, you can rest assured that every cent of ur money is worth it. VW is changing their image and all their new cars are made to go head to head with the other German Marques.<br><br>If you can afford 100k for a car, why go for a Jap make. Firstly, a Jap make can never offer you the comfort of a Conti make and in terms of chassis refinement, the Conti cars beat the Jap makes flat down.<br>As for spare parts for VW, trust me, there are plenty of workshops that can service VW, Merc, BMW, etc..even Porsche can be serviced outside of Stuggart Autos.....<br><br>And you can get the 1.8T Passat, chip it, and friend, AirTrek Turbo, please, get out of the way....<br>I don't even understand why ppl buy that car, half hearted SUV and wanna be fast car. I think S,pore is the only 2nd place the Mitsu is selling it, other than Japan.<br></div>

Bass not heavy enough for my liking, otherwise the car is generally lovely. Only other grouse is the transmission. But hey I'm sure u could go do up the audio system for a bass heavy sound.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I just have my doubts about the reliabilty, only because of the cover-ups. If it doesn't bother you, go ahead and test it.</div>
