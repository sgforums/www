            <div class='col-md body'>well.. if ur talking about a 100k budget and a passat, it can't be the 1.8t eh? i think it would be the 2.0 passat instead.. here are the stats<br><br>Model: Volkswagen Passat 2.0<br>Engine: 1,984cc 8V in-line four<br>Max Power: 115bhp at 5,400rpm<br>Max Torque: 172Nm at 3,500rpm<br>Gearbox: 4-speed automatic<br>Top Speed: 193km/h<br>0-100 km/h: 12.4 seconds<br><br>note that this is the current model passat and not the new model passat which will be 2.0FSI and it will probably cost 130k to 140k(estimated)..<br><br>nothing really impressive with the 2.0 passat, just the vw brand imho.. might as well get a japanese make like the camry, cefiro, legacy, 6 or accord.. better value for money<br><br>i also believe that skoda cars are good in terms of their built and engine as they share lots of parts with vw.. just that the brand is not that established in singapore at the moment.. skoda was once a really crap car in the 80s and early 90s if im not wrong, so it's gonna take quite a bit of effort to bring rise to this brand.<br></div>
