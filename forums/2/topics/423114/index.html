              I've been driving for some time in Singapore. I'm sure all of us have at one point in time encountered irritating dangerous drivers. 
              
              I have come to the realisation that maybe they drive this way because they have lousy driving skills. 
              
              Thus the best way to beat the competition is driving below the "belt". Well done! 
              
              Here are my top 10 favourite observations. 
              
              1) The rich drivers - Typically black BMWs. Will only race cars less powerful than theirs. They might race another of the same make. But usually if they encounter a sports car, they will back off. 
              
              Verdict: Only know how to pick on weaker cars and rely on their car to compensate for their driving skills.
              
              2) Cutting into fast lanes without opening signal. I'm able to stick to traffic regulations and overtake cars myself.   
              
              Verdict: The element of surprise is the only way they know how to cut into the fast lane. 
              
              3) Driving dangerously fast to overtake you on straight roads and suddenly slow down to block you dangerously during a turn / cornering or worse, suddenly brake during those situations. 
              
              Verdict: A 3 year old kid can drive fast on a straight road. The real skill is in driving fast during a cornering or turn. I can do turns at 110km/h to overtake without resorting to dangerous blocking movers myself so I know it can be done.
              
              Please feel free to contribute to the list above. 
              
              And to all the "dangerous drivers" out there, dangerous driving does not equate to good driving skills. Drive responsibility and help save the lives of other drivers and your own lives. 
              
              If you think you are a pro start behaving like one and don't make them lose face. If you think you have what it takes, go the Simpang circuit.........

              <h1 class="storyheadline">CJ sends a signal to young drivers</h1>
              <p>by Selina Lum</p>
              <p>PROBATIONARY driver who caused a fatal accident will now be barred 
              from taking the wheel for six years, not one, after a successful appeal 
              by prosecutors.</p>
              <p>Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, who extended the driving ban 
              on property agent Gabriel Lim Yong Han, 22, said on Thursday: 'I should 
              send a signal to young and inexperienced drivers that they should 
              exercise care when they drive... if they don't and cause a death, then 
              they should be disqualified for a long period.'</p>
              <p>Lim's probationary driving licence was just eight months old
               when he drove his father's lorry across a pair of white lines along 
              Braddell Road in December 2008, cutting into the path of a taxi in the 
              next lane and then hitting it.</p>
              <p>The collision at 1.50am on Dec 27 left the taxi's rear 
              passenger, accountant Tan Sheng Ping, 28, seriously injured. Ms Tan, who
               was not wearing a seat belt, died in hospital 1-1/2 hours later.</p>
              <p>Cabby Teo Cheng Liang, 41, also hurt, was given three days of medical leave.</p>
              <p>Last October, Lim pleaded guilty in a district court to 
              causing Ms Tan's death through negligence, and to injuring Mr Teo, also 
              through negligence.</p>

              You are obviously thick in the head.
              
              Mentioning words such as "race", "skill", "element of surprise" and "dangerous blocking movers(??)" goes to show how dense you are. 
              
              First of all I agree that the 3 types of people you mentioned a bunch of idiots but that does not make you any better. Although it is comforting to know that at least you can identify dangerous behavior.
              
              Driving on the roads is a form of commute and not a race so stop imagining that you are in any sort of a racing situation. Anyone can do turns at 110km/h, there is nothing to boast about being able to step on the pedal and turning the wheel. It is not as if you can fry an egg, do a blackflip and sing the national anthem backwards while turning at 110km/h. You know why people don't make turns at 110km/h? Because its dangerous for the people crossing the roads and driving around you, not because you are special.
              
              Hence if you are so obsessed about car racing, get a life and do it on the race track where you can try "stick to traffic regulations and overtake cars myself". On the roads no one gives a damn about your so called techniques and skill. People just want to get to their destination safely. Get your shithead off the road

              <p>You are short of ONE extremely dangerous type :</p>
              <p>1) The zombie drivers – Sudden drop in speed or unresponsible brake on roads because of sudden wish to make a left/right turn, U-turn or another lane leading to different destinations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Verdict: Majority are woman drivers who knowingly or unknowingly think they are the only driver on roads.</p>
              <p>PS: I not biased toward woman drivers as my above comments are based on several  observations.</p>
