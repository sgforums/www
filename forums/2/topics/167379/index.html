Having chatted with many taxi drivers before, it seems like they are always worried about having to cover rental costs and all that. Doesn't help either that they are constantly on the road, subject to rude passengers and yada yada yada. Definitely increases their stress levels. The taxi companies should be the ones to do more to alleviate these problems, namely, by providing some basic pay at least, plus some incentives.</div>
