              <p>Not neccesarily true. The price gap has closed considerably, and no, the specs of the car is not the same. Do take note that PI can give you lower price not because they cut into their profit margin, but because of the tricks they have to lower the OMV of the car, hence less tax = lower paper value for you, the owner.</p>
              <p>Things like solar flim, sound system, leather seats, etc are all installed locally. Quality wise, unless you're getting from high end PIs such as Richburg who specialises in Toyota, quality wise will not be on par with the real MIJ - Factoy Fitted deal that KM ships in directly. PI cars are shipped in from Japan are all 'bare minumum' to lower OMV as low as possible. Sure when you buy from KM the price is a bit higher, but if there are problems/product recalls, at least you know you're safely covered.</p>
              <p>Then again, its your money and hence your choice, but I do agree that KM sales have very rigid price packages, then again most of the things you'll ask for (floor mat, solar, leather) are already included in the price, not like other places where the base price is really bare minimum and you have to work your way up through expensive options.</p>

              <p>My advise is ...Get the stream from AD, the price diff between PI is only 4K at most and it does not come with sunroof, I got mine at less than 74 k 2 weeks ago...</p>
              <p>AD also offer solar film and leather seat not the good one though which the PI can match</p>
              <p>In addition AD OMV is also higher than PI, Have not got my car , but according to SE it should be around 28 K ... I doubt PI can match.. that means you stand to get about 15K back when you scrap your car 10 year later !!!</p>
              <p>So my RSZ yearly depreaciation is only 6K !! Even less if you register as a weekend car</p>

If you want peace of mind, buy from AD. If you like haggling for a better deal, go to a reputable PI. At the end of the day, you have to do your own homework.</p></div>

              <p>Haha.. tell me about overpriced. Back in 2004, I paid like 80k for Honda Jazz 1.4 i-dsi with COE 26k.</p>
              <p>Now they are selling for like 53k for the new i-vtec model with the same CC but COE less than 3k based on last few biddings.</p>
              <p>If you are comparing legacy 2.0A with 1.5A Jazz, the OMV is about 20k for both models. So I would say the pricing is fair.</p>

              <p>Haha.. tell me about overpriced. Back in 2004, I paid like 80k for Honda Jazz 1.4 i-dsi with COE 26k.</p>
              <p>Now they are selling for like 53k for the new i-vtec model with the same CC but COE less than 3k based on last few biddings.</p>
              <p>If you are comparing legacy 2.0A with 1.5A Jazz, the OMV is about 20k for both models. So I would say the pricing is fair.</p>

              <p>Pricing may sound fair, but the difference will surface once you pay for the car's other related expenses.</p>
              <p>Road tax, petrol and insurance will be wide margins apart. Well, at least Honda cars have a relatively high resale value because of its high OMV.</p>
              <p>But still, it sounds scary paying $80k for a Jazz if that period comes back... :(</p>
