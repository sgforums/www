              <p>4justice, from the way you speak it's pretty obvious you are the kid behind the screen. n0x here is well respected in the forums and post decent stuff. You are nothing but just a trouble maker. Can't even differentiate between a Vios and Altis. Disgrace to you.</p>

              <p>If it ain't a performance car, please don't bother. If you went out in public dressed like an idiot, people are going to think you're one. If you dress your car up like an idiot, why shouldn't people be allowed to say you're one?</p>
              <p>If anybody want to do it, have some balls and take the criticism for doing something daft and poseurish. If they can't hack it, simple solution. Don't do it.</p>

              <p>I'm sorry, did I spout nonsense? Saying that a racing vios is poseur, pointless, and stupid is hardly nonsense. If I said "hey that toyota looks good in that kit" now, THAT'd be nonsense <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm sorry but I couldn't care less if people r offended that I think the altis n vios are shit. Good for you if you use it as it's intended: as a means of transport. Bad for you if you think you're the next takumi fujishite.</p>
              <p>And yes, EVERYONE's shit smells. Your logic simply continues to amaze me. If someone as off their rocker as you  is "well respected in the forums" as FocusST so laughably said, its no wonder the truely respectable lao jiaos like Chris, William and others have abandoned this forums.</p>

Sports rims with a 155/70 R13 tyre is not going to fool anybody into thinking theres any sort of sporting credentials, or indeed, even any sort of aesthetic appeal to it.</p>

Or perhaps you don't dare because you realised that you've made a claim without knowing it to be true? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>Go on. Show that you're not empty words. Take the bet up. If you don't than you've effectively admitted you don't know me and just shot your mouth off. And in that case, if respect for n0x comes from people like you, it says a lot about him really.</p>

              <p><br>I personally don't think small metal rims look bad. At least they don't look pretentious like those ones. It's like a very fat man decked out in the latest football outfit. Nobody is going to think he's a footballer. Sports rims with a 155/70 R13 tyre is not going to fool anybody into thinking theres any sort of sporting credentials, or indeed, even any sort of aesthetic appeal to it.</p>

              <p><br>how sure are you that the fat man can't play football? sometimes juz cos people put fat tyres on sport rims doesent mean its a lousy tasteless piece of crap. sometimes it could be for ride comfort what. skinnier tyres = harsher ride. so fatter ones are softer. not everyone wants to sacrifice comfort for juz looks of skinny tyres.</p>

              <p>no seriously. Look at the pic of that vios again and tell me those are sports rims. with a straight face. seriously.</p>
              <p>you gotta be kidding me right? if you don't want to sacrifice comfort why the fuck would u even put on those pretentious rims? Won't the stock steel rims with the hubcabs do just fine? They certainly look no worse than the ones that'd been put on! Those wheels are so small that the wannabe "sports rims" just look wrong. Why pay more to look worse?</p>

              <p>A poseur is a poseur is a poseur. Nobody I know thinks those rims are lovely, except for the people who delude themselves into thinking its "lovely" because they can't afford the real deal. I have more respect for people who understand that a toyota Altis or Vios is a fairly reliable and value-for-money workhorse and everyday runabout. I respect people who want something nice, can't afford it, and simply say "ok, I'll work for one, and not try to pass something off as something else it isn't" and finally I respect the people who own the real deal.</p>
              <p>What I don't respect is people who are wannabes, settle for less, try to pass it off as something it isn't, are delusional enough that they think it makes them cool, and then expect to be respected for it. Just doesn't happen. I'll be nice to people who deserve it, I'll be less indifferent to people who don't do stupid things.</p>

              <p>Is true that some of the regular posters, normalboi, tailslide, so_nice etc, seems to have vanished. I used to be able to chat with gentlerock as well, for those old enough to know who he was. The truth is sgforums has by and large been dominated by ginnas, and flaming has been the ingrained culture here already. Even the clones have degraded in standard, boi86 and boi85 threads were some of the most followed up and exciting threads. Then came the invasion of the china-car supporters led by pionner hellomotosxq, and latest was WHATODO, but even he has disappeared.</p>
              <p>But i OT.  In fact any one looking for performance wont even bother to look up toyota. simply because cars sold by borneo is never associated with performance cars.</p>
              <p>And for those who sincerely believe in the Altis Racing or Vios Racing editions..well.. all i can say is, please do not bother to turn up at pasir gudang or sepang. just dont bother.</p>
