              <p>You can tell by their design etc. If it's not fitted on the car, try lifting the rim and see how much it weighs. A good sports rim would be lighter than you expect from it's size. Failing that, talk to people who actually know their stuff, and they'll point out real sports rims to you.</p>

              <p>Is true that some of the regular posters, normalboi, tailslide, so_nice etc, seems to have vanished. I used to be able to chat with gentlerock as well, for those old enough to know who he was. The truth is sgforums has by and large been dominated by ginnas, and flaming has been the ingrained culture here already. Even the clones have degraded in standard, boi86 and boi85 threads were some of the most followed up and exciting threads. Then came the invasion of the china-car supporters led by pionner hellomotosxq, and latest was WHATODO, but even he has disappeared.</p>
              <p>But i OT.  In fact any one looking for performance wont even bother to look up toyota. simply because cars sold by borneo is never associated with performance cars.</p>
              <p>And for those who sincerely believe in the Altis Racing or Vios Racing editions..well.. all i can say is, please do not bother to turn up at pasir gudang or sepang. just dont bother.</p>

              <p>Ah yes tailslide and normal_boi. Lol I could probably get tailslide to come vouch for me if those silly people accusing me of being a kid want. Ah well, nightsky87 you're very perspective. Thank you for taking the time to point out the obvious to those clueless people. Like I said, I'm hardly surprised that the really respectable people like tailslide, william, chris, normal_boi etc are gone.</p>

              <p>so this is BM's way of trying to win back more market share....</p>

              <p>all this are nothing but marketing spin, this edition and that. for cars that cost so much in singapore, any differentiation that will give you an edge will be tried on. cars here are not commodity. they need all the frills they can get, even  in names. just like honda odc absolute edition from kah motor....lol</p>
              <p>racing edition is just a name. surely none of us is fool enuf to think that this is modded to be `race ready'?</p>

              <p>Last I checked, I'm not the only one who thinks its cock. What have I sidestepped apart from the fact that you're being pedantic for the sake of it? My words and comments are spot on, as many others seem to think so, my logic is spot on too. I mean, if you don't like to be called a cock, don't do something cock-ish. How is that warped?</p>
              <p>Lets put it this way. Whatever coming out of me is going to be more constructive than someone like you who stay on to claim the scraps of "respectability" After the REAL respectable people like chris, tailslide, william etc have long gone. At least I don't lord over some pathetic leftover crumbs and play big fish in a small pond.</p>
              <p>Like I said, if you want me to I can get some of the lao jiaos to come in and tell you whose argument is rapidly degrading, but if you wish to get to that point you better be prepared for some major embaressment and eat humble pie. Now who do u want me to get? Tailslide? Chris? Tell me, who do u want to deal you the fatal blow? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Seems you haven't changed much even after 4 years, Sam. You really want me to get Tailslide to come and tell it to you huh? Remember who couldn't handle a debate with good ol Tail and said he was tired, but is too proud and insisted ah Tail is also tired? Tsk tsk tsk <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> And no I'm not ah Tail before you jump to conclusions.</p>
