That is quite a decent FC. What did you do to your Car?<br><br>I do believe Lancer have much better handling than Vios due to the wider wheel base. If it wasn't for the rumored weaker FC, Lancer would be a much better choice than Vios. However that applies for the manual car only.<br><br>I am not into Auto cars, but believe City (Auto) to be quite strong a competition.</div>

Am not saying that the Made in Thailand Vios have no problem but all depends on wat you are looking for leh and yr luck too.<br>from fuel economy, engine, model age, performance, must said that Vios is slightly better than Lancer lah in tat cateogory.

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm currently driving a 1 mth old Lancer Sports Manual. Dunno how you guys managed to get FC around 15km/l. Must have some super secret fuel saving driving method. For me, the best I've managed is 14.3, but on the average, I hit about 13.4km/l, which I'm quite happy with.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>The following are just MY opinion:<br><br>LANCER (Pros)<br>1) Spacious interior<br>2) Good FC<br><br>LANCER (Cons)<br>1) Recent PR hoo-ha (i dun really care)<br>2) uses 4-year-old technology (GLX)<br><br>VIOS (Pros)<br>1) Speedy pickup/acceleration<br>2) New modern technology (VVTi)<br>3) Probably higher resale value<br><br>VIOS (Cons)<br>1) Cramped back space (i mean, very cramped)<br><br>Vios is good if you're driving alone, or with 1 front passenger most of the time. Quick pick-up, sporty, lots of aftermarket stuff etc. But if you need to ferry friends, family etc and use the back seats very often, you'll have to seriously consider the mild "discomfort" of the cramped rear.<br><br>Eventually, I picked the Lancer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi wbucket,<br><br>Yes, I average out 15.5km/l... the key is:<br><br>Do not step hard on your accelerator when you move off or while cruising. BE GENTLE on the accelerator! Keep to 80-90kmph while on the expressway. At night, if it's cool, like these few days, turn off aircon and drive.<br><br>I got the 16.5km/l when I did not turn on the aircon and drove to and from school. Traffic was smooth that week (think it's sec school holidays) and it was cruising all the way.<br><br>I DO agree that the Lancer has bigger legroom than the VIOS. and it's 100% more spacious than VIOS. in my opinion, the design of the Lancer (sports version) is nicer too.<br><br>Joe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It all depend on your feel to the car. I was so determined to buy Vios three weeks ago but my girlfriend suggest that i should shop around more. So happend that we stepped into Mitshbishi show room and the moment i take a close look at the car i start to have second thought. I feel that the body and interior is more comparable to Altis then Vios, at least the door does not feel so light.
