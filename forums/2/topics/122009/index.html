My friends are engineers too. We worked in many field, although none have been in automotive industry, (Singapore don't have, for guads at least.) I do have a friend who worked in aero-space. All industry is similar. If you have friends involved with production of automotive, please share his experiences. Assumption is a dangerous tool.<br><br>As for the set of rule, I don't know about other model, but I have a friend who drive a Vios. You should know Vios club is about the biggest club in Singapore. There are members who researched and came-up with a set of guideline to run-in Vios. Maybe you can check it out. very detail one.<br><br>Don't know about bikes, cause never research on them.<br><br>*****************************************************************<br><br><span style="color: blue;">it my practice to post all PM to me for dun know what reason.</span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">don't feel that it is benefitial to the thread-starter</span></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> if a point is made it sure does is benefitial to the thread-starter.<br><br>i dun have friends involved with production of automotive at all and i myself had mention i never do any run in for my new car/s or even new bike/s.<br><br>one more point, please read the link you gave me, it on bike and it call break-in and not run in.</div>

Go for another 3000km than change to your semi or fully SYTHETIC oil. for me i used semi as full sythetic is a waste of $$$, we dun face low tempreture as in 10 and blow.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Change Your Oil Right Away !!<br>The best thing you can do for your engine is to change your oil and filter after the first 20 miles. Most of the wearing in process happens immediately, creating a lot of metal in the oil. Plus, the amount of leftover machining chips and other crud left behind in the manufacturing process is simply amazing !! You want to flush that stuff out before it gets recycled and embedded in the transmission gears, and oil pump etc...<br><br>Why do the manufacturers recommend waiting until 600 miles to<br>flush out all the loose metal ???<br><br>This is a good question ...<br><br>3 more words on break- in:<br>NO SYNTHETIC OIL !!<br><br>Use Valvoline, Halvoline, or similar 10 w 40 Petroleum Car Oil for at least<br>2 full days of hard racing or 1,500 miles of street riding / driving.<br>After that use your favorite brand of oil. </span></div>

And that web is provided by another poster, and it also states that it is for car engine too.<br><br>Unless I have mistaken these 2 words to be the same, I still think there is a need to run-in/break-in your engine. I have an issue of "Torque" magzine that advises on the run-in practice, if you want I can scan it and email to you.<br><br>I still think this is not benefitial to the thread-starter. Didn't you notice it seem like only the 2 of us is arguing now?<br><br>If you are sore because I said that you are schooling, then I apologise. I didn't mean it as an insult. But seriously, those QA QC stuff is really not that reliable. Have you heard of a passenger plane flying, when the mechanic lose 1 of his tools. I think you should have heard stories about a whole factory shut down because 1 screwdriver is not accounted for. So flying when that mechanic couldn't find his tool is a very serious thing whereby safety is very important. Any, it was found after the plane landed, in a place where a serious banking of the plane could move that tool to a position that could cause some serious damage.<br><br>Have you been in a production line before? You know how tiring it is to repeat a certain step in the production for 6 hours with a 5mins break in between? QA and QC only ensure that inspection is carried out, and checks are done periodically. Of course thing like jamming piston isn't going to happen, engine with slight deflects that compromises engine efficiency could still leak out into the market.<br><br>2 different point here. 1 is the un-reliable QA and QC. The other is the need to Run-in/Break-in. Both points are not related, cause run-in/break-in isn't to counter the deflects from production.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>while im not taking sides in this argument, i would like to state from a racing point of view that it can be very misleading to take proceedures carried out on racing cars and compare or use them in the context of road going vehicles. The main reason being that the emphasis on road-going cars and on racing cars is different. Racing car's ultimately focus on performance while road-going cars focus on longevity. As famed Lotus man Colin Chapman once said, the perfect racing car(back in an era where there was no 2-race engine rule) is the one which falls apart after crossing the finishing line.</div>
