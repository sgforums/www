            <div class='col-md body'>(2nd idea on this topic)<br><br>Supposing that we(especially ladies) may be transformed to "agressive character" as soon as we hold steering wheel, so this issue may be related with rather psychology than law/regulation.<br><br>we may define "vehicle group" that a number of cars are travelling as a group. there can be many reason how the vehicle group was fomationed, the main reason can be cars on innermost lane are travelling horizontally or same speed with cars on outer lanes. But we may not call it as "vehicle group" which was caused by heavy traffic and appears a few Kilometers long during rush(?) hour.<br><br>Let say, defensive driving, we need some safty zone to avoide accident upon facing unavoidable situation. this safty zone can be formed when there is empty lane on the road. If someone argue they are travelling on innermost lane to stop others from travelling at higher speed, eventually this may increase the maginal danger of their own let alone others.<br><br>it's the safest way to travel by myself on whole road which is very unlikely situation. Then some hypothesis are,<br>- We are travelling with others<br>- travelling at low speed on inner most lane will increase the level of danger to a vehicle group<br><br>Then proper practice will be,<br>- do not block and let it go on if any car wants to overtake my own<br>- Travel on the proper lane based on the speed you need/want to perform<br>as this will relax the danger factor on the road not only my own but my own vehichle group<br><br>Supposing that we are driving under very heavy rain, all the cars around us will be great threat regardless speed we travel. As we experience, the danger is not from speeding at innermost lane but from sudden braking/speed-up/changing lane within my own vehicle group.<br><br>so we may conclude that if i travel by myself on innermost lane at high speed, i'm the only one in danger. But if i block all the stream of cars on innermost lane, danger will be equally distributed to a vehicle group.</div>
