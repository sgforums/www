Is Lane 1 on an expressway designated as an overtaking lane ? and that only on lane 1, you can overtake other vehicles ?<br>[b]There is no specific legislation stipulating that the rightmost lane is only for overtaking.</strong><br><br>2. When one drives on Lane 1 on an expressway at the speed limit of 90Kmph, can one be booked for road hogging - assuming he is not blocking a emergency vehicle ?<br><br><strong>Whether travelling on on the rightmost lane within speed limit constitutes road hogging is circumstantial. Motorists travelling at or near the speed limit are generally not deemed to be road hogging.</strong><br><br>3. If you overtake another vehicle on lane 2, using lane 1, are you allowed to exceed the speed limit in the process ?<br><br><strong>Driving beyond the speed limit to overtake a vehicle is clearly a speeding<br>offence.</strong><br><br>As these issues are common misunderstandings that might lead to large<br>groups of drivers to unknowingly break the traffic acts, we hope you can<br>spare us a bit of your attention and time.<br><br>Thanking you in advance<br>Law abiding citizen<br><br>Look, what's there to argue abt. these are replies from TP. don't talk abt your friends in TP telling u this and that[/b]</blockquote>EDGAR!!!!! where have u been!!!??? u only show uo when there are topics like this. have u nothing better to offer the motoring community other than ur "overwhelming" knowledge on the subject matter? do u eat nothing more than plain rice and drink nothing else than plain water every single day of ur life?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
