            <div class='col-md body'>I was wondering, does everyone really knows about when to give way when cars are rushing from behind at the outer most right lane. Actually those driving @ 90km/h should give way to the cars rushing behind. The road sign put, " Keep left unless over taking". But sad to say, I find that alot of driver dun give way at all. If durng peak hour, it is understandable. But during off peak when its not really that pack, some can drive slowly on outer most lane @ 70!!!. What are those guys thinking.<br><br>One of the most common road sign on the way expressway is, " Keep left unless overtaking" but with some of the drivers who keep on sticking at the outer most right lane not budging, how are the cars behind gonna overtake. Overtake on the divider??<br><br>I was wondering, how many people really knows about this "keep left unless overtaking" thingy and really knows about the meaning. If people want to speed, juzz give way let them overtake and speed. Kenna caught speeding would be their problem. Although the sign says speed limit 90, we drivers do not have the authority to say who are speeding. Only TPs and LTA are the one who have the authority.<br><br>In conclusion, if you are not going faster then the vehicle behind you, give way and let the behind vehicle overtake. Dun have the mindcept of thinking that..."Hey, I am going at 90km/h already, why you behind speed so fast for what" Juzz move your car butt and give way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have checked with my friend in TP. HE says as long as you are blocking the car behind you, you are road hoggin him despite whatever speed u are. Especially in the right lane. So even if you are 140km/hr and he 150km/hr, you are still road hogging. So both of you caught speeding + you get extra charge on road hogging.<br><br>It is normal for cars to exceed 90km/hr to overtake, in fact TP gives 10km allowance for that. So please be considerate and act as if you own the right lane. Here's to more considerate drivers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As what one of the reply stated, Keep Left Unless Overtaking. Even if anyone is driving at the max speed limit of 90km/h, you will still need to give way or it will be taken as you are road hogging. Whether the behind car is speeding or not, its not up to individual driver to comment or think or even to decide. Its up to TP or LTA to decide as they are the one who are given the authority to do so under Singapore Traffic Law.<br><br>And so, the moral of these topic is.... please let your frens who are drivers take note of this.<br><br>It is true, as long as if you are on the outer right lane tavelling at a speed slower than the car at the back, and no space of overtaking on the right is applicable, you will be considered as road hogging.<br><br>Majority of the drivers knows that during off peak time, on the highway, alot of cars do travel at 110km/h. If the front driver still mantain at 90km/h and no space to overtake on the right, it will be road hog.</div>
