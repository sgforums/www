His TP fren is correct and he did not mosinterpret his words.  Few years back, TP has a campain catching Road Hoggers.  One lady was fined for road hogging and TV crew intervied her on the spot.. know wat she say? "I travelling at 80km/h wat.. i did not know i road hogging.. bla bla" (that time speedlimit on the expressway is still 80km/h) So typical..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>BTW, if anydriver dares to drive at 200km/h in SG.. yes.. u need to give way to him!  Its up to the TP to go catch him! And if you like to play TP, you can go police station log a written report against him.  Police will charge him.. and you can go play witness in court.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually hor, I have one question to ask. How do you all define the word "overtake"? Does it mean that as long as you can go faster than the car in front of you, you are elligible to overtake him? If that's the case, if im going at 200 on the expressway, then i dont think i need to return to the left lane leh, cos i can overtake everyone else mah, and if everyone else doesnt want to be a road hogger, they cannot come into the right lane and hog my lane... cos i am the fastest... i can overtake everyone else....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't understand why it is so difficult to comprehend the whole idea of driving in Singapore.<br><br>Driving is just 1 part of the transport system, and in Sg, it is normally perceived as the option to take if u want to be quick. The expressway is further perceived to be the EXPRESS option compared to other trunk roads. Therefore, it is rational to assume that motorists on Expressways are ppl who prefer quick transit.<br><br>Using Expressways is not about who drives faster than who. It's about express  transit, and I don't see why others should be bothered about my speed as long as I drive responsibility. If others can't hack it, dun travel on Lane 1. Lane 1 is not the only lane on the Expressway, and Expressways are not the only option to get from Pt A to Pt B.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br></div>
