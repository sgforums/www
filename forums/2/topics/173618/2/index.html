            <div class='col-md body'>i, almost met  incident with a comfort taxi, yesterday morning at ECP. The taxi was signaling to turn to Bedok from ECP. I was travelling at 80km/h at the rear of him. He suddenly change his route and cut back to the ECP to east coast and slow down to the speed of 60km/h and i have to brake and slow the speed. Time 0700hrs.<br>From my view, he look sleepy as he was drive like he road belong to him and swing from centre lane to left lanes most of the time undecide which lane he want to keep in-line. After 1 minutes of following, I horm him at him, as i  can see my rear mirror that  vehicles are jammed up on the  centre lanes. He(the taxi-driver ) didnot respond. Have to lookout and swing to the outer lane and overtake him. All the other vehicles too follow the overtaking. When pass a few metres ahead and look back,found that the taxi still "BOH Cha' keeeping on the centre lane at 60km/h.<br>Have taken down  his number but wat can we do? His company is not going to take action? As we need witness.<br>It is best to install CCTV to it and take down the incident moment than submit to the press rather than to the company.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, frankly i think you should write in and complain.<br>My sincere apologies to some people whose parents or close relatives are<br>cabbies, but in most general, most cabbies are bastards, with huge egos<br>that shape their reckless driving styles.<br><br>Especially on fast lanes, and at occassions when you need to overtake or cut them. They simply turn on their 'bastard' mentality and race you in order that you are always on the losing end to them.<br>They also do not realise that playing games like these are completely immature<br>and stupid where the concept of bread and butter is concerned.<br>I can't wait to see some of them irresponsible ones lose their license and see what tougher life awaits them.<br><br>So, dont feel bad, just send your complains in and let the authorities handle them!<br><br></div>
