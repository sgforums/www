              <p>Hi all.</p>
              <p>I intend to take up driving lessons and get a class 3 licence without the next few months. However, I know absolutely nothing about driving and taking lessons. Did some quick search on google but still have some queries:</p>
              <p>1) For Basic Driving Theory as well as Final Theory, are we suppose to study on our own (using the books) or must we take theory lessons? Should I study the theory first and take the exams on my own before I contact the school/private instructor?</p>
              <p>2) A Provisional Driving Licence is needed before we can take practical lessons on the main road, however, can I start practicing in circuit before I even pass my FTT? It still boils down to when should I start getting a instructor: before, during or after the BTT and FTT?</p>
              <p>3) School or private? What's the difference?</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>1) for BTT and FTT, you can study from your own books and take the test. Whether you sign up through the driving school or go as a private candidate, there is no need to take theory lessons. I recommend you just pay the $5.65 fee to take the<strong> trial test. </strong>That would be sufficient. Theory lessons are mainly for foreigners who do not understand the language in the books. You MUST, at the very least, clear your BTT before you can apply for a PDL to take practical lessons, regardless of driving school or private candidate.</p>
              <p>2) No, you will not even be allowed on the circuit if you do not have a valid PDL. If you ask me, you should start sourcing for a good private instructor then contact him for lessons <strong>after</strong> you pass your BTT. <strong>Book your FTT right after you pass your BTT</strong>. Normally it takes quite some time until your FTT date. In between, you can continue taking practical lessons.</p>
              <p>3) Unless you are an extremely slow learner, go for private. That being said, ask around your relatives and friends to recommend a good private instructor to you. School allows you to clear lessons very quickly and religiously in a nice environment, but it comes at a steep cost. I spent close to $1800 for school and got my license within 5 months (failed the 1st test), whereas private will perhaps not even overshoot $1200, but might take longer. Not worth the money I guess.</p>

              <p>1) you stay anywhere near bbdc? if so, go for theory with them, they're really good in theory, prac not bad as well, only negative point is the pricing.</p>
              <p>2) YES, you're allowed to drive/learn in the circuit even before you pass your btt. PDL is only needed when you drive outside/public roads. Circuit requires nothing at all. but normally pdi would require you to have a PDL because as a private, you're normally on the main road, unlike sch students. even for your first lesson, you'll be out.</p>
              <p>3) school expensive, but learn things stages by stages, unlike private, where i've heard some pdi just teach what they can think of for that lesson. up to personal preference though, for me, i prefer sch.</p>
