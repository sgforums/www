            <div class='col-md body'>On the 11th of April 2006 at around 5:30 pm, I visited Esso Frankel Petrol Station to fill up petrol for my car. The car was filled up by the pump attendant. Once done, I proceed to fetch my daughter from the child care. At the child care, I noticed there is a curve scratch about 15cm long in between the rear passenger door and the fuel cover. I was sure it was scratch by the pump nozzle as before entering the petrol station, it was my habit to check the entire car everytime before leaving my work place and I found no scratch whatsoever on my car body. The petrol station was my next stop.<br><br>I went back to the petrol station to clarify with the pump attendant. Upon seeing me alight from my car, he just looked away avoiding an eye contact. When I approached him to enquire about the scratch, he became defensive and agitated.<br><br>As the manager was not around, I leave my contact number with the cashier. The manager called me around 8:00pm the same day asking me to come down the next day to try to work out on a settlement.<br><br>The following day, I went back to the petrol station. Just as I suspected, they use intimidation by outnumbered me 3 to 1. At the scene present were the manager and the two bosses of the petrol station (thatÂ’s what the manager told me as they did not introduce or identify themselves). I was speaking to the manager when one of the bosses interrupts us. The boss just gave a quick look at the scratch and shouted, yes shouted, that the scratch was not cause by their pump and walk away. In other words, he treats me like an idiot just because I drove a Korean car. Wonder if he gave the same attitude if I drove a BMW.<br><br>The manager that spoke to me tried to negotiate with me as IÂ’ve already made up my mind to bring the attention to their higher authority. The manager assured me that even though I blow up the matter, it will still be cover up as the manager explained that one of the bosses had already sent out an email to their general manager who assured them that the general manager will take the blame if my complain were to reach their higher authority. In the manager view it will be pointless for me to complain as they do not looked into complain seriously. The manager then promised me that he will split 50-50 the cost for respray explaining that he does not want a bad record and the pump attendant to be punish whatsoever.<br><br>After I have found a few quotations, trying to get the lowest quote as possible, the manager just told me he will not be paying as he was already transferred to a new Esso petrol station at Chua Chu Kang and he got nothing more to do with it. He even mocked at me through the telephone to carry on with my complain.<br><br>So, on my experience on the above event, are Esso petrol station owners low educated person as they did not know how to handle a situation professionally, are rude and snobbish in their behaviour? Are Esso managers love to make empty promises? Are Esso employees taught not to apologise  if mistake were made?<br><br>Finally, is this how Exxonmobil train their staffs?<br><br></div>
