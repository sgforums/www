It's a Daewoo Nubira and if I recall correctly, the reviews were okay, but they complained of the high pricing compared to other cars in its class.<br>Perhaps they were trying to compete in the Japanese 1.6l market here initially, and now the pricing is comparable to a Korean sedan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>The finishing of the interior is well done  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are right about the service (born mot). If you want good service, drag along the family and best a baby.

            <div class='col-md body'>Right Bro,<br><br>Hopefully u will heed my advice, wat i've seen are total bullshits.<br><br>Budgetwise, U could get the toyota corolla, but lemme warn u first, servicing or maintenance with B Motors gonna be a long wait. With so many toyotas around, earliest 2 mths in advanced bah.<br><br>Honda Civic, top for these 3, but the 80k base is quite ex for a 1.6L. The lancer should be a gd choice, right smack in between the 2. Go get the sports version, u wont be disappointed.<br><br>If u want a coupe, get the hyndai Tuscani, with arf down, one would costs onli $78,000. Killer looks, 2000cc, 2 doors, cheaper then honda.<br><br>Go for the coupe!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Black_Ace, you mentioned with the ARF down a coupe would cost abt $78000. Can i know how you calculate or where did you get the info from? I am really shocked that with the reduce in ARF it will result in such a great price difference. Does the amount applies to all brands???? Thanks a lot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello bro,<br><br>I was shocked too, apparently was a authorized dealer by komoco motors.<br><br>The standard 1997cc coupe was going at $78,888. Monthly works out at $821.<br><br>If I have known this, i would had gotten the coupe than the new Lancer Sports (m) ($73,000).<br><br>God damm it, the mercs and bmws too, will take cuts up to $10,000!!!<br><br>Not to worry, PAP damm sneaky, COE will soar, in the end, not much difference.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ha......yeah now the tricky part is the COE. Papers said for the first two bidding, it will shoot up and those who rush will regret. I am thinking if they were to report in this manner then all will wait in the end the first two bidding will go down then subsequently it will rise sky high when ppl see that it is low. Please correct me if i am wrong. Need your view on this COE matter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think govt. also want to ensure that increase in COE price and no. of car owners on road to be gradual. So with this report, buyers are urged to wait out and not rush in to cause a huge surge.</div>
