            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>I'm new to this forum and wonder if I could get some advice from some of you who are more experienced in cars. I'm thinking of getting either a new Lancer or a corolla 1.5 or a civic vti. Civic is slightly more expensive and further more there is a significant powercut from the previous model thus I might want to root that option out unless you guys think otherwise.<br><br>As for Corolla, there are no more 1.6 left. My question is whether there's a big difference in terms of performance between 1.5 and 1.6 (anyone drives 1.5 corolla?) and whether is it ok to get a corolla 1.5?<br><br>For Lancer, I think the sports edition one looks nice but I have no idea about the performance, durability, maintenance cost etc. Generally, is it true that a toyota corolla outruns a lancer? Would appreciate it if someone can help me make a more informed choice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my friend,<br><br>lancer sucks. Can never consider it. You cannot buy a mit car if it is less than 2000cc. Cos Galant is good....but lancer sucks. Used old technology engine, GLXi. This is a 95 engine used in the previous 2 model.<br><br>Honda is still very powerful and very good. It seems that the new engine, VTec-I is more fuel economy than Toyota Corolla. I am driving Corolla but I advice you to buy a Honda if you can cos the next batch of Corolla will be make in Thailand instead of Japan.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo pal,<br><br>Thanks for the reply. I went to Kah Motors the other day and the attitude of the SE sucks totally. There were saying they got no more stocks and there will be a new facelift (slightly changing the front lights and bumper area) and that will cost $2000 more. When asked if I could see how it looks like, she say she doesn't have any and told me to try the website, i searched the SG, US website and saw nothing.<br><br>Furthermore, if I am not wrong, honda cut civic vti's power to 110 hp now which is considerably lower than the previous vti models. That means a probably lower performance + higher insurance. I tried the Mit lancer sports and (in my opinion) torque wasn't there and a lot of wind noise from the interior. Tested corolla and however seems muchhhhhhh quieter and a little bit more torque. Chances is I might go for a corolla 1.5 since they got no more 1.6 but then again they got this new altis coming and I really wonder how it compares to the japan made in terms of quality and features. (and which one to go for heh)<br><br>Just my 2 cents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>peace and cheers dudes!</div>

Last I heard they got some 1.5 xli stock left. The rest will be coming in from thailand (1.6 and 1.8 1st week of december or so) and they will be called Altis.
