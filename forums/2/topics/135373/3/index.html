There are very very few due to insurance policy...<br><br>i would say is better to go for car sharing as i calculated but then, there are several people in this forum would disagree...<br><br>So you have to do the comparision yourself according to your own needs and make the judgement call yourself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

You pay for how long you use + mileage charges, not to mention the annual fee and joining fee that you have already incurred. Renting you need to rent the car for a min of 24 hours.<br><br>The decision that you make should be from a basis of the following factors:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How often (nt so impt) and how long (more impt) you want to drive per rental or sharing.<br>(one day, few hrs, few days)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How much are you willing to pay each time for time behind the wheel<br>(Note that sharing might not be cheaper even you use the car for lesser time)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How much distance that you think you might cover for the rental / sharing?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Are you willing / Can you fork out a sum of money of a few hundred dollars to pay for the membership, joining and p plate fee to drive<br><br>In sum, car sharing's convenience and flexiblity comes with a cost that may put rental company into a favourable territory depending on how you orientate your priorities.<br><br>I agree with pqr that no many car rental companies rent their car to p plate due to insurance considerations. But not to forget that there are private rental who are willing to rent a car to you (it's legal only on weekends and PH). You will need to ensure that the contract drawn does not put you in a disadvantage position.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cityspeed sucks!!! I have complained to them at least three times about dents &amp; scratches on car and missing petrol tank caps, both over phone as well as in writing.  So far nothing has been done! They are so particular about even returning car late by a minute! They slap you with a $50 fine!<br><br>Enough said....I've just signed up with Carcoop. Much newer and well maintained cars. Even had my registration fee waived and got myself a Creative MP3 player for signing up with credit card  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> !

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand that many with Cityspeed are quite frustrated with cityspeed and want to cancel the membership.<br><br>I recently ask how to cancel mine too and this is how it goes.<br><br>I send them (support side: support@cityspeed.com.sg) a mail on my intention to cancel due to under-ultilisation of their service and within a few days, I got a reply from them saying that request is duly informed and I will get back my refundable deposit thru Giro. Quite a simple process.</div>
