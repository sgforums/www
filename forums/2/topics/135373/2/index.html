U can call them up and ask any of their sales staff for more details, dun be put off by the current rates they have on their website  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>cheers</div>

If you live in town, might want to consider Honda ICVS car sharing. The competitive edge it has over the rest of the car sharing is that you can pick up a car from one location and return it at another.</div>
