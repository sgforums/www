            <div class='col-md body'>Hiya Guys, as I just got my license(auto) in April, I signed up with CitySpeed to get some driving experience before I decide to buy a new car. So far no complaints after I've used their cars about 10 times. Only downside is that sometimes when u pick up the car, the exterior is a bit dirty and most of the cars have scratches on the car body. Other than these points, the performace and handling is okie.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Any forumers here have any comments on CitySpeed Carsharing?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

They have probably factored that into the price of renting the car to you and the milage which they charged you at 40 cent per km. For vios, let just put it this way, for every tank that you pump for them, (in terms on mileage charge), they would have collected enough money to pump 3 more tanks.<br><br>So enjoy flooring the pedal....that's the advantage over car rental that I can think of for car sharing....<br><br>And despite me pondering on how to make full use of the dear $0.40 per km mileage charge other than drag race at traffic lights, i came to the conclusion that there's simply no way that this $0.40 per km is cheaper than if I pump petrol myself...</div>

Few hrs of free usage I felt is insufficient.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes, I am still with Cityspeed, membership expiring coming July. I will probably not renew my membership too for reason very similar to yours, in addition to the fact that<br><br>1)I am not ultilising often...think drove less than 10 time the last year with them...<br><br>2) I still not comfortable with the fact the I am paying 3 time more the mileage charge than I would paying for petrol (being a person who would cover quite a distance each time I have a car.)<br>Meantime, will stick to car rental now as I can arrange everything that needs to be done to one or two days (hopefully)<br><br>Also, may consider Whizzcar after looking at their range of car. Just wonder how's their car condition and waiting for an offer tempting enough for me to join...But the mileage charge is stopping me from entering into another car sharing membership...Why not they let us top us petrol ourselves and stop charging us for mileage!!! It's the mileage that's making the sharing very expensive...</div>

To save the trouble, I just use blue-tack...<br><br>As for your question, no, if it is continuously, it is considered one booking, means you take the car from friday and return on tuesday, no need to start and end 2 times. The system will recognise. Just check that your end date / time is tuesday and your specific end time and not Mon morning.</div>

I rather incur only the fixed cost (of $100) rather than incurring the fixed cost and incurring progressive more variable cost (the additional cost you pay for driving, mileages, etc)<br><br>One week drive once for car sharing is quite a lot already.<br></div>
