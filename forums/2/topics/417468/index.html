              <p>THE current certificate of entitlement (COE) system is not working as 
              it should because it has been hijacked by car dealers.</p>
              <p>They have found it worthwhile to control the bidding system 
              to their advantage. Let me explain:</p>
              <p>Suppose a car dealer offers an all-inclusive price of 
              $130,000 for a car. Included in this is an allowance of $40,000 for the 
              COE, and the dealer ensures it does not exceed this budget.</p>
              <p>If the dealer gets the COE for $35,000, it makes an extra 
              $5,000 margin on the sale; there is no refund to the buyer as the 
              agreement is that the COE price will have to drop much lower for a 
              refund to kick in. If the premium goes above $40,000, the buyers are 
              told to top up.</p>
              <p>Thus, the dealers are in a win-win position, and that is why
               they are so eager to bid on behalf of buyers. The system as it 
              currently is, is unfair to buyers, but it remains so for their 'bidding 
              convenience'.</p>
              <p>Doing away with dealer bidding will make a big difference. 
              Currently, if a buyer bids for a COE himself and gets it, the dealer 
              offers a different package that is disadvantageous to him. This will 
              stop once dealers cannot bid any more.</p>
              <p>Higher COE premiums will impact taxi fares too, which will 
              increase sooner or later to cover increased rental costs due to the 
              higher capital cost of taxi firms.</p>

              <p>Never really tot of it this way but it makes a valid point.</p>
              <p>Maybe the solution is to get buyers to buy their own COE. No more middlemen. Car dealers just sell cars. Full stop.</p>
              <p>As
               long as you have checks in place so a buyer is limited to buying 1 COE 
              within a given period and cannot easily transfer (so they can't 
              speculate and buy and sell at a higher rate), maybe this will work&gt;</p>

              <p>For the current situation,</p>
              <p>if you got your own COE, car dealers will DEFINITELY (or most of them) will sell you a car. Because the quota is so little now, even if the dealers bid for their customers, might not be able to secure any COE also. So, they will sell you a car to clear their inventory. It's expensive to hold on to inventory..</p>

              <p>in Hong Kong you need to get a parking lot quota before buying a car...</p>
              <p>The reason e quota is cut drastically because the whole mess blew in front of their face.</p>
              <p>You sure they're not scared abt e cost of traffic jam? All these not $$ to them if you claim it's revenue generating engine.</p>
              <p>Might as well you go on say why 30c per lit petrol tax? Since you're so good in conspiracy theory.</p>
              <p>Also the road tax increment seems you've no idea. Back then no such thing of $874 per year. It only goes up and not down.</p>
              <p>The whole idea is you use car, I tax you and e $$ is to be spent on MRT. As if the money came from e sky</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You don't have to buy a carpark lot just to buy a car, buying a carpark lot is for investment purposes. Where the owner of the lot can rent it out to a car owner to get returns. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>$70k COE is because they cut the quantity of COE supplied by more than half. If you know Economics 101, a reduction in supply with demand held constant will drive up prices. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

Don't start with you this conspiracy theory and that conspiracy theory, have figures to substantiate your argument and not build your argument on air. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
