            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I'm driving the IS now. Was fighting against myself to keep the civic or get a new IS.<br><br>End up i get an IS cos of the power and reasonable price.  Its a fun car, except that the build quality is nowhere close to the civic. haha......<br><br>My advise, if you got 2 small kids, dun get a hatchback. Its always a case of being safe. Touch wood, but if someone bang you from behind, at least if you are driving a sedan, there's a boot to protect yr family.<br><br>I got no kids yet thus i choose to 'play' with the IS for the moment. Prepared to drive for at least 5 yrs, then might change. And i personally do believe that the 'mod-bility' of the IS is much more than the Getz/<br><br>I have not test drove the Getz 1.6 2dr, cos i did not even consider it in the 1st place (no offence to Getz owners out there) as I'm in sales. And a Jap car will definitely be a safer bet between the two.<br><br>And yes, if a 1l swift can last ten yrs, why not a IS? Just my personal views.<br><br>Hope it helps, cheers~!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...if u were to ask me, it's gonna be an IS anytime. but considering the fact that you haf a family and 2 kids, it would be better if u look at cars wif more space. perhaps suzuki liana hatch back? it has space &amp; decent power.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Between the 2, it would be ignis sport. Cause both are 3 door hatch, I would guess it would be harder a choice if you are considering a 4/5 door door with a 3 door car. Much inconvenience to get a 3dr car when you have a family.<br><br>However, I do agreed on the alternative choice of YRV turbo. At least it is a 5dr hatch. Auto car would be a little minus point, but maybe your wife would be happy with it.<br><br>Conclusion: IS anytime. You are paying more for a reason. Only choose the cheaper car if you don't know what you are paying for, or it isn't worth paying for.</div>
