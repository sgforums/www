(where the prices and COE are sky high compared to now)<br><br>2) you will be paying for the sky high price of diseal for taxis and busses.<br><br>when i tried shell 92.my vehicle suffered backfiring.<br><br>so lan lan stick to RON 95<br><br>to me, i think they are using 2 different petrol. my ex-collegues (all mazda fans) swear by mobil.<br><br>one is more power, but more noise. the other is less power, less noise.<br><br>to me, both damn noisy.<br><br>as for SPC, RON 95 was at 1.444 / liter plus 15% damn cheap lor. and I find that it's ok leh.. not as bad as most pple say. but don't expect VPower performance hor.... that one dunno put steriods in the petrol.<br><br>they have 92, 95 and premium 98 lor... the norm in SGP kiosks lar....<br><br>maybe i shld try their premium one day.... before the price goes up. hahaha<br><br>alo. u think i toking about 1-2 yrs time ar?<br><br>want to bet bo? 20 yrs time. when SG roads are congested again, COE prices will be at least double today's price.<br><br>by that time , your $2000 road tax will confirm be less than what you will be paying for your insurance.<br><br>as for petrol.... by then u can continue wishing that it is still $1.60 for Shell V Power ok?<br><br>Last time police man wear shorts, desiel at 25 cents / liter. now how much?<br><br>do u think price will go back? u wish hor.<br><br>and i like my car btw. even if i sell it, i won't suffer coz COE depreciation is fixed, unlike the market value of the car.<br><br>u can continue wish that COE price will drop like computer parts hor... good luck<br><br>bro, visit their SPC again. they have 95 for sometime liao.... esp those BP renovated ones.<br><br>at least the SPC in jurong east ave 1, bedok/siglap have RON95.<br><br>also a couple that i came along the way in macpherson...<br><br>maybe those stations that don't have 95 is rare now... (or u damn suay lor. hehe)<br><br>and if u view the sourcecode of the page u will see when the page was last updated.<br><br>yep.<br>u can get the sticker for +5% ontop of signboard. if u dun have OCBC.<br><br>i am currently going to check out Mobil 15% ... coz i got feeling Citibank ESSO privi card got additional 2% rebate.<br><br>haiz.. noisy engine oso bo bian... money talks.... maybe put ear plugs or turn radio up lor..<br><br>lol.. lets bet how long before your fav fleet of SBS will up fare prices by 10 cents 'in-view of higher oil market prices, so as to maintain competitivenss in the transport market."<br><br>those who don't own cars and take public transports who say they are 'immune' to these market forces are either dumb or clueless about world economics.<br><br>no lar.... more power coz u psychologically feel cheap petrol can floor accelerator mah... thats why more power.<br><br>i find myself doing more than 4000RPM on gear 1 whenever I am on SPC..... den on VPower.. i guai guai go 2000RPM .... too expensive cannot burn off too much.. sim tiah..<br><br>actually. if u think in the long run.. SPC still gives you better mileage... why? Coz the savings are more wat... u may pump more petrol per trip than shell.. but at the prices shell is giving... *faints*<br><br>pickup ar? u mean diesel? u can forget it lar... road tax for your diesel engine is SIX times your current one. (dun believe go check onemotoring).<br><br>that alone can let you top up your normal unleaded petrol until your hands shake from handling the pump too many times.<br><br>prices for diesel still not cheap hor... ask any taxi driver... it's about 80cents/liter.<br><br>we are essentially screwed over.<br><br><strong>THEN ALL THESE LEH?! CRAP HUH!?</strong><br>hahahaha....<br>Enjoy ur ride.. Vrrrrooooomm!<br><br></div>
