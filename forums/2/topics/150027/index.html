            <div class='col-md body'>i think that its nt the ebrake problem that cause the accident. for mi the sign place way b4 their construction has always given mi enough time and clearance to signal and filter out to the middle lane in a safe manner... its is always this drivers who are so kaisu wan to b in e front 1st and drv faster than usual and juz cut or squeeze into the little gap hopfully the driver behind will slow dwn or brake for them... in the end there is other cars infront mah... wat is their problem? u don save time by juz cuttin afew cars <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> totally brain-ness... i hav seen alot of cars always like to rd hog whenever they travel on the right lane, althought there is a speed limit but they r drivers who usually travel faster than speed limit and cum so near to them still don wan to move to the middle lane to let us pass when the middle lane is clear of cars. hav to let us do the extreme to cut them fr the left haizz... y cant ppl make drivin a less stressful one...</div>
