Now i guess u are saying you are right and the whole world is wrong? Ever occured to u there might be a misprint in the manual? Now you should go do your homework, surf for ITR sites online, and open your eyes wider n see for yourself. Of course u can continue to be egostical and think you are right and the whole world is wrong. I don't have to convince you btw.

This is not going to earn u good grades in an essay. The fact is that it does follow the comparism of a CTR, ITR and the REX by explaining why and how a car which may be heavier, and lower powered can be faster than a lighter and less powerful one. And u did claim that: "defying the laws of physics that a heavy car can outrun a lighter car with the same power lah........ you not making sense lah you." Apparently, this is not true because u have only considered 2 factors, power and weight. It does make sense, just  that maybe u are too ignorant of other factors which makes u think otherwise.

While I have no doubt the DC5 is fast, its not exactly shining. On track performance suffers due to the FF layout, and there have been many cases where it IS the last car in those Best Motoring races. The cars it loses to? S2000, EVO5, WRX, S15 etc. Now IF the DC5 was that shining, then it would at least be on par with the S15, but the problem is, the S15 and the S2000 both finished ahead of the DC5 by a lap or so. That does not speak of a "shining" performance. The difference between me and you is that you keep claiming that the DC5 is shining, thats blatant ball carrying beyond what its true ability is.

At least I can overwhelm you with facts.

I said that u must remember to consider all facts, and not just quote the bhp:weight ratio for justifying everything. Remember i never claimed the CTR is superior either, just that it may not neccessary be inferior, since while it might be heavier, and lower powered, the wheelbase is shorter(yes im still insisting it is shorter until u can conclusively prove otherwise), and the way the engine is mounted and such are different.<br>Remember that the Ford Focus RS is even faster around a circuit, so while both the RS and the ITR are FF, and the RS is 5bhp short of the ITR, it is somehow faster. U cannot use the bhp: weight ratio to explain why, since both cars have similar bhp:weight ratios, with the RS suffering more since its heavier. So i would like to see u explain why with your simple method of comparing weight and power only. Of course the answer is quite obvious, if u do think about the rest of the factors.<br>Just remember, I never stated with any certainty that the CTR IS superior.<br>If u will stop being angry because the car u drive is not as "shining" as u thought it was, and try to find some facts, im sure we can find a redeeming point for the DC5.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The difference between me and you is that you keep claiming that the DC5 is shining, thats blatant ball carrying beyond what its true ability is. </div></blockquote>but that doesn't make you any less of a mitsu balls carrier. face it like a man. platforms and performance, you have not stated a single FF NA car that can beat the DC5. there is no merit in comparing FR and AWD cars that are TCed with a NA FF car that didn't even come in last. remember, you and tofu were raving about the CTR and thats what sparked this thread in the first place.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">A RWD BMW 530i(1570kghttp://www.bmw.com/generic/com/en/products/automobiles/showroom/5series/sedan/index.html) can do 0-100 in 6.7 with 225bhp and 290Nm of torque @ 3500rpm. An Airtrek Turbo R(1520kghttp://www001.upp.so-net.ne.jp/hiro246/car/spec_cars_1.html) with 240bhp and 343Nm of torque @ 2500rpm, WITH 4WD , should, logically be doing the 0-100 in about 6 flat, so I can infer and use logic to prove my points, You, on the other hand, haven't really quoted many facts or examples other than some specs for comparing the CTR and ITR. At least I can overwhelm you with facts. U just sit there shouting that the ITR is good good good without explaining why u think so, in what way, or how u can, without taking us out for a ride, present facts which would enable us to infer from. </div></blockquote>you have managed to quote all these sites and you can't even quote the sites you got the 2616 mm wheelbase? you call that logic? self delusion on your part is over rated. whilst i am saying the DC5 is good, i never for once denounced the fact that there are cars that are better then it. i remind you that this is purely a discussion on the CTR vs ITR vs Rex and you keep bringing in other things, including the fictitious claim of different wheelbase. can u explain to me why should honda come out with an entirely different wheelbase for the EP3 and the DC5? please, dun take for granted your knowledge of other cars to equate your superiority in this arguement. and for the record, the i have never been overwhelmed by ur fictitious claims on the difference in wheelbase, and what does those links lead us in this discussion on the CTR vs ITR vs Rex? nowhere. stop over rating yourself before your head swells too large for its own good.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">Once again, go and surf and u'll see most sites claim 2616mm. explain why if u insist you are right. Of course they may be mistaken too but, why would so many sites be mistaken? and these sites are mostly ITR owner sites n such. </div></blockquote>so i dun own an ITR izit? or you telling me honda makes 2 different specs for the ITR? y dun u explain why YOU insist that you are right when you dun even own an ITR?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">I didn't say that the DC5 sure lose. I said that u must remember to consider all facts, and not just quote the bhp:weight ratio for justifying everything. Remember i never claimed the CTR is superior either, just that it may not neccessary be inferior, since while it might be heavier, and lower powered, the wheelbase is shorter(yes im still insisting it is shorter until u can conclusively prove otherwise), and the way the engine is mounted and such are different.<br>Remember that the Ford Focus RS is even faster around a circuit, so while both the RS and the ITR are FF, and the RS is 5bhp short of the ITR, it is somehow faster. U cannot use the bhp: weight ratio to explain why, since both cars have similar bhp:weight ratios, with the RS suffering more since its heavier. So i would like to see u explain why with your simple method of comparing weight and power only. Of course the answer is quite obvious, if u do think about the rest of the factors.<br>Just remember, I never stated with any certainty that the CTR IS superior.<br>If u will stop being angry because the car u drive is not as "shining" as u thought it was, and try to find some facts, im sure we can find a redeeming point for the DC5.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>i agree with you that bhp:weight ratio does not always equate a fast car. but bear in mind we are talking bout CIRCUIT racing. the bhp:power theory is always true in straightline races. The RS gets the advantage of the turbo, which should deliver enough torque to throw it around corners better, which is not surprising. and i do not want to go into that whole arguement of "anyone can drive in a straightline" thing. this is purely a point that the bhp:weight theory is subjective to the kind of race you are talking about. anger was not my motivation to go on with this discussion. the lack of justification for dicrimination is. this is not about redeeming the DC5 nor is it a thread to put down other cars. whilst it may not be as shining a car as others, it certainly is not the bad car that you guys are trying to make it look. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my most basic point is that i don't say its a bad car. I say its average. look back at my previous post.<br><br>As for a NA car, I can name one that has better power to weight and better power per litre than the ITR, although its not FF.<br><br>the sites i looked for was in my camp computer a few days b4 my latest post so i can't remember what the address are. as for my own website, i don't have a website. how about this. try to take a photo of the measurements, and the page in your book and show me?<br>btw, would the Acura DC5's specs and dimensions be the same as the Honad DC5? because quite some of the sites gave the specs for the Acura instead of the honda, although both are supposedly the same, there might be a difference which im not aware of.<br><br>finally, to be honest im getting bored by this discussion. we could argue the next 100 years and there would still be no conclusion. i wouldn't think the ITR is a great car while u wouldn't think its a lesser car so theres really no point in continuing. the truth is its probably lying somewhere just above "decent". U love your car i love my car, we both have the guts to stand up for what we like, so i guess we're actually..... similar... no point arguing anymore.<br>I'll just say again the ITR is not that great a car, although also not that bad a car. nothing more nothing less.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
