If u look at pure lap times.... u'll see the Radical put in osme astronomical lap times over everyone else. The reason they didn't win was because they had some ball bearing failure of some component which failed in the Sepang heat. Bearing in mind that this is e 1st year the BSA team is using radicals,and that the works honda team is highly experienced, i would put my money on the works honda team.</div></blockquote>i agree that some of these cars actually charged into the competition withour much prep. but the crux of the matter is that irregardless of the reasons that led to the failures, the DC5 outlasted the competition, most of whom, are cars that are so called "superior" to it. like i said, the class "A" cars come with minimal prep, so i dun see why the DC5 should even be discredited for its reliability in comparison with these "superior" cars.</div>
