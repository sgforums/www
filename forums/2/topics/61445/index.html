It looks decent and cheap, you cant do much in Singapore rite? How fast can you go, corners? I don't think anyone will buy a car and drift around corners in singapore, that piece of metal is just too costly.. If i were you, i rather get a sporty sedan.

So i'm waiting to get my skyline r34 gtr on dec 2004. when i'm close to ORDing. Any feedback on the skyline? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The VR4 club of UK clearly states 6 seconds. so no one should be eating no one for bfast. Though I admit there was a mistake. Should be 362Nm @ 4000 rpms... thats agreed... it was the 280bhp thats at 5500rpms.<br><a href="http://www.clubvr4.co.uk/info/specifications.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clubvr4.co.uk/info/specifications.php</a><br>[ Quick<br>- Spec ]<br>Layout -<br>Front-engined, 4wd, active differential<br>Dimensions -<br>L /W/H/WB:4680/1760/1420/2635mm<br>Engine -<br>V6, dohc, 4v/cyl, twin-turbo.<br>Capacity -<br>2498 c.c.<br>Power -<br>280 hp<br>Torque -<br>267 lbft<br>Transmission-<br><br>5 Speed Auto/Man<br>Suspensions-<br>All: multi-link<br>Tyres -<br>225/50 R16<br>Weight -<br>1520 kg<br>Top speed -<br>152 mph (claimed)<br>0-60 mph -<br>6.0 sec (estimated)<br><br>Another mistake. autoextreme quotes 343Nm @ 2500rpms. but its still not 3500rpms. don't forget car manufacturers like to be conservative on their quotes.<br><a href="http://www.xtreme-uk.net/AirTrekTurboROverview.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.xtreme-uk.net/AirTrekTurboROverview.asp</a><br>Engine: 4 cylinder, turbo charged 1997cc<br>BHP: 240bhp @ 5,500rpm<br>Torque: 253ft/lbs @ 2,500rpm<br>0-60mph: 6.0secs (est.)<br><br>At most what we have here is a matter of different sources with diff specs. I've seen Airtrek Turbo R Specs anywhere from 6 to 8.3 secs, and the VR4 specs anywhere from 6 to 9.6s... (oh i actually saw a video of a VR4 doing 0-100 in 9.6!!! either the driver didn't know jack about launching a car, or the VR4 IS really too heavy... dude had 2 turbos in his car too...)<br><br>I would prefer to think theres not much to choose from among these 2 cars because one is old one is new, but both are from Mitsuibishi which is a brand i really love. the 1st car i rode back home from e hospital was a Mitsuibishi Galant, 83 model, year i was born... i cried at 10 when it was time to be scraped. I have known the 3 diamonds for as long as i have lived. The fact is both ARE wonderful cars, but new technology is a step over old tech, or else it wouldn't be called new would it. Maybe when mitsu pushes out the next gen VR4, it would be even more awesome. for now, the ultimate fast mitsu would be the EVO series, and theres a reason for that, that reason which is sitting pretty under the Airtrek Turbo R's bonnet too.<br><br>i haven't seen anyone eating anyone 4 b'fast because people i know in Galants and Airtreks are much more civilised u see, n feel less of a need to prove anything.</div>
