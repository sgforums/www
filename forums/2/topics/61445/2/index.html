            <div class='col-md body'>true true.... well 5.9 is almost the same as 6 seconds... but the Airtrek is hampered by a lack of a manual box. Good thing about it is the EVO7 GTA transmission, which, well, means less hassle for daily driving, but u can't have toe heel fun...<br>What I guess i really love about it is the fact that it can carry a lot of stuff... fold the seats down and even my go-kart can fit in. OR my mountain bike. Fun...<br><br>Guess the Airtrek can't outrun a WRX though... never tried and don't think I will try. I'm happy as long as it can outsprint the Beng Bengs and their Integra Type Rs. I'll leave the battle against the scoobys to the EVOs... heck i know it IS faster than the subaru class equivalent: Forester.</div>

The cars were very well prepared, and the drivers were very experienced. The team as a whole was able to prepare the car and come up with a good plan n pace for the whole race. Some of the other teams were not so experienced, so it wasn't suprising that Team Meritus which is very experienced in Asian motorsports took the win. Hmm... whens the next race? I wanna actually go and take part in it... sounds like fun, I know because i've taken part in a 24 hours eudurance race b4. Emphasis is heavy on the drivers and on not pushing the machine too hard.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ouch.... honda loses it brakes....<br><br>The Crest Jaseri Porsche Racing team comprising Alex Yoong, Dato Mokhzani Mahathir and Faisal Hakimi had their bid to win the 2003 Merdeka Millenium Endurance 12 Hour race terminated in the final hour by a one-tonne Honda Civic "missile" when the Honda driven by Azman Hussin lost all brakes and tee-boned at more than 200 kph into the Porsche GT3 with Yoong at the wheel.<br><br>The incident happened at Turn 15 of Sepang International Circuit's longest back straight, only forty minutes before the end of the race held at the weekend.<br><br>Yoong, who walked away from the horrific accident which wrote off the Porsche was, however, transferred by the circuit's medical team to the PutraJaya Hospital for a CT scan when the circuit doctor ruled that Yoong had suffered from a concussion when he couldn't recall why he was in a race suit and driving a touring car, nor any details of the past week. The CT Scan later showed that Yoong had suffered bruising to the frontal lobe of his brain. He was admitted and later transferred to the Pantai Medical centre in Kuala Lumpur under the care of a neurosurgeon there for observation.<br><br>courtesy of crash.net</div>

ITR is lighter somemore. if a CTR can "NUKE" a rex, an ITR can too. and that claim bout "not worth the $$$". praytell which car costs around the same price as the ITR is worth it? say leh. dun tell me rex hor. ITR's OMV a good 10k more then the rex.<br><br>i dunno y but it seems that there are a few persistent ITR haters here. there is no such thing as a "perfect" car. even great cars like the ferraris and lambos suffer from high pricings, the elise for crash worthiness etc. so stop comparing apples with oranges.</div>

YOU're totally off your rocker. Since when the CTR n ITR share the same wheelbase or suspension? same setup DOES NOT equate to the same suspension. Do u know what does setup refer to? It refers to a the springs stiffness, dampener rate, spring return rate, camber, toe-in, bump stops, all that. U can run the same setup on the suspensions, but they are NOT the same. To suggest that the CTR and the ITR which have different wheelbases are same, is to show u totally know nothing about these 2 cars. We can ignore the length of a car and width as well because there are cars which share the same wheelbase, but are of different lengths, exmaple being the VW Golf and the Skoda Octavia. The length of the wheelbase is the key. The ITR(DC5)'s wheelbase is 2616.2 mm, while the CTR(2002) has a wheelbase 2570 mm long. Now please explain to me, how 2 wheelbases of the same length is SAME? Impressive that u went to pains to state all the external dimensions, which are not very important, and left out the most impt dimension of all... eh maybe u should research more before making unfounded claims.<br><br>A car's performance is more than just weight and power figures. Its about chassis rigidity, overall design, proper gearing, and a whole host of other factors. That a McLaren CAN smoke a much lghter and more powerful TVR speed 12 is a fact, simply because, no.1 the McLaren is not that much heavier, and no. 2, the TVR's max power appears on e dyno, not while its exiting a corner, meaning it may have a much more powerful engine, but the question is, can the car handle that much power going to the wheels while cornering? the fact is that TVRs  have a chassis prone to flexing too much, which makes them tricky to drive on the limit. In addition, TVR's cars are set up stock with a softer rear suspenion setup, to counter the body roll when the car flexes mid corner. This leads to an inability to utilise full power on exit, to control the oversteer, while the McLaren is so well designed, so well sorted out that out of a corner the driver simply puts his foot down, and the car squats and goes. Also, do remember that the McLaren is a MR car with better weight distribution and hence much better turning-in characterstics, than the TVR which is FR and front end heavy. Lapping a circuit fast is especially dependent of your corner's exit speed, especially on the long straights, n many circuits have been purposely designed with tighter corners leading into long straights, which is why the McLaren is able to lap faster than the TVR on a circuit. When you talk about comparing cars, you cannot just reduce them to figures and stats, because that is simply to be choosing to leave out a lot of important factors.<br><br>Oh by the way, I have seent he video of the CTR lapping a second faster per lap than the WRX too.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, all your posts have so many glaring errors that im gonna have to point them out to u. i think u need to learn b4 u go and talk to others and be a lughing stock.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tailslide:</div><div class="quote_body">hello, the ITR and CTR using the same engine and same suspension leh. ITR is lighter somemore. if a CTR can "NUKE" a rex, an ITR can too.<br></div></blockquote>Same engine yes, same suspension? nope. same settings maybe, but the same settings on 2 cars of different wheelbases result for different handling characteristics. U forgot to account for wheelbase too. The CTR has a shorter wheelbase, which makes it able to nip into corners faster, as shorter wheelbase cars are nimbler. Furthermore, the CTR seems to have been able to eliminate understeer and torque steer by dint of it having a short wheelbase. The ITR on the other had, does understeer into corners, and suffers some from torque steer. Therefore, if a CTR can nuke a REX, a ITR may not neccessary do so.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tailslide:</div><div class="quote_body">and that claim bout "not worth the $$$". praytell which car costs around the same price as the ITR is worth it? say leh. dun tell me rex hor. ITR's OMV a good 10k more then the rex.<br></div></blockquote>A car's value dun decide how good it drives. Toyotas corollas  have very high OMVs, do u mean they are smoking ITRs on the streets? As for which car costing around the same price as an ITR is worth it, let me tell u. Silva S15 Spec-R. An FR car outhandles a FF car. Anyday. Its much more powerful too. There. I didn't tell u REX.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tailslide:</div><div class="quote_body">i dunno y but it seems that there are a few persistent ITR haters here.</div></blockquote>I also dunno why but there are persistant ITR ball-carriers too. We don't say its a bad car. For a bad car, pls refer to a Lada Samara. We just say its not AS good as u fanboys keep saying it is. u go and ask most people who have a neutral perspective, they would tell u that.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tailslide:</div><div class="quote_body">there is no such thing as a "perfect" car. even great cars like the ferraris and lambos suffer from high pricings, the elise for crash worthiness etc. so stop comparing apples with oranges.</div></blockquote>Well, ok we won't compare it to cars vastly superior. Compare it to its counterparts. It loses to the S15, it loses to the RX-7. It loses to the EVO, WRX. I won't talk about e skyline here because the skyline is sort of a class above. If u want, we can show u a clip of a 10 car race in japan with cars including the S15, RX-7, S2000, WRX, EVO, ITR etc... the ITR finished 8, with only the Altezza and the MX-5 slower. Everyone else was much faster. Now we're comparing oranges with oranges.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>more mistake pointing out.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tailslide:</div><div class="quote_body">what affects the cornering capabilities of a car is the a) wheelbase, b) the suspension geometrical set up and c) the weight and C.G of the car.<br></div></blockquote>U left out a lot of other factors, such as chassis stiffness, fundamental chassis design, drivetrain layout etc.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tailslide:</div><div class="quote_body">in terms of a) and b), the ITR and the civic share the same characteristics. in terms of c), the ITR is superior. not only is the C.G lower (compare the height of the 2. the CTR is a few cms taller then the ITR), but its weight comes in at 40 kgs less then the CTR at 1170 kgs. corner better? i dun think so.<br></div></blockquote>Wrong again. In terms of a) and b) the ITR and CTR DO NOT share the same characteristics. In terms of c) the ITR is not neccessary superior. like u said, wheelbase IS a factor. and like i stated in my post above, the CTR HAS a shorter wheelbase, which makes it a better handler, despite it being porkier. Design -wise, the Civic makes for a more nimble car. Looks-wise, I prefer the ITR to the CTR's tallbody, van-like looks.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tailslide:</div><div class="quote_body">U wanna compare E-class and C-class, thats a different case altogether that, as much as there is truth in that statement, is totally irrelevant in this perspective.</div></blockquote>Its not different case. The E and C have different wheelbases, just like the ITR and CTR have different wheelbases. Its your misunderstanding all along that the ITR and CTR share the same wheelbase that has lead u to think that its a different case, and that it is irrelevant, since it serves to illustrate how cars with diff wheelbases but share a same engine may perform differently.</div>
