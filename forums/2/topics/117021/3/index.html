            <div class='col-md body'>Actually it is well known that in stock export-form, such as the US market 1993-1995 version with 320bhp, the Toyota Supra RZ can run close to a 280 km/h V-Max.<br><br>I doubt that the Japanese market Supra has less actual power than the export version (ie. Just the claim of 276bhp) so therfore its a very fast car in stock form. Remember, the 250km/h limit is imposed electronically, but even in stock form with the limiter the Supra TT has been recorded to touch about 260 (the limiter has a bit of leeway).<br><br>Also do consider that aerodynamic considerations play a large factor in top speed, but not drag in this case (as the Supra as a relatively small frontal area and drag coefficent) but possible negative lift (ie the front or rear of the car feeling 'light' at speed due to a limited amount of downforce and/ or miscoordination of air flow at very high speed) considering that the car was designed with about 300 km/h at hand, and not 390 km/h like the Mclaren F1.</div>

There has to be the consideration of the basic aero efficiency of the car itself. Bearing in mind that while u can easily increase the bhp of a car, it takes much more to be able to tweak the aero efficiency, which is why many racing teams need windtunnels.</div>
