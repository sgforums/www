For pic1.1, road tax 6mths cost $300+(not very sure of the figure, but is about there). 6mths $100 translate to $16 more a mth. So it should not be a prob. Furthermore, imagine the extra power. Even with my 1.4, when I carry full load of 5ppl, I can feel the lack of power, let alone the 1.1 engine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think picanto is a good cheap economical car.<br><br>I used to take Taxi during work... It's frustrating. They don't seemed to be available when you need them. Then there is the matter of weather. esp during urgency and convenience<br><br>The cost I picked up per month exceeds $700, plenty of waiting and walking.<br><br>The road tax of 1.1cc is about $400/per year (after rebate).. Insurance is the killer about $1400 without NCB. Fuel about $250-350. Parking $75 + $60, maintenence free for three years (no worries). Installments about $400/mth<br><br>So, in essence, if you travel the way I did, get the picanto. pay abit more.<br>For the convenience, more liesure activities and travels to more place of interest and, if you consider that it sits more people, the cost technically goes down.</div>

So do tink carefully =) if your finances allow, may i suggest a Getz 1.1 or Kelisa to add to your list of 1.1l and below cars...</div>

Anyway, just my thought.</div></blockquote>"Renting car to practice..." this statement is meant for threadstarter only since he mentioned abt practicing.<br><br>of course for me, i rent to for general purpose use and not solely for practicing.<br><br>ok back to threadstarter who mentioned he just needs a set of wheels to practice.<br><br>Agreed that nothing beats the feeling one developed with his/her car. But I would think tt is provided tt person has no financial worries.<br><br>If constraint by financial worries, I'll choose to rent anytime (to practice/ or for other matters) rather than to have headache over installments and many other hidden cost tt would come together with owning a set of 4 wheels. Life is not all about 4 wheels. One needs to think of the overall picture before they make this commitment. Its afterall not a small sum we are talking about now. Easily amounts up to 5 digit in total for sure.<br><br>Oh im getting philosophical....Pai seh.<br><br>Thread starter, my advise is think twice before committing. I suggest u buy only if u can comfortably afford. Else, choose the rent option.<br><br>cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually it is rather seldom to see ppl buying a car to practice. If that is the purpose, I suggest forget abt buying a car. WHen you want to drive, then go for refreshment course. No point spending 400-500 a month to practice. May as well continue with the driving course. Even cheaper...<br>So what if you forget how to drive? Driving is a very simple task. Go for a few refreshment courses, say 10 times, to pick back the skill. Remember, driving is easy. Passing the DRIVING TEST in SINGAPORE is DIFFICULT!!!</div>
