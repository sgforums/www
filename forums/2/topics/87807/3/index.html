Stake was $5k. And he would wanna lose to a lancer?????.... even he has money to spend also not that way mah u reckon??? He cursed and swear after he lost.... heard he sold his car.... If u understand 40 Tiangs is not a "meet-on-the-road" session.<br><br>By the way if u say that the lancer cannot even meet the first round of COE then does it mean that they got more money coz they can tahan not to last through ten years so meaning ppl like u will have to last it through coz u too rich to risk it...which is which???<br><br>When u been eaten by those modded civics or lancers....... u heard that there is a few lurkin outside...and how long they canb survive??? wat u mean survive???? u mean how long they can live is it..?.<br><br>i realise u keep saying ppl got shots of NOS....how u know....u lifted their boot or bonnet or u inspected their car..... when ppl outrun you means either turbo or NOS is it....???? U wanna try with an NA setup??? i can arrange....<br><br>Turbo and NOS is just a device but NA is still the core of an engine.... But maybe to you is that NOS is the fastest and Turbo boost higher meaning the faster it is.....<br><br>I understand ur car also got turbo hor????? well maybe because u got turbo so u think ur car very fast...... Never look down on NA engines.... they are capable to rev it up til 12k mark on every gear and the power to weight is way pass wat u could imagine.....<br><br>But for ur friend SiR u haven tell me wat the 120 meant...is it km/H???? or Miles...coz u soung like a "kentang" to me.<br></div>

Which is pointless actually, why not atart with a pedigree instead of a frankenstein....with ZERO safety....u seen 'cheebics' wrap themselves around trees...nuff said.<br><br>Challenge an NA setup? Ferraris are N.A.....but seriously I know what the faster Cheebics are capable of, but more importantly I know what a properly set-up one with a good driver can achieve <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Handling wise the very light cheebics will naturally comes out on tops of my 1.6 ton monster.....autoban style driving is another matter altogether <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>120 is in kilometers per hour and I said the SIR has difficulty keeping up. And kentang.....I do not noe what it means but if u have driven a Saab 95 2002 onwards model, especially a modded one, u will not be challenging me on this. If u have never done so than it is POINTLESS to argue with you. Try loading the cheebic with five adults and the Saab with five also....then u will REALLY see the difference <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> In REAL world terms the standard Saab 95 is a FASTER car period. In absolute terms a modded Saab is DEFINITELY faster in every single gear actually it is most of a complete thrashing.....this is against a near standard SIR.<br><br></div></blockquote>Shit. u have a NA car with about 5l? gawd!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have seen a fool in a Honda Civic play with a red Ferrari on the ECP. And man, I tell you the scene was so hilarious!  Ferrari driver was tolerating this mad Honda Civic driver who is tailgating, swerving lane to lane, then overtaking the Ferrari to cut in front of him, and blowing it's engine all the time.<br><br>Less then 5 minutes was all the Ferrari could take of this nut case Honda. The Ferrari gun its engine, I hear from inside my Taxi a sweet roar. Ferrari's rear wheels spun with smoke coming up, and it's gone. It swerved and cut the Honda Civic in front so fast, I clapped my hands inside the Taxi like I was watching some circus performance.<br><br>Stupid Honda Civic was just only beginning to pick up speed! haaaaaa....<br><br>It is outright STUPIDITY to challenge an Italian Marquee. Or perhaps, Honda driver, just want to see a Ferrari's take off power. Well, I saw. And even at 80 to 90KmH, it's rear wheels still spun like it was standing still.<br><br></div>
