The 95 aero 250hp/350NM is a little too expensive @ more than $185K. Actually the boost is pretty pronounced for a light pressure turbo<br><br>For a little over $135K and a $1400 ECU upgrade, u geta a 95 Lpt with 220hp and a stonking 330Nm of torque....which is what I did since an Aero (very nice) is over $50K increase <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>0-100km/hr in about 8.0seconds flat, mid-range is crushing for an auto and top end is quite exciting <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Aero is still faster but for $50K, I can live with 220hp <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Torque did a side by side test of the large SUVs and the contenders are the X5, Porsche Cayenne base model (not the cayenne turbo S....that will be OUT of league), XC90 T6 and Volks Tourage(is that howis spelt?) And the RX300 came out around the top overall losing nothing in equipment or performance to the other 3 which costs significantly more. Perhaps in the handling, a little behind the porsche and X5.<br><br>I have driven a ML320  up to K.L and back before (this costs more than the X5) and still do not think it has any advantage over the RX300.....infact it seems a little slower in comparison. IMHO the RX300 is as much car as the others luxury SUVs but at an affordable price.<br><br></div>
