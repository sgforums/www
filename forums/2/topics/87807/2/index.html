I was in the main road and about to do a right turn to a minor road, this taxi was behind me got so impatience and honk at me (telling me I should had turned already; which I feel it not safe to do so as a have my wife, niece and mum in my Subaru Viki).<br><br>After the right turn, the taxi overtook from my left and cut sharply into my lane without signal and hit my front LHS. After then, he's still not satisfied and performed two E-brakes ahead of me and luckily, I'm able to take full control of my baby and avoided a serious accident.<br><br>With that, we came out of our cars and bloody hell, he is a gangster uncle driver and used hokkien scolding all XYZ wordings and insisted I purposely looking for trouble. I felt threat and warned him back. "Well, since you said I purposely looking for trouble, be prepared, I swear I will look trouble for you using legal way".<br><br>After 1.5 years later with the traffic police investigation, instead of him claiming 1.7k for his damaged and lost of income from my insurance, I claimed 2.2k for my car's damage and lost of wheel. The traffic police summoned him with fine and demerit points. He also had warning from LTA that the authority will not hesitate to suspense his taxi vacation driving licence, and Comfort also warned him and his disposit of renting the taxi was also forfeited.<br><br><span style="color: red;">My advice to all.....<br>You can tap your brake to act as a warning to these type of drivers but<br><br>1) what is the consequence like if you tap too hard and becomes a E-brakes?<br>2) do you think you are a road bully also?</span><br><br><span class="large"><strong>THINK ABOUT IT!!!!</strong></span><br><br>Honestly, I'm once this type of driver too....I'm extremely impatience when I was young.
