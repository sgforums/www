              <p>my car park is always full. everytime when i come back late, i have to pray that there is at least one empty lot for me. so bo bian have to park somewhere near the curb with double yellow line in the car park like other people as to not block other cars. will i get summon for that?</p>
              <p>is the season parking only for that one particular car park beside my house or it also includes those near my house? as there are three other car parks near my house. nearest one is only one block away, furthest is three blocks away . all three of them are big car park at least twice the size of the one beside my house.</p>
              <p>singaporean now very rich. or is it that car is getting cheaper? i still remember the time when my car park was never full. miss those days man. knn...</p>

              <p>my neighbour does do that. Good thing is, if I come back and I have no parking lot but that one with the chair, I will remove th chair and park my car - cos his name is not painted/ written anywhere on the lot itself.</p>

              <p><br>what does that got to do with the TS problem of finding a lot to park when he comes back late at night? i mean, how does the park and ride work out for him... when he has to leave his home car park to go park somewhere else then go take public transport to work dadada... then at the end of the day, he goes back to the car, drives back to his house car park and its full? lol <img title="Laughing" src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <p>my car park is always full. everytime when i come back late, i have to pray that there is at least one empty lot for me. so bo bian have to park somewhere near the curb with double yellow line in the car park like other people as to not block other cars. will i get summon for that?</p>
              <p>is the season parking only for that one particular car park beside my house or it also includes those near my house? as there are three other car parks near my house. nearest one is only one block away, furthest is three blocks away . all three of them are big car park at least twice the size of the one beside my house.</p>
              <p>singaporean now very rich. or is it that car is getting cheaper? i still remember the time when my car park was never full. miss those days man. knn...</p>

              <p>If I am correct, nowsadays the season parking disc no longer shows the address of the vehicle.</p>
              <p>Anyone can park in the red  slots. This happens when say there is an event nearby and people from other estate come attend and park there.</p>
              <p>The only way is to call the white ponti's.</p>
              <p>Its common that even if you have paid season, you might not get at night due to this reason. Some could not go home due to this. They wait until the offenders finally decide to go home. Imagine something may have happened at home and you could not attend to it in time due to your parking lot being illegally occupied.</p>
              <p>Its happened. What to do? Lets close ranks and move on. Meesiam anyone?</p>
