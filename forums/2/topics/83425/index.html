            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... i feel tat u should act really confi, though u r nervous deep down lor... coz once u pass, u can drive on the road st way liao... so drive as though as u r a seasoned, qualified driver lor... cool, calm n composed.<br><br>Some very impt factors to tak note of:<br><br>1. Blind - spots: Mak sure u check ur blind spot when u doin a turn, b4 changin lane, in circuit so, before u do the narrow courses...<br><br>2. Lane changing: Make sure is safe to go in, don too kan cheong, wait tester angry... feel tat u not a safe driver... but cannot over careful. wait he feel tat u not qualifed enough to be able to drive... Don forget to signal! N don insist go in when people don give way...<br><br>3. Stop line: Stop first, wait for  a while, then move off. If u stop a little while only and st way move off, tester dunno u got stop or not. wait kena penalised...<br><br>4. Always give way to pedestrians... don horn at them!<br><br>5. Repeat to urself! i am a qualifed driver! hee hee... drive lik one, but be cautious abit la.... don reckless...<br><br>6. U guy i assume? Best don wear slippers, better wear shoes. heard people failed, esp guys for wearin slippers!<br><br>7. I strongly belive in givin the tester a gd, smooth ride... he comfortable comfortable, higher chance of passin when he happy ma! heehee... don let the ride be jerky!<br><br>8. Traffic lights - very tricky leh... coz if say green arrow on, can move, flashin, mus stop. so best is approachin traffic junction, leg jus cover the brake. in case suddenly turn amber, can stop smoothly...<br><br>9. When approachin road hazards, slow down n so must cover brake... tester the eyes hor, dunno make of wat one! haha. they ways notice all tis kind of small details, eg, u got cover foot brake when approachin road hazards...<br><br>10. Sway sway, at the side of the road, got cyclists... keep as far as possible from them lor... mayb can share lane.... don forget signal if u share lane hor...<br><br>11. After u turn, right turn, don forget to keep back left hor... but u stay in ur lane for a while first, then slowly keep left. u go keep left st way, the feel not so gd ah...<br><br>12. See yellow box, mak sure stop behind it wor!<br><br>** (13), unlucky no... haha, dun put it down... use ** better...  u change lane hor, dun only use side mirror. mus use rear mirror so... i heard from my inst one... one of his student kena taught by tester to use the rear mirror when changin lane... me from school de...<br><br>14. oh ya... tis is impt so... the speed limit is 50km/hr, unless other wise stated, eg, 70, then u can travel bout 60km/hr lik tat... normal road, 50 km/hr only... over the speed limit, immediate failure leh! sometimes a bit over the limit, eg, when u changin lane tat time is ok, so long as u quickly go back to 50km... n circuit hor, max speed is 30km/h only!<br><br>I wish u all the best of luck for ur oncomin test! Jia you oh! Hop is of use to u...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> when pass liao... heehee...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i just passed my tp 1st try last fri. where u taking? anyways, heres a few tips. dress decently and smartly. recommended dressing is shirt and pants. I wore long sleeved shirt with pants, tucked in, and leather belt. Be courteous, greet the tester, and follow all instructions. Do not be nervous, be cool and calm, be careful, and remember all the things u have learnt. B4 the test, mentally revise thru your lessons, take note of what your weaknesses are, and make a conscious note to avoid them. Remember not to drive too fast, to give yourself enough time to react to or comply with any situation or last minute instructions given by the tester.<br><br>Well, thats all i can think of now, good luck for tomorrow!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you'r reading this on thursday night...have an early sleep!....<br>Try to sleep even if you can't... ample rest will up your focus and radiance.<br>I was so excited and nervous... i couldn't. Tossed and turned on the bed the whole night...lol..<br><br>Anyway really be calm and control your mind instead of letting your nervous mind control you.<br><br>I wasen't very nervous at the briefing room but when I learned that I was assigned to a feirce TP which shocked everyone in the briefing room when he scolded and mocked the girl he was debriefing her....infront of all of us which was in the breifing room waiting...  I felt like a wreck and sian half even before the test liao... damm demoralising.<br><br>I was so nervous initially that my left leg was trembling... I was so worried it'll just give way and stall the engine... and worse..my first circuit item was the parallel parking..  so the trembling of my left leg caused the car to suddenly surge backwards as I was reversing side ways into the slot and the surge, strike and knocked down a pole... very very very sian...<br>"the pole so inside you still can hit.." he sneered.<br><br>But remember..if that is to happen to you... don't give up.. don't let it affect your road driving..... I didn't..so I still passed in the end! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I wish you all the best for tommorow! very exciting eh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Please do let us know the outcome!</div>
