When the light is amber, she does not have the right of way to turn right. She is absolutely wrong. What an ignorant idiot. Some people just dunno the rules.<br><br>If its amber arrow, there's no way the motorcyclist will still be moving straight since it is red light already.</div></blockquote>Totally agree. No way she has the right of way if the argument is whether the light is amber.<br><br>In any case, drivers should be more careful at intersections plus amber light situations.  That's why I always stop on amber or blinking lights.  There are so many blind spots at intersections, there is no way you can check every blind spot and still beat the amber light. Better late a few minutes than somebody get hurt.<br><br>I just started riding bike and the road is one scary place for bikers...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Before you read the news below, i hope that you all will try your best in helping looking for witness. Please help.<br><br>On the 14th of sep (Friday) at about 9.45am, my friend, Liu Xia Wei(Alex), met with an accident. The accident took place at the junction of Bukit Batok Street 25 and Bukit Batok Ave 6.<br><br>The motorbike he was riding (Honda CB400 Blue, FT2072) was hit by a silver car driven by a lady of 40years of age. The lady driver was turning right into Bukit Batok Ave 2 and my friend was traveling straight (right of way). Somehow or rather, i didn't know why this lady driver didn't see this on coming motorbike ans knocked him down. he was just another junction away before reaching home.<br><br>The impact of this crash caused my friend to fly a distant, in the process, smashing his helmet. he was sent to hospital but unfortunately, he couldn't survive. he died of skull fracture and internal bleeding. he passed away on the 15th of sep (Sat) at 1030am. both chinese newspaper (15th sep,sat) have carried reports of this accident. he is only 21 years old, having just celebrated his 21st birthday in August.<br><br>He's still so young and have yet to really seen the world. And now, he's leaving us just like that. he leaves behind his aged parents, elder brother, elder sister, relatives and friends. A life is lost and nothing else matters anymore. Even if given millions of dollars, nothing will ever bring back my friend, nothing will ever bring back a son to his parents, nothing will ever be able to bring back all the heartaches and suffering his parents and friends have gone through. all we want is the facts and then we can have closure on this unfortunate and heartbreaking accident.<br><br>I'm appealing to the members to public, who have witness the accident to come forward and provide information regarding the accident.<br><br>Anyone with information, please approach the police or call them at 1800-547-1818. Thanks a lot.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img src></span></div></blockquote>Very sorry to hear about this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
