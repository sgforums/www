The couple was taking a leisurely drive in a Proton Iswara towards Johor Baru, when a Toyota Altis rammed into their car from behind on a lonely road in Gelang Patah.<br><br>The 22-year-old boyfriend, who was at the wheel, was worried about his 19-year-old girlfriend and felt uneasy about stopping as there were four burly men in the car which had rammed their car.<br><br>He drove on and tried to get to a crowded area while his girlfriend frantically called her elder brother on her cell phone and told him that they were being pursued by a group of men.<br><br>However, after a few kilometres, the coupleÂ’s car broke down and they were forced to stop.<br><br>The four men confronted the couple. One of them slashed the boyfriend on his legs with a parang.<br><br>They were also robbed of their wallets, jewellery and cell phones.<br><br>The robbers then bundled the couple into their car and took them to a hut in Taman Tampoi Indah about 40km away.<br><br>There, the robbers took turns raping the girl while her boyfriend was forced to watch.<br><br>Meanwhile, the girlÂ’s brother who was driving around Taman Perling searching for his sister, chanced upon a police patrol car.<br><br>According to MCA Youth Public Service and Complaints Department deputy chief Rodney Soon, the policemen in the car listened to the girlÂ’s brother before driving off.<br><br>The couple was released about 1.30am. They sought help from passers-by who took them to the Sultanah Aminah Hospital.<br><br>The boyfriendÂ’s father later lodged a police report at the hospitalÂ’s police beat base.<br><br>Police could not be reached for comment.<br></div>
