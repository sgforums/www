There can be only 2 explanations for this.<br><br>1st: 1-20km/h on the FIRST lane? What???? You must be the one casuing all the jams on S'pore roads! Seriously, if you were to travel that slow, please, stay at home. Don't create problems on the road.<br><br>2nd: Maybe you also meant that you can go over the speed limit by 1-20kph. Ok, that's alright. But if you meant the first explanation, i feel sorry for motorist.<br><br>110kph is not fast. If a driver can handle the car, so be it. 110kph is only 20kph above the official speed limit for expressway. That's no big deal. Let those who wants to travel fast have the first lane. If you don't want to go above 100kph, please the left few lanes are yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing hasn't been mentioned yet... and that is that cars these days are also more advanced... They are starting to come with bigger more powerful engines, with better chassis that can actually handle those speeds.. So a car these days can travel at 110 or 120kph without any problems at all... The only flaw, is the soft bit behind the steering wheel.. whether the driver knows how to handle the car at those speeds...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>while i agree that road hogging is fairly dangerous, it must be said that speeding excessively is far more dangerous. unless you are really in an emergency (eg. sending someone to hospital), there is no reason to go above 120km/h on any road in singapore. remember - speeding kills. the few minutes of thrill you get from driving fast is not worth the possible consequences which you are likely to suffer. please remember this. i am not a tp talkbox or what, but i seriously think that speeding excessively is very dangerous and should not be practiced. i usually restrict myself to a speed of 120km/h on the expressways as i dont think that there is any reason to go any faster. if you want to race, do it on malaysia's tracks(or the upcoming one in changi  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) please do not risk the lives of others just because you want to experience the thrill of speed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, I agree that speeding is dangerous. I also agree that road hogging is dangerous as well.<br><br>that's why BOTH of the above shld be taken off the roads.<br><br>however, to EVERYONE ELSE:<br><br>There's only two things you can do<br><br>1) Give way to anything faster<br>2) Overtake anything slower<br><br>When a SPEEDING vehicle meets a ROAD HOGGING vehicle, danger x2<br><br>so to all those who are adamant and insist that keeping within the speed limit on the right lane is perfectly fine and the guy speeding behind you is the one in the wrong, you are actually also wrong because you are MULTIPLYING the danger because TO HIM, you are the ROAD HOGGER.<br><br>So regardless of whether you think you are right or wrong, please apply (1) and (2) above but note that (2) is not mandatory -.-</div>
