            <div class='col-md body'>ok la a few more gd points, so i will just comment about the points which i still disagree<br><br>ya ok la give way is good, but i dont think you really should say road hoggers ego big la, as in cos some maybe just dont like to lose. same as the speeding drivers mah, both have the same mentality. the kiasu singaporean mentality <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>accidents happen not just because you cannot control your car properly yeah. even if you are michael schumacher and you drive perfectly, if some hooligan jam brake in front of you, you also cannot stop right? and also the expressways in malaysia got higher speed limit is bcos their roads are much longer and less crowded, not bcos babysitting by garment or what la. some other small countries also speed limit 90km/h.<br><br>okok, i will give way if a car is behind me. thats the first point. the second point is, why must he speed if he is not in an emergency? its not just the driver put himself at risk, but other road users also. its very easy to misjudge the speed of a car that is speeding excessively, and this causes accidents to be more likely to happen.<br><br>ya thats all. feel free to argue back <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel the reason that singaporeans, like in this case, show bad driving techniques/attitudes is because sg roads are really very easy to drive on. With a low level of difficulty, it means that one does not have to be really good in terms of driving skill and mentality to survive on the roads here. Has anyone ever seen the traffic in places like Shanghai, Taipei or even Bangkok or Malaysian roads? I bet there will be a substantial number of sg drivers who wouldn't survive a day there driving without causing an accident.<br><br>Ok I may have digressed from the main topic but basically what I am trying to say that the presence of road hogging probably stems from ugly singaporean mentality and easy roads to drive on. I'm not complaining about the ease of driving in sg roads. I am in fact more than thankful that I don't have to "fight a war" every time I drive out. Some sg drivers should really put things into perspective and take a look around and appreciate sg roads. Perhaps it is only then that they'll adopt a better attitude when driving</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed that taxi drivers are one of the main trouble makers on the road. But you must look in the perspective.<br><br>Taxi drivers would normaly drive 12 hours a day, sometimes longer. They may not be as alert as normal drivers who at most only drives for 1 hour. Try sitting in an unconfortable car with noisy diesel engine with manual gear for 12 hours straight and drive perfectly. It's simply not possible. You will get backaches maybe after 3hours? Your left leg could be tired by stepping on the clutch countless of times. And the road is not exactly a nice place to spend 12 hours on. They have to look out for other traffic and keep their eyes open fighting off fitique.<br><br>Taxi drivers should be one of the most respected drivers on the road as driving a taxi is not easy at all. I agree that some may just cut lane and not signaling. But at least understand their plight and try to be understanding. But all these said, it is still not an excuse to drive recklessly. Not signaling is not a major offense, so don't get so worked up. They have a monetary target to meet.<br><br>So before we complain that taxi drivers are stupid or what. Think from their point of view first. The situation may not be as simple as what you think it is.</div>
