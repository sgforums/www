            <div class='col-md body'>ellisbeck,<br><br>I understand where you're coming from, but I guess you've misunderstood. The vice I'm referring to is that on the overtaking lane - the 1st lane on the right.<br><br>Nobody on the 2nd lane onwards should be alleged of road hogging, unless one's ridiculously slow, say travelling at 70kmh on a 90kmh road.<br><br>Therefore, as long as you keep left (at a reasonable speed of course), don't worry even when someone tries to give you stick. You have my vouch you're doing the right thing, which is in fact essentially what I've been driving at. It's his job to do his overtaking on the right if it's his interest.<br><br>It's nice that you're self-conscious, and may you attain more driving confidence &amp; experience with more mileage clocked.<br><br>Also, as what HolySniper mentioned, you don't have to brake and slow down to give way. This only serves to unsettle those behind you. On a personal note, I'd prefer to keep the momentum going as I cruise along, and not be disrupted by someone in front slowing down abruptly &amp; repeatedly. Perhaps the best you can do is to let off the gas pedal, or at most feather the brake.<br><br>If the party in front wants to enter your lane, it's his obligation to adjust his speed to suit your lane's flow. I guess I'll be as kind as you only when the car which wants to cut into my lane is a double-L one haha.<br><br></div>

And most of these cases are women drivers or old people. Or worst still, they engage in stupid conversations while hogging the traffic behind them.<br><br>If they think there are going slow, please, keep left. And so what if you are travelling 100kph on a 90kph road. You are essentially still hogging the road if you are on the right lane.<br><br>I have seen cases where the driver in front was so slow that people have to overtake on the left and when the slow driver got overtaken, he gets angry and starts to horn and flash his lights. It's pay back for people who think that they are king of the road.<br><br>If the person is over the speed limit, it's his problem. Let the traffic police deal with it. Just follow this simple rule, when you see someone faster than you, and the left lane is empty. Please keep left even though you are travelling at 110kph. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>To add on, by not road hogging the right most lane, we are improving the traffic flow. I travel on the CTE many times. From what i noticed from all these years, the problem lies with slow drivers on the 1st lane. You can see a snaking queue of drivers tailgating the slow driver while there is a huge gap for a jet plane to land infront of the road hogger.<br><br>So please, if we want a smooth and relaxing journey without jams, please keep left if the left lane is empty. Road hogging is not a win win situation at all. If LTA thinks that the avg speed on CTE is too low, they will increase ERP charges. Who do we have to thank, (or rather balme in this case) for the increase of ERP? Road hoggers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
