I am more than willing to help to witness against this crazy driver if it is needed. She was so busy swerving in and out of the traffic in a reckless manner and was tailgating (definitely less than a metre) a vovlo in the first lane in PIE along Kallang at an approximate speed of 100+ (i was about 90 in 3rd lane) that i told my wife that this car is going to get into an accident anytime as long as it continues to drive in the manner.</div>
