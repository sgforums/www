            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is finally introducing CNG taxis. Haha. In some cities (e.g. Hong Kong), the taxis are already mostly (or even all) CNG.<br><br>CNG vehicles are cleaner and more environmentally friendly. But so many cities are reluctant to introduce CNG vehicles because they are more expensive to purchase and to operate. For me, I would rather pay a bit more for CNG transportation in return for cleaner air. (In some cities, the introduction of CNG buses/taxis is driven by the severe air pollution, such as New Delhi and Hong Kong... Maybe Singapore can consider buying more CNG vehicles during this haze... Haha)</div>
