I find the acceleration and gear-change of the CVT very smooth, and with max power coming at ard 2800 rpm, it is very suitable for city driving... I think u find it rough bcos u keep on flooring the accelerator.<br>It is a very different experience from driving normal auto gearbox.

( new car with REALlly .. old engine.. thnk last decade.)<br>but overall.. still suitable for urban driving..  just dont drive and think that you are in an Evolution.... sorely dissapointed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>CVT or manual... with CVT, you don;t feel  the gear changes as it involves pulleys and variable "cones" over conventional. torque converter type of gearing.  suggestion... well drive both CVT and Manual to find out which one you prefer.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>You may be wondering why the COLT cost more.. well simple.. its becoz its got a better enginer.. in terms of economy and power delivery.. more linear torque distribution.. but minus the saloon practicallity.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Aesthetics wise.... Definately a head turner... with sports kit.. it does possess the look. ( but not the heart.. afterall. you get what u paid for..)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Built quality is pretty decent for a Jap saloon. sits 3 pretty comfortably behind.( unless you got 1.9+ m friends who always hitch a ride..)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>All in all ... excellent family saloon car.. with the current pricing...  Just hope that Mitsubishi would stop recycling OLD engines in NEW cars........ . terrible ppl..!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Do seriously consider.... Looks and pricing is its Plus point!!  n Its Made in Japan..........!!  Yeaz!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  .. Minus Points..  Gruff engine n not so excellent fuel economy.. But It does its job of moving the car with no fuss at all. just don't Hammer the accelerator..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Biggest rival.. : TOyota Corolla Altis.</div>
