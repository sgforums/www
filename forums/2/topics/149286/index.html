            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I take car "grooming" or house-keeping, as a very serious hobby. I DON'T allow anyone else, however professional they claim themselves to be, to touch my vehicle.<br><br>Yes, it can be time consuming, as does Golfing, Fishing, Mahjong, ..etc. But if it interests you, and you enjoy cleaning up your car and keeping it sparkling clean and showroom shiny, you will find the kind of time it requires.<br><br>Periodic wiping of interiors is a good regime to follow, but externally, I don't rely on wiping (depends on what sort of soiling it is) as I rely on the layer of wax I lay down every 2 weeks. Waxing is very important in our climate due to acidic rain. Laying down a layer of wax every 2 weeks prevents dirt from adhering to surface, makes tar spots easier to remove, and protects your vehicle's paint surface from the acidic rains we get because of Sumatra's slash and burn die hard habit.<br><br>Regular waxing also creates a pretty tough buffer against minor scrathes, making micro scratches and other types of accidental scratch, easier to buff over and fill with wax molecules. I typical waxing takes about 2 hours, including interior cleaning and shampooing adds another 2 hours. Yes, that's half a day.<br><br>Ready to commit?

            <div class='col-md body'>doesnt mean I dun clean the interior and exterior everyday means I dun love my ride..<br><br>Me? Im practical, I clean the interior only when it's dirty. I dun overkill. I wash the exterior everyday and wax it every 2- 4weeks. It all depends dude.<br><br>Well, I dun need a perfectly spot free car. As I'll never know when it's gonna ride and both my interior and exterior gets dirty. I dun need to bring my car back to tip top condition everyday to make it presentable. I only do it when neccessary. Do you think when ppl see your car, they'll know that it's maintained to such extend?? put yours beside a relatively well maintained car like mine, and see if you could spot any differences. I treasure and love my ride, so I maintain it to a reasonable standard of cleaniness. Im being practical not to keep it to show room conition as in the first place I dun get a car to keep it in showroom condition.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi SunnyMan,<br><br>thanks for your comments... but you may be taking the topic here a little too extreme... ha. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Like what you have mentioned, it is all about a comfortable and enjoyable ride.<br>No one is advocating to clean the car or maintain it to showroom shine (if it happens, it is just a bonus). Or neither are we talking about keeping the car clean and tidy (interior &amp; exterior) is to impress people in letting people know that you have gone to "what" extend to maintain it... the point about some people are impressed with clean cars (because they feel comfortable in a clean car ride) is also a fringe benefit of keeping your car tidy.<br><br>Hope this is no offence to anyone but to steer the discussion back into advocating cleanliness and hygiene in the car through good cleaning habits &amp; maintenance.<br><br>There is no right or wrong method, but just throwing out the net for more tips....

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi you all people who matains your rides.<br><br>Once again, I re-emphasize that wax coating your ride, is VERY important in Singapore's climate. We get rain that is quite acidic due to haze from Sumatra, and also the factories in Tuas area emits by-products into the air and can aget absorbed by passing rain clouds.<br><br>Take note that during each downpour or moderate rainfall, the rain water in a busy road or expressway looks or appear foamy each time a vehicle passes by. If you take a drop of it and allow it to dry on a glass plate, you will see there are many particles residue left behind after water evaporates.<br><br>WAXING, is VERY important. Minimum, wax once every 2 weeks. The more layer of wax you overlay, the safer your ride's paintwork shall become.<br><br>I notice that after waxing my ride, if it happens to rain the next day, I can feel the smooth waxiness of the surface where I waxed has been washed away. Normal rain, does not do that. If rain these days can strip away the slippery surface of a wax, can you imagine what rain can do to un-waxed rides? Our undercarriage is a different story, because of undercarriage rust proofing. But not topside.</div>

It is an all-in-one that can be used for the entire car ; car body, windscreen, leather seats, dash board, rims etc so it is very convenient.<br><br>There is a review on No-wet via this link, and it seems that it has been voted as the product of the month :<br><br>ttp://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art33983.asp<br><br>Anyway, if you just search No-wet via the internet, you can find a lot of info on it too.<br><br>Another plus is that it even have a protective seal against acid rain, water mark, bird droppings etc. Once I deliberately left a bird dropping over night, and the next day, it cleans off easy with just a wet tissue and walla, there was no marking at all!<br><br>It is very easy to apply - just spray, wipe and buff to a showroom shine. I do not even need to wash the car in advance but rather, spray No-Wet directly onto the car even when it is dusty and dirty.<br><br>Now I no longer need to "chop" washing bay over the weekend, bring barang barang such as pail, sponge, cloth, different bottles of wash and wax, glass cleaner, leather protection chemical etc. No-Wet is all I use.<br><br>I always keep the No-Wet micro-mist Applicator and cloth in my boot and will just spray and wipe certain parts of the car whenever I feel like it - any place, any time.<br><br>The interesting fact is that it has been around and perfected since 1994, available in 15 different countries all over the world, but it is only now in Asia/ Singapore.<br><br>Try it and if you have any questions, I will be happy to share my experience on using No-Wet.</div></blockquote>I am sure there will be no stain, but pretty sure there willl be tons of scratch mark. How can you actually buff a car when it is dusty and dirty?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Isnt that similar to using sand paper to rub against your car?<br><br>suggest you look carefully and see how much swirl marks you have on your car.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

Those $450 session or package that you mentioned are definitely different from what you are doing all together, so I think it is important that you get your facts right before trying to preach about grooming here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I think it is a waste of unnecessary time and money, and burning off excessive fuel to let the engine run while you clean your car.<br><br>Btw, where do you usually throw all those wet tissue after you clean your car in the morning and evening? You just dump it at the car park right? litter bug!!<br><br></div>
