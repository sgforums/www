It usually take me about 10 mins to apply the wax and about 20 mins to buff it off.  Furthermore DIY usually show better result that sending your car to those carpark polishing.</div>

I paid S$100 for the Zaino polish and protect and I think its price is OK. Comes will 2 bonus car wash as and when I like. Vacuum interior included, and leather care. Takes about 6 hours to complete.<br><br>As for dent, usually it is the dent remover guys, not the groomers. I heard about S$10 per small dent. The lesser the dent, the more expensive per dent.</div>
