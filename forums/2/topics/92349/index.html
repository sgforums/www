            <div class='col-md body'>10 years loan means you car will remain a negative equity. 5 years break even? Think harder... many people do not do their calculations before embarking on such loan. It may take 8-9 years to break even.

Therefore, you may have to buy a car that you really like and intend to keep till scrap it. You really need to consider all the factors and facts before you jump into it.<br><br>The economy may be peaking up but for sure we won't know what is like in the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

The lowest it can get is its scrap value + COE rebate at that moment. In fact, you still have to pay the dealer a percentage of the value for their hard work of scrapping your car.<br><br>3) You have buy comprehensive insurance throughout the loan tenure.<br>4) If you crash your car, the ins co. may decide it is too costly to repair your car. It can scrap your car and you'll have to top up money after losing your car!<br><br>5) After say 5 years, you get sianz of the car. You cannot sell it 'cos you'll have to top up in order to clear your outstanding loan balance. You end up having to continue paying the instalments for something you don't like. Not a nice experience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree there is no such thing as break-even. Since when does a private car generate revenue? It's a liability from the start.<br><br>First do a projected cashflow calculation. Take into account all your financial objectives (savings, investments, retirement, emergency etc). Once you are comfortable with setting aside an amount to be burned every month, use that amount to shop for a car that you like. Interest payments and loan tenure are subjective. Your real decision is setting your financial objectives, which are the really important things. Once they are set, you can indulge with whatever spare cash there is.<br><br>Don't mess up your life over a car. It doesn't really belong to you. It's a 10-year renewable lease at best.</div>
