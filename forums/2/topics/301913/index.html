Their keys got duplicated so easiler to steal.<br>4) When driving be more aware - take note of cars that seem to following you.  If being follow do not stop, try all mean to shake him off , by turn here and there, do not go to destination till you shake him off.  I got that experience before, the guy even follow still try to follow even it become clear that i spotted him. I did some turning here and there , in the traffic.<br>5) steer wheel lock ! Will help a little, as it make it more difficult and time consuming to steal.<br>6) never leave anything in sight on car. all log in boots . That will reduce the their tempation.</div>
