            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, I'll start out since I'm the topic starter.<br><br>So far been smoked once on the expressway, ECP. Since I got my class 3 of cos.<br><br>Been trying to max out my dad's car(unmodded 1000cc Suzuki Swift) potential. (I know itz not much, but keepin a car in SG needs "mu-lah".)<br><br>While trying out, mostly during the wee hours, 2am - 3am, cos few cars around, some taxi drivers for some reason challenges me at traffic lights(dun understand them, I tot they too tired until cannot think).<br><br>Scenario(my first challenge, or so I've considered it to be) : I stopped at traffic light, 2 taxis(1 yellow, 1 blue) stops at either side. Green light, I floored, they floored, I lead(never challenge them in the first place), I overtake them take right most lane, yellow taxi flashing high beam and horning(I dun understand y he did tat). Reached another traffic light. Yellow taxi stop beside me, green light, both floored, I take inner corner and overtake taxi again, taxi repeat action(flashing &amp; horning), reached home safely.<br><br>Scenario(my defeat) : travelling at 100km/h, 5th gear(save fuel) at ECP exiting Fort road, feeling kinky, floored, reached 120km/h. A Saab(I dunno much bout this car, very bright lights) tailgates me, both overtakes a taxi in front at either side(me left Saab right), the Saab is leading after we passed the taxi, I give a chase, speed 135km/h @ 4500rpm, car vibrates violently, both of us brakes hard at the bend(I drop to 115km/h@4th gear), was able to close up the distance very quickly at the bend, my car vibrates violently again, I slowed down, the distance between me and the phantom Saab lenghtens.<br><br>The experience was exciting and thrilling, I was totally concentrating on the road and corner at the highest possible speed. But the defeat was argonizing, at least I've learnt 1 thing. Skill isn't everything, and never try to take on a bigger car, and I sucked.. Tatz 3 things... hmm...<br><br>My dad's car is going to be scrapped soon, I gave it a chance to prove its maximum potential(on the roads). Its not much but I'm satisfied with the result.</div>

Hope you understand. Sometimes people tend to drive a little faster than normal and interesting incidents with fellow drivers occur. This is wat this thread is for.<br><br>Oh yes, 1 more thing, in an accident, not everytime the driver is at fault. I saw an old man (truth case) cycling in the corner of an expressway, wee-hours some more, is he surpose to do that?<br><br>What makes him think the drivers are going to see him? His bicycle carries no reflector what so ever.<br><br>What happens if a car (touch wood) hits him, the driver is to blame or the irresponsible actions of this old man? Although the driver is charged/jailed/revoked/whipped/wat have you, this "old man" paid with his life by acting irresponsiblely.<br><br>And for your info, people can't afford to "floor" the accelerator everytime, fuel is expensive, in Singapore, you know. So don't worry too much about "racing incidents". Even if there is, itz in the wee hours where the number of cars are the least and at unpopulated (uu-lu) areas(please keep the areas to urself, if you really wanna tell, PM me). And I believe most drivers are responsible for their actions, they only show these feats only once in a blue moon, so why not share them.<br><br>There a lot of threads sharing their victories. But there's a lost match for every champion forged, why not share this "lost" with us? Thats why this thread was born, please don't blame me for trying out something new.<br><br>When driving normally, I shift my gears at 2000rpm, and never go faster than 100km/h(5th gear@about 3500rpm), I know itz slow... but save fuel leh!! &gt;100km mileage uses less than 1/4 of the tank. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> So anyone got this "ding-dong...ding-dong" thingy when you go faster than 100km/h? I find it a cute reminder...ha ha!!<br><br>Darn, I'm long-winded. I apologise for that. Back to the topic.<br>No offense Bear.</div>
