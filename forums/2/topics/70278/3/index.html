They race on a track that offers varied surfaces, from asphalt to dirt. The track also includes jumps and tight corners on both types of surfaces. This particular kind of racing is especially popular in Europe where they have a dedicated race series for it. The racing is usually quite fast, and one needs to be quite aggressive and foolhardy to get (and stay) in front. Crashes and wipeouts are not uncommon.<br><br><img src="http://www.supermotech.co.uk/mettet02/slr/14_andym.jpg"><br><br>I know its a car foum, but i thought u might wanna know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
