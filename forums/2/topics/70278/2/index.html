            <div class='col-md body'>hmm ...... to contribute to this thread ..... i dun have any experience of being smoked.  cause i assume that being smoked meaning that i had totally no chance and can't keep up.  for me, it's always the adrenalin and the way you irritate the other driver  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  maybe cause when i drive fast (urmm .... race, if you like to call it), i dun do it on highways where top speed matters.<br><br>my fav. place to "race" is on the old roads in msia (those windy, single laned ones) and busy highways, where the car is only good to a certain extent, but gutsy moves, good estimations and good control of your car are required.  anyway, there aren't many evos and wrx's as compared to singapore or cars with those sort of power in msia<br><br>i've raced plenty of cars, BMW 318i, honda civic, toyota camry, proton wira, nissan sentra (called sunny in singapore) ..... too many.  i guess i'll just contribute my experience for reading pleasure  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>confirm gonna get a lot of "drive safely", "bring it to the track".  but, i'm a msian driver, the roads ARE the tracks.  oh well .......... anyway .....<br><br>i drive a proton satria 1.3GL manual (same as the Mit. Colt here in singapore), non-modded, the only thing is 13 inch sports rims (my dad chose that).  i used to drive to college for my tertiery education.  and, i will always choose to use the old road instead of the highway (highways ain't fun - quoting a BMW mag with an article on the M3 CSL, any fool can drive fast in a straight line  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )  well ..... i drove on that same road, back and forth on weekends for 2 yrs<br><br>there was once i met this honda civic, 2-door, yellow, beng-ish car.  i'm guessing that it was non-modded, or maybe it's just of some age.  this idiot driver was tailgating all the slower cars, highlighting them ...... it was about 8pm at night.  i was like "wtf?!" ..... then, dropped to 2nd gear and "let the fun begin!!"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>i tailgated him (trust me, when i tailgate, it's very near ..... i'll give it two or three feet at most) and immediately he knew what was I was trying to do.  we took a few corners ..... overtook a few cars (sometimes 4 cars at a time), and by then, he was really pissed with me, cause i never got off his back   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   i was overtaking the same car everytime he did, not caring whether there's enuff space to follow him ....<br><br>it's really frustrating when you are being tailgated, moreover, his car was so "loud" and mine was like ...... aiyah, simple, 100% not-modded and yea, i was driving with a P-plate (probationary) at that time  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">.  well, i could see that he was losing his sense, coz he was too angry for being tailgated by a car like mine.  then, he tried to overtake this car in front ...... BUT, there wasn't enuff space to come back into the lane in time.  fortunately, i saw that in time and backed off.  he was highlighted and honked like mad by the car coming from the opposite direction!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>well, needless to say ..... he backed off for a while.  who wouldn't?  close encounter with a crash   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">    urmm ..... forgot to add that we took corners on those old roads that have 80km/h limits at speeds close to 130km/h.<br><br>urmm .... one more funny thing to add.  i had this classmate in my class.  he was so proud, saying that he followed his friends in their modded cars in KL weaving in and out of traffic on the highways (coz he heard my friends mention the "rides" they had when i drive).  then, i asked him whether he has tried following someone on the old roads.  he said no, but no way he would be scared, cause his friends drive really fast (yes, they do, i've seen one or two of them do their stuff)  so, i invited him to follow me.<br><br>well ....... to cut the whole story short, he screamed hardly 10mins into the journey.  he was like, wtf, are you crazy??!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   so much for high speed experiences eh??   haha<br><br>hmm ..... i sound like i'm bragging, but this is an insight into msian driving.  someone said that they dun understand msian drivers ....<br><br>eutjin talk big only ..... puiks   hahaha.  anyone care to sponsor an Evo for testing on that road?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   it'll be B-E-A-UTIFUL</div>

R-34. i tried catching up cannot sia...hahahaha btw the crx dont know where he is liao after he kena snap by camera. hahahaha</div>
