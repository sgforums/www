              <p>Juz wanna recount an accident that I saw yesterday at abt 1940 hrs at the Lower Delta Road and Jln Bukit Merah traffic junction, was behind tiz jap car, silver toyata if i'm not wrong and heading towards henderson rd and as we were approaching the above-mentioned juntion I could see beyond the silver car infront that a white car turning right from the opposite direction had clearly stopped into half of our lane blocking our way. I expected the car infront of me to overtake and proceed but instead being garang he  floored the pedal and went for it as i could see his car suddenly went abt 2 -3 car lengths before me went straight thru, sway a little to the left to avoid the vehicle that was blocking our path. Big mistake.....the driver of the turning vehicle moved his vehicle and the next thing to happen was like a scene out of the movies.... the turning vehile cliped the silver car from the driver's door all the way to abt the mid section of the car forcing the car to sway to the left and skidded on till the rear left hit the traffic lamp post only then coming to a stop and all tiz happen in a blink of an eye. i overtook and saw both drivers were ok but clearly in shocked.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's a sad fact that in-correct forming at junctions are a common sight nowadays and I hardly see any enforcement carried out to eradicate the act and worst when you try to beat the odds and take the risk than to take evasive action to avoid the vehicle in your path....accident always will and always do happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>drive safe and dont.....dont speed up at junctions, they're dangerous.</p>

              <p>Sometimes incorrect forming is done unintently. Eg, you are unfamilar with the area and maybe travelling along the left-most lane (with a left-turn or straightahead arrow along the road). You may keep to this lane, as you intend to turn left about two traffic lights ahead (you estimate). But after the first traffic junction, the left-most lane turns into a turn-left only arrow. And you have no intention to turn left at this point. What do you do? Most likely you will signal right and try to get into the middle lane (or you may continue to turn left and wonder where you are heading now...), but the middle-lane is jam-packed with cars and then the traffic light infront turns red. So half your car is in the wrong lane. This happens.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is. Safety must always come first. Some drivers are simply too impatient and drive recklessly. Frankly, I think the silver toyota mentioned above is more at fault.</p>
              <p>Yup, do be wary of taxis. A few times, i have them either suddenly stopped infront of me (to pick up passengers) or cut into my lane adruptly out of blue (no reason, just assume  others will give way), making me jam-brake to avoid kissing them.</p>

              <p>Personally, at junctions I always make it a point to stop half a car to one car length away from the white line. Why? Because if an accident happens wherein a car making a turn at the junction gets hit by straight going vehicle, it is going to be FLUNG your way. Saw such things happen too many times, and once nearly happened to me; the car making a turn was hit broadside by a Taxi, and it spun towards me only to hit the divider I was next to and rolled towards the other side of the road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The other thing is that I will never trust the Green Light; I always expect someone to rush it even when it is Green on my side. And also, when you come to a stop behind a large vehicle like a bus or truck, always leave about one car lengths spacing, and turn your steering wheel a little to either side and watch oncoming traffic BEHIND you. If someone loses control such as another large truck with failing air brakes, you stand a better chance of not becoming a BigMac...</p>

              <p>I fully agree with you.</p>
              <p>Back in my learning days, one of my instructors had this weird theory which I don't agree and will never follow. He insisted then, that whenever I intend to make a right-turn in a two way multi-lane-traffic junction, and if I'm the first vehicle, I must stop and align my car very close to the front and right white lines. I argued with him that by doing so, I would be putting myself in danger of the on-coming, left-turning vehicle. Should any vehicle turning a little too wide, it may hit my car. He said, if that is the case, it would be the problem of the vehicle that hit me.</p>
              <p>I would have understood the rationale if you are in wide one-lane-junction (but not any other situations). By stopping close to front &amp; right white line while waiting to turn right, you allow another vehicle behind you to turn-left.</p>

              <p><br>What more can I share with you guys here..except that the most dangerous places while driving are at Junctions, AND, those Round Abouts (Circle Junctions - eg., Tuas).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As observed over DECADES, people still DO NOT know how to use these Round About Junctions;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; most don't know how to signal</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; many do not know which lane to choose when entering into a circle</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; most do not even know that there are lanes in a cirlce</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; almost ALL will cut right out from the inner lane of a circle to exit into one of the 4 branch roads</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; some panic &amp; even stop in the circle! this causes mayhem...</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; MOST do not GIVE WAY</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like I always say; our roads are well designed and thought out, it is the Singaporeans motorists poor (or total LACK of) road manners that generates CONGESTIONS - as well as ACCIDENTS.</p>

              <p>Juz wanna recount an accident that I saw yesterday at abt 1940 hrs at the Lower Delta Road and Jln Bukit Merah traffic junction, was behind tiz jap car, silver toyata if i'm not wrong and heading towards henderson rd and as we were approaching the above-mentioned juntion I could see beyond the silver car infront that a white car turning right from the opposite direction had clearly stopped into half of our lane blocking our way. I expected the car infront of me to overtake and proceed but instead being garang he  floored the pedal and went for it as i could see his car suddenly went abt 2 -3 car lengths before me went straight thru, sway a little to the left to avoid the vehicle that was blocking our path. Big mistake.....the driver of the turning vehicle moved his vehicle and the next thing to happen was like a scene out of the movies.... the turning vehile cliped the silver car from the driver's door all the way to abt the mid section of the car forcing the car to sway to the left and skidded on till the rear left hit the traffic lamp post only then coming to a stop and all tiz happen in a blink of an eye. i overtook and saw both drivers were ok but clearly in shocked.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's a sad fact that in-correct forming at junctions are a common sight nowadays and I hardly see any enforcement carried out to eradicate the act and worst when you try to beat the odds and take the risk than to take evasive action to avoid the vehicle in your path....accident always will and always do happen.</p>

              <p>drive safe and dont.....dont speed up at junctions, they're dangerous.</p>

              <p>I think next time cross junctions will have more of the red-amber-green arrows rather than the old flickering green arrows. Those turning will have to wait until when the red arrow turns green, then they can turn. Those busy cross junctions at Jurong West and East have the old traffic lights replaced with the red-amber-green arrows to minimise such mishaps from happening.</p>
