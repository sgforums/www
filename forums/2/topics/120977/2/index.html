There are simply too many cabs to go around nowadays<br><br>Its not possible to make $200 for 12 hours of driving unless you are super lucky which means you get to pick up your fare non stop the entire day ! Even if you go on half shift, the norm you can make nowsaday, is only around $50  ... and that is for seasoned driver . Newbie driver like me usually make less.. I made only $20 a day when I first started out  as a relief driver. I have heard from the old timer 7 ,8 years ago they could make $100 per day driving just  8, 9 hours a day, not anymore now... these pple lamented times have changed with all these competition like NEL , cars more affortable etc....<br><br>I used to drive to and from work (company van).. believe me driving home was the best part of my work which I enjoyed most (I was a service enginner...and had to supervise a team of 3 techs .. I had to climb up and down exposed to risks like chemical ,gases also).. Its quite different, driving for commuting than from making a living.. as a cabby you have to figure out or plan the route to your destination it is especially tedious to the places, which you are unfamiliar with. Its can be very stressful as you have to figure the shortest and cheapest or best route to please the fancy and whims of your fare. make one wrong turn and your fare will threaten and complain to your company about you.. for normal commuting driving /i would say driving is effortless and sometimes a pleasure. We just do not have to worry about missing our way ...<br><br>Of course there are no excuse for any cabby to drive recklessly you have the life of everyone at stake ..  I am just trying to explain their behaviour of these cabby are compel by circumstancesÂ…if  they do not have to drive such long hours just  to make ends meet ..... I believe there maybe less reckless cabby around.... unfortunately the government is unlikely to lower the $7000 taxi tax per year nor the 140 % tax duties... the sad truth is the only ones making monies from all these are those GLC companies making $$ by renting the cab out to the cabbies. (come to think of it the NGF they are talking about in the military forum is probably funded by the humble taxi driver , the diesel tax alone bring in 1.5 billion per annum to the coffer)<br><br>I breathe a sign of relief when I hand back my cab to the company. Well my experience could just be a unique ones to meÂ… maybe you  have heard of cabby doing very well or actually making a fortune but it has not happened to me anyway for the miserable 3 months.. I am not condoning the behaviors of the cabby at large , however IMO the government do have the obligation to improve the working conditions of the cabby ... ieÂ…lower their cost etc.... I believe it came out in the papers recently ,there are less fare but more cabs on the road nowadays , in short ...supply of taxi far outstrip demand!! So life would only get worse for these cabby ... let be more understanding to these forsaken souls of our society and forgive these sinners. who are but victims of cicumstances. Give others a break and a chance cos we live in this very stressful and unforgiving society ......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>taxi drivers are very stressed????? MY FOOT OK!!<br><br>Go compare the stress level of taxi drivers to that of those delivery drivers ok. have you guys even think about those delivery drivers who besides driving, have to load/unload their goods to customers??being a delivery driver should be more stressed and tiring ok. Each day they are assigned over 10 delivery orders and usually they have to finish all their delivery by 5pm (office hr), and they should be the one who ought to be feeling fatigue and stressed and the urgency to rush.<br><br>Heavy fatigue :<br>Many heavy-duties solo delivery drivers have to carry their goods from their trucks/vans all the way to customers' location, which is usually not accessible and may require them to climb staircases and walk a distance under the hot sun or in heavy rains with their goods ok. Sweat and pant like hell. Poor thing.<br><br>Stressed No.1:<br>If they can't finish all their delivery in time for the day, they'll be screwed and f u cked heavily by their bosses ok, being a delivery driver, they are answerable to their boss for failing to meet the target number of delivery invoices/orders ok.<br><br>Stressed No.2 :<br>In event of bad weathers and heavy rain, they have to stop by the road shoulders and rush to the goods cabin to cover their goods with canvas ok. If their goods are damaged by the rain, they have to compensate with their hard-own earnings ok.<br><br>Stressed No.3 :<br>If they sway sway kenna stuck in the traffic jams arising from you kuku cab drivers tailgating n colliding with other vehicles and cause a massive congestion, that's it...they won't finish their delivery schedule on time and will surely be f u cked upside down by their bosses ok<br><br>How about those SBST and SMRT bus drivers for their long working hours??? How about those bus drivers with their buses crowded with passengers????<br><br>stop complaining ok taxi drivers!! god damn it.  If stress can be used as an excuse for driving recklessly, go think of those delivery drivers and bus drivers. They can't enjoy the flexibility of taking a break like you cab-drivers in the event of heavy rains or tiredness ok. You guys can always take a break at your own flexibility if you are tired.<br><br>Count yourself even lucky to have the luxury to be stationed in your cosy toyota cedric equipped with the latest high tech GPS and customer svc and radio device. Go think of those delivery drivers driving their clumsy and slow toyota dyna and mitsubishi L300 van ok, everyday gotta <strong>sweat like hell </strong>ok!!<br><br>Cabbies wake up your ideas ok. Don't use stress as an excuse ok. Don't risk your driving licence just to speed and drive recklessly for those unreasonable customers who require you to hurry up ok. Cab drivers???? stressed???? MY FOOT!!!! KISS MY ASS OK!!!! PUIZ!!!! <strong>NO SWEAT !!!! </strong>CHICKEN-FEET!!!! PIECE OF CAKE!!!! HA HA!!! ALL THE WAY!!!!!!<br><br>Driving a taxi??????? NO SWEAT OK!!!! CAB DRIVERS PLEASE DRIVE MODESTLY  POLITELY COURTEOUSLYPROPERLY AND SIGNAL JUST LIKE A L-PLATE DRIVER OK!!!! God damn it!!! RESPECT OTHER ROAD USERS OK!!! before more and more people look down on you guys OK!!!!<br>BUCK UP YOUR DRIVING HABIT OK!!!! now the media and LTA has already given you a poor poor rating, and the general public is already condemning you OK!!!!!<br>DO NOT TRY and play punk ok!!!!<br>DO NOT PLAY WITH THE TRAFFIC RULES OK!!!!<br>Do NOT play punk with LTA before the traffic police gives them the right to give you demerit points ok!!!! wake up your ideas mannn....damn it<br>COMFORTDELGRO AND CITYCAB, DO NOT PROTEST AGAINST AND CHALLENGE LTA FOR THEIR STRICT BENCHMARK OK!!! instead, go train your own drivers and instil strict discipline and good driving habits into them to reduce the number of accidents in the future ok!!!!<br><br>Cab drivers??? EVEN PES C 9 can become cab drivers. U go ask PES c 9 to become delivery driver and he collapse and concuss ok. STRESSED UP MY FOOT!!!</div>

I assume you a referring to a job that requires cross-border driving? I did mention <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">other jobs that require people to be on the road - driving - for hours on ends</span></strong>. Would cross-border driving not come under this category of jobs that require hours on the road?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

We have infact deflate the tyres slightly to avoid skidding<br><br>There was once, raining, I was going up the straight slope on PIE doing about 80kmh.. I apply my brake gently as there was a jam ahead....guess what !!! the whole cab skidded fortunately I was able to regain control in time!!<br><br>There was another time this crown was infront of my van at paya lebar where the road were pave with metal plate due to MRT construction .. raining again... this crown was going very slowly as it is a bend, probably 30 Kmh or less , however it still skidded and hit the barricade.. there is nothing this poor  guy could do!!<br><br>i used to drive a toyota Hiace for work I would say the handling of my hiace van is much better and  safer than a crown sedan. as I did not encounter any form of skidding before. Come do think of it, I actually prefer driving a Hiace than a Crown!!<br><br>This bring me to conclude if the cab companies do not address this problem it is not going to bring the accident statics of the Taxi industry down<br>!!<br></div>

But you have done it already. Nice Work ! Wuming. If you pay attention for every 10 cars on the road , there will be at least 2 cabs.<br><br>infact there are a lot of typical car drivers out there whom are also not much better than the cabby. This evening while driving home i met two, There was this corrolla , overtook me at high speed abruptly and cut into my lane than suddenly left  turn into a car park . i have to jam brake.... dun understand what he was trying to do.... in a hurry also cannot like that what!&gt;Hopefully these pple are the exception than the norm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"i_am_a_penis"<br>i think what he says is correct but his wording is a bit to....<br><br>okie.... let make things more simple...... how long to wait for taxi on peak hours or weekends? or even oncall? 10 minutes or 30minutes.......<br>this tells us what?........ yeap... the taxi si getting more and more any the taxi so call claim more competition for their rice bowl.... but why i dont see taxis or hard to get taxis on peak hours?<br>bCos the taxis no. is not enough. Although taxis no. has increased but.... let not forget the population are increased as well.... and more and more ppl are getting lazy....(due to personal reason.... like too much stuff to carry) and take cab.....<br><br>I think few yrs back where although there are less taxi but we can hail or oncall taxis faster... right?<br>So this sometimes makes ppl wonder is the amount of taxis enough?<br><br>Some taxi are arrogant..... and they are not stressed.... they just bo liao and  likes to play....... please dont play with your rice bowl....<br>Lots of time they just love to sprint after the traffic light turn green.... they slow down. Xiao... who is playing with you..... we dont bother cos after tired working wanted to get home or in rush to work.....<br><br>Still the same words.... big cars in spore and taxis are quite arrogant.... merc taxis is even super duper arrogant....<br>i would say.... 50% of taxis(cedric or crown) are yaya type and 90% of merc taxis are super yaya type.</div>

I have sat in a few Merc Cab b 4, I only find them very boastful... say they make 6k or 8 k a month... had been a cabby myself know that is not possible.. if really so good everyone be a cabby y get a degree!<br><br>IMO, most cabby are depressed not yaya. what is there  to be yaya when you only make peanuts everyday.. I spoken to some while waiting at taxi Queue (i waited for 2 hours in airport b 4) .. most lament their income has dropped .. most newbie are retrenched workers also.(like myself) . these newbie usaully make a lost in their business cos they do not know the way and alway lost ... end up have to give their fare a discount.. It is not uncommon for them to make less than $20 per day after 10 hours of driving... most of them quit after they found out this Taxi business model do not work or get into accident.<br><br>IMO , the garment should lower the fare of Cab so more pple will take cab.. but of course  they have to lower the diesel tax from $7000 to $700 maybe. If the garment want to encourage more retrench pple to take up taxi driving to lower the unemployed rate, but I know this is not possible  cos think about the white elephant our scholar goverment officer have built LRT, NEL which are loosing $$$ everyday.. so they are forcing pple to use them also<br><br>I would say most cabby take up driving not becos of interest or by choice. It is becos they cant find other job. They would glady accept job if it pay is around  $1000 than continue working in this ardous system.<br><br>Anyway...I have twice been driven in the latest W211 CDI Mercz Cab and must say thoroughly impress with the refinement and performance... damn shiok!!!<br></div>
