            <div class='col-md body'>Heh... I was waiting for the bus at the bus stop outside Anchorpoint shopping center... saw this taxi in the 2nd lane, nearest to the kerb, think the passenger didn't tell him in time where to turn in... he suddenly braked and tried to make a left turn into the taxi stands at the centre... nearly collided with an MPV behind him and a Vios on his left... The road is 3 lanes wide btw...<br><br>Just now, going home from my gf's place... At the junction of New Upper Changi Road and the MRT track there... near Bedok station... think the driver sleepy or wat... he wanted to beat the flashing green right turn arrow... couldn't make it in time, jammed brake just before the turn... then he slowly reversed back into the lane... knn... nearly give me heart attack...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>No one said being a taxi driver was easy. That still does not give you the green light to road rog or drive recklessly. </strong><br><br>I concur totally with the author on the above.  But after driving for long hours , your driving habit, style and manner would start to deteriorate for the worse. You will start driving abnormally.. which I do not know why<br><br>Maybe its becos you start to loose your concentration, your awareness drop. The stress and fear of unable to make end meet for the day will induce you to drive recklessly something dangerously. The pressure from the passenger who pressure you that they are hurried for time and late , you have to drive faster and change lane cos of last min direction from them etc....<br><br>Infact, looking back I  thought it was foolish and stupid with some of the 'stunt' I did. All I made was a meagre few dollars I risked my life and others.<br><br>Dun be mistaken I am not those WRX or civic cheongster .. most of the stunt I did are last min changing lane and sudden deceleration cos the passenger direction was too sudden and last min. the most dangerous things I done, I think  was pushing myself to drive when I can could barely open my eyelid and in super exhausted state but I had to cos I had to make end meet ...... I remember there was once I push myself so hard that I had chest pain could not breath and had to stop by the road side for half an hour rest before slowly making my way home<br><br>All I can say is I am safe driver normally, I became reckless becos of fear and stress and compel by circumstances.....<br><br>Pls understand our problem nobody wants to risk their own or others life we are just trying to make a living.. that is what I can say of most taxi drivers...<br><br></div>

While a person may have his share of manual or mental work to begin with, it's all not as monotonous as the 10+ hours of driving..<br><br>Perhaps you might want to try cross-border driving for even 10 hours on a regular basis before you might understand the situation they're in. I'm in no way supportive of their driving behaviour, but I'm not for the sweeping statements that people make about cabbies just because they've experienced bad cab drivers along the way..<br><br>If you were to think about it, an driver would brood more about that Cedric which swept into their lane dangerously more than the saloon that did the same thing. Why? Because they are more easily identifiable than the average saloon and our cognition would only lead us to one conclusion: CABBIES..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
