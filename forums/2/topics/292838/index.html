            <div class='col-md body'>The article below is entirely fictitious. Any resemblance to real events or people is entirely coincidental.<br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/mcfjiayong/18112007289Medium.jpg"><br><br>Car Club Name: NH-Zero<br>Car Club members: 91' EG6, 00' Ek9, 07' FD2R<br>Car Club Vision: To be fast on track, in a car modded for daily driving.<br>Car mini Write up: We research into our mods before applying them. We do not want our mods to reverse Honda engineering. In puristsÂ’ thinking, we would like to think should Honda Engineers not be restricted by marketing or environmental guidelines, they would have done the same.<br><br>NH-Zero's first member is coincidentally also the oldest car in the family. At that time, the other two members were driving Honda Civic FD2(now EK9) and Toyota Altis (now FD2R).<br><br>The next member to join took a little convincing. After a few weeks with the EG6, the Altis owner was convince that he wanted a Honda next. And not just any Honda. It has to have character. It has to have that subtle hint of prowess behind that H badge. Behind that Red H. Thus the long wait for the JDM FD2R began. The day that PI World of Wheels brought a showroom set in, Altis zoomed down to get a smell of it. Caressing that sweet chassis, sniffing the new car smell, humming to the tune of the idling K20A, the decision was made. The FD2R was to become the next member of NH-0.<br><br>Have we forgotten about our Mr Civic FD2? Try as NH-0 might, we are unable to find much upgrades that we felt that Honda engineers would agree on. A pair of affordable coils were chosen to make the PG tracking sessions more enjoyable. The Search for the Holy Quest continues. After months of frustration, the next step towards Honda Godliness was decided on. At the right time, a Spoon 5.1 Final Drive was chosen and with a stroke of luck, a Type R LSD was on sale too.<br><br>These two Â“weaponsÂ” were then added to the arsenal of the FD2. By this time, the FD2R has arrived and has been ran in THROUGHLY. And trust me, itÂ’s really THROUGHLY. The ultimate test came. Is the FD2 any step nearer towards the FD2R? Would Honda Engineers frown upon the 5.1 Spoon final drive? Not many Civic FD2 drivers have been able to stomach the thought of the 5.1 final drive.<br><br>A race seems necessary!!! This was held impromptu....one particular night, at a traffic light, a naughty grin followed by a cheeky blast of their horns set them roaring off!<br>And loh and behold! The FD2 was side by side with the FD2R even when they shifted into the 4th gear!<br><br>Then the first inkling of the 3rd and rarest member of NH-Zero came into the picture. Mr EG6 was strolling down Shenton way one day, skiving at his work, when a NH-0 colored Hatch came into view. Illegal waiting at the road side, basking in its own glory, the EK9 was just silently humming away. Such engineering perfection! Mr EG6 couldnÂ’t resist, he just knew that contact has to be made with this Type-R Angel. One of the rare few left in SG. Counting those with legal log cards, there should be only 2. Numbers were exchanged. And the gentlemen promised to keep in touch.<br><br>2 months passed.....Mr Civic FD2 was still trying desperately to find out more mods for his car. And he always met with a blank wall. And one day, logging into www.sgcarmart.com, the wall was broken down. The White Angel was on sale, beaming in all its Type-R holiness. Mr Civic FD2 realized that the only way forward, was to take a step back. To change platform - to change the Civic FD2...into a Civic EK9.<br><br>Arrangements were made, and the transfer was done. It was fate that brought Mr FD2 and the EK9 together, thank to a skiving banker, an uncle digging nose in an EK9 at Shenton Way, and two Cantonese-speaking families.<br><br>The following pics depict the first congregation of Club NH0. The birth of NH0 was of the humblest of origins. 3 young, single, lonely(horny) drivers, washing their cars in dirty tattered t-shirts and bermudas in a small HDB MSCP at AMK Ave 1. Taking a break at the coffeeshop, over cups of tea and coffee, NH-Zero was born.<br><br>Thank you for reading.<br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/mcfjiayong/IMG_0562Medium.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/mcfjiayong/Image0481.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y135/mcfjiayong/Image0251.jpg"><br><br></div>
