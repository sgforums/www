            <div class='col-md body'>You may be able to find a good buy in the resale car market given the high turnover of new cars in recent years.<br><br>If you intend to drive for a short 2-3yrs, resale is more worthwhile provided you buy one that is no older than 3yrs old.  Upon resale or scrap 2-3yrs later, you will likely get back more rebate value compared to a new car.<br><br>If you want to drive for 5yrs or more, go for new car since COE is at all time lows nowadays which makes depreciation much lower in the longer term on average.</div>

I drove 3 resale cars before starting to buy new, but in the past COE was at different level.</div></blockquote>For a new driver who intends to drive only for 2-3 years, buying a 2nd hand car has 2 advantages:<br>a) Being a relatively young driver, try out with a used car to perfect your driving skill.  If touchwood, there are some driving mistakes committed, you won't feel so "heartache".  Secondly, you can find out what you like about your preferred car (performance or comfort or reliability or fuel efficient?).  This is important so that you put your money on the right type of car you want.  Does not make sense to throw in say $70k on a new car to find out that it is too slow (but cosy and comfortable) to your liking.<br>b) as what kmkm pointed out, a brand new car being sold after 2 - 3 years will suffer a lot of loss.  Get the previous owner to absorb the new car loss and take over from him at a good price for the 2nd hand car.  You won't lugi so much when the car is sold when it is about 4-5 year old.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most welcome.  Buying car is definitely a value losing venture, so the key is how to minimize loss, which is = what you pay Â– what you get back.<br><br>So knowing how long you intend to keep the car is very important.  Compare different scenarios to make a better choice.  DonÂ’t just buy because everyone around you tells you so or itÂ’s the in thing.<br><br>Of course, this is an evaluation purely from a financial perspective. Guess it may not be of much use if your spouse insists on buying what he or she likes, haha. Good luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
