            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, recently I went to XXX showroom to test drive. Subsequently I and e saleperson started to talk on how to go abt the process of buying it. I then request for some freebies but however it was kind of turn down as he reasoned that his commisson was oni very little @$400- 600. So he could not give me anything beside the sensor at the rear for free which comes from his earnings, therefore I would like to check with u guys is it ok for me to ask for free items from him n is it true of wat he said( so lttle of commission)??? haf i been smoked? pls kindly share ur views.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

The commission is also inclusive of the COE, because they offer the car as a package, instead of breaking down the price in detail.<br><br>If you are sincere to buy the car, go for what you exactly need. Don't be shy. MP3 player, 4 speakers, rear sensor, alarm, leather seats and Vkool are some basic things you'll need. Other than that it's what you feel a car should have, spoiler, sports body kit, fog lights (SG got fog meh?), roof rails, etc etc. They will not likely entertain internal modifications like cool-air intake filter, change strut bar, etc etc.<br><br>If you need to, look for at least 5 dealers who sell the same car. If they all say the same thing, and you still don't feel comfortable, then walk away. Not worth spending so much $ and not be totally happy with your choice.<br><br>Send me a PM and I can recommend my dealer to you. He's good at his job.<br><br>Open CAT price is now 1-2k cheaper than CAT A. So he is right to switch COE strategy. The whole car duty price (tax), sending to LTA to pass inspection, fixing up the modules that you asked for, should not require you to pay extras. Afterall, if the company is really so broke till they cannot afford that, I think you better swap to some other company.<br><br>Just 5 cents.

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course I can't publish my dealer's name. But PM me, I will give you the contact. To buy car only hor... not chatline.<br><br>Anyway, to say that the commission per car is $400 is not impossible. Agent sometimes pay basic salary, and give them overhead per car very low. Thus, $400 is really possible. The most you can squeeze is maybe another $100-200 max. Agent very smelly one... always abusing the plentiful young and energetic salespeople. They set targets that can hardly be met, and the staff turnover is damn fast.<br><br>Another thing about agent is, they most likely don't offer many mods. They will give you the extreme pathetic basic ones, or the ones that are official (e.g. sports kit package, or sometimes cars come in 2-3 official models). It all depends on which models they bring in, because agent only bring in export models.<br><br>I also realised that Parallel Importers also have strategy. Those with the car already in showroom, and they are selling you THAT car, my personal opinion is that they are so desperate to sell that sometimes they talk nonsense. I've been to 2 such showrooms, and they tell me really fantastic things, even condemning models that aren't in their showroom. If the car in showroom is what you already set your mind on, then go for it. Else... walk around, ask more people. Money don't grow on trees, so make sure you are satisfied with your buy.<br><br>Last of all, which has not been discussed yet, DO NOT take 100% loan. I feel that any car dealer who offers that is really not your friend, because they lure you with small cash gains, but you end up paying over $10k in interest. Another example is to go for 7 year loan instead of 10 year loan. My own car, the difference between 7 and 10 year is $7k+!! Imagine you pay $7k+ more over 3 year difference? Not worth it. Luckily I got good advice, sat down with my dealer and worked everything, and he made sure I understood everything.<br><br>So... ask for everything you need, and can afford, and dump everything into the loan, and enjoy your ride. Hope you get a good deal.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hear from reliable sources that it's not necessarily the case that all car salespeople make big bucks.<br><br>The company sales commission can be quite low (a few hundred $) although the commissions from the finance, insurance and 2nd-hand dealer (trade-in) etc can add up to quite a lot.<br><br>You can always  try to ask your salesperson for freebies but don't expect to get any/all that you ask for. Being thankful if you get a couple as they need to make $ too esp when their basic salary (if any) can be quite little. Some distributors also have a policy of not allowing their salespeople to offer these freebies.<br><br></div>
