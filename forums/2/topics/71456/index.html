            <div class='col-md body'>Incident happened on : 1/3/2004 @ around 2045hrs in Jurong Point Carpark.<br><br>I was to meet my friends in Jurong Point so I decided to drive there. I drove there, found the Jurong Point Carpark, went into the 3rd lane from the left and stopped at the barrier.<br><br>I wind down my window and was going to press the "ticket issuing machine", well, I never expect it to be a cashcard reader. I was like... WTF!?!? Realising I have no cashcard with me, I quickly reverse up the slope and enter the 1st lane from the left, thinking that at least 1 lane should be accepting cash payment.<br><br>But ALAS!! I was wrong. I stopped at the barrier, switched on the hazard lights and called my dad, hoping that he'll tell me he's got an extra cashcard somewhere in the car, but no.<br><br>Feeling anxious, I got out of the car(hazards still on), was trying to get a fellow driver to lend me his cashcard, but feels too pai seh to do so. Luckily, I remember a security guard by the carpark entrance and quickly seek his help. I paid him $2 and he opened the barrier. He also informed me tat I dun have to get out of the car to get him, just talk to him via the comm(@ the cashcard reader) and he'll get to me.<br><br>Sooo pai seh... I was like a country pumpkin, dunno anything. Hell, when did this "cashcard carpark entry" applied?? I didn't know a thing bout it. *slaps forehead*</div>
