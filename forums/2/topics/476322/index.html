              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">just to share a story of mine of a chain accident(3 cars) along ecp, before tanjong katong road exit 11 on 1 nov 2013, around 1240pm.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">i was travelling along the ecp, there is 2 plant pruning, 1 after another. after the 1st plant pruning, i return back to lane 1, after i realize from a distance there was another plant pruning, i than change to lane 2.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">upon reaching near 2nd plant pruning, i realize the car in front of me e-brake, i than quickly e-brake. i was able to stop in time, just than the car(toyota vios, WNY8633) behind me hit onto my rental car(suzuki swift sports), than cause my car to hit the front car(mazda 3).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">i did look at my rear mirror before the accident and saw a malaysia car tailgate behind me. but of cause i had a distance away from the front car.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px;">i get off the car, and shock to see the car that hit behind me is a malaysia car. after than this person from the malaysia car than started to shift the car and told us to shift the car to the shoulder lane. right after we have stopped at the shoulder lane, the malaysia driver didn’t not say anything to me, but to quickly pull up the engine cover and look at his car. i than proceed to see the damage infront, where it was quite minor, just scratches along the rear bumper of the front car. me and the front driver than exchange particulars, take pictures.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">out of the sudden this person appear saying he is the claim advisor and told us that we need to make a police report, because it involved in an accident with a malaysia car. (i already know that someone will sure appear when there is a accident). we than proceed to the nearest police station. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">when arriving the police post, only the front car driver allowed to make the report. at that time i’m trying to get that particular of the malaysia driver, but than his relative, which is a singaporean(honda odyssey, ED123Z) give me his phone number, and address him as Ng. he then hurried away with the malaysia driver saying they got something on, need to go asap. however i will not know whether they have make a police report or not. for me, i did not, because the rental company says no need. for now, the only contact will be Ng. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">the rental company than call Ng to ask to pay for the damage of the vehicle, in which they agree to go to the workshop which Ng give them the address of the workshop. however upon reaching the workshop, the workshop make a quote of 1.5k to repair the damage. after some discussion, Ng will not pay for the damage. Ng did also give phone number of the malaysia driver to rental company, but he did not pick up. despite many attempt to call Ng again and malaysia driver, they didn’t pick up the call.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">i tried to send a sms to Ng, but didn’t receive any reply at all. in the end i had to pay the damage of the mazda 3($400) and the suzuki swift sports($1.4k) that i rent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">i really hope that they could at least pay a few hundreds. but they simply say "i have no money to pay". :(</span></p>
