If you are more of a family man, go for Altis. Altis has a bigger boot than Mazda 3.<br>For me, I bought the Altis liao..quiet and smooth..the acceleration is not so good but ok lah..<br>I think Toyota has a better resale value than Mazda. Personally I would go for Altis as it is cheaper and Toyota's reputation is quite good as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought the Mazda3 Auto 1.6 was advertised at $77K in the Starits Times over the CNY weekened launch? Unless I mistook that price for the Mazda2. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Toyota has always had a better resale value. However, Altis is not a Japanese import. So, that might change.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel the price too high. Think the Mazda3 is will lower the price half year down the road. The price is always higher when it just launch. Same thing happen to Mazda 6. Not a very worthy buy. But still many cant resist the temptation and the first shipment of mazda3 has been fully booked. Maybe second shipment also, not sure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi.. i juz bought the altis.. i was also pondering the same question before i bought the toyota.. before it was launched i checked out the usa website on the mazda car.. the exterior look imprssive and interior too.. and it has vvt engine is looks pretty sporty.. but after the lauch of mazda 3 and certain recent reports made me feel that my choice of altis of over mazda 3 is right.. because in my case i am looking for a car which i can drive for a certain period of time.. looking at the reputation of toyota and its recent 'world number 2' win over ford.. its reliable, roomy interior and classy look made the car very much worth the 74k.. i personally test drived the car and felt that it was real smooth and the pick up is not bad. the stering is light and not to mention the braking.. the interior interfaces are not as impressive looking as compared to mazda 3 but it has a mp3 player compared to mazda's 6 disc changer.. and automatic aircon compared to mazda's manual one.. and btw altis's engine is vvt-i.. and additional intelligence.. but i am not sure if it makes any difference.. it really depends if u are a frequent car changer and if u really like a sporty one.. if u are looking for a reliable and smooth driving car.. i would strongly recommand the altis.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> and btw toyota mentioned that the car was assembled only in thai.. the parts are made in japan and qc is definately from japan... so i must say there might not be much of a quality difference..

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! I'm new here. I agree that Toyota is one of the top Japanese Brand.

            <div class='col-md body'>As wat i have been told in Mazda showroom , the body of mazda3 seem to be too heavy for a 1.6L engine so the pickup from 1st to 2nd gear will be quite slow but it will incress in the power when it reach it 3rd gear. As for the rating from the european , wat i can say is dat , we cant really compare their Mazda3 to ours as they are having a 2.3L engine in it , so it make a big diff in the fuel saving part n the power in pick up.<br><br></div>

Only that The M3 look sportier than the rest. It has been tested extensively and prove to be very nimble than the others. You must be surprised if i say the 1.6 has better fuel economy than its 2.3 sibling.(refer to <a href="http://www.mazda3forums.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mazda3forums.com</a>). As for the pick-up it is nothing to brag about its about the same with the other 1.6 corolla and Nissan. If you looking to have a good pick-up you should be looking at a true sportster like the Mitsubishi Evo.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Go for Toyota If you can accept that the Altis a Thai product. Borneo claimed that the car is assembled in Thai but parts are from Japan, however  take a look at the engine parts and chasis and compare it against the 2003 model. You will notice the difference.  Most of the car parts are in fact manufactured in Thia and not in Japan.<br><br>Having said that any car from Toyota should be reliable.
