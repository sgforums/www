For Gen2, to me all is oustanding. But, i notice a problem. Which is the back cabin is too compact and is too low as well. If u sit at windows sit on behind. U will "knock" your head on the roof top. This is a serious issue. And also, if u find 3 friend to sit on behind. It is shoulder to shoulder gap space. And you can't sit for 4 person. It is totally impossible. Pls have a visit the nearest proton showroom to "experience" yourself the above "issue" that i had mention.<br><br>I am sure u will change your perception.<br></div>

At first, i will go for Gen2. But, after some "consideration". Real sitting is a major problem for me. U know lah, in Malaysia. Travel from 1 state to another or 1 place to another. There is always quite a distant. Therefore, comfortable is the main concern. Anyway, on behalf of Proton, i thank u people for supporting Proton. hahaha..</div>

And because of this, the Gen.2 has a near-perfect driving position. Steering, pedals and gearlever all become extensions of your limbs,<br>reducing fatigue and increasing safety due to a relaxed and natural movement.<br><br>That is if, like I, you fall within the 95 percentile of the world's population who drive cars such as this because even in Malaysia the five per cent also buys the car. And they either complain of sitting too tall and not having enough leg space or as for people who seat at the rear, a clear lack of ample headroom as a result of that sharply defined Cpillar. Thankfully the seats feels liveable and it is still possible to seat four adults in comfort.<br><br>Great driving position, less than satisfactory rear passenger headroom."<br><br>The issue is already mentioned in the review, anyway another sharply defined C pillar car is the Mazda3 Sedan. Btw, the Gen2 looks very similar to the Mazda3 Sedan, especially the front and the side, with the rear looks like an elise(Lotus influence). Most sports sedans will have some trade-off in terms of Rear Headroom some form or another.<br><br>Anyway, since you have bought your Spectra, I shall keep the comments to myself, once sat in my colleague's Spectra...<br><br></div>
