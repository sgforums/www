            <div class='col-md body'>I've been driving for 2 months, a really young driver.  I'm a big-time newbie when it comes to parking dad's car. If you'd give me an old Concerto to park, no problem, I feel much more at ease since it isn't so big. But the real problem comes with parking dad's Accord 2.0. It's as long as a Nissan Cefiro I think and I find the reverse parking horribly, horribly difficult.<br><br>Dad's short, I'm short. He can't see the bonnet edge, neither can I and there's no way to adjust the seat height cos everything's motorized.<br><br>Just a couple of days ago, I wrecked the bumper at a multi-storey carpark trying to squeeze into a tight lot.. there went 800 bucks down the drain... lots of embarrasment cos every single eye in the carpark was just PLAIN STARING at the bumper when the incident occured, probably thinking "his dad's gonna kill him"..<br><br>The real problem is that I can't see the bonnet edge, neither can I see the edge of the boot from the driver's seat, no matter how hard I strain my neck upwards..<br><br>Some of you guys would say.. "Practice makes perfect..." but I can't keep going on like this and I cant afford to wreck another bumper. There is no way dad's gonna install a corner sensor cos he's just plain stubborn and wants the car to look "original"...<br><br>Are there any other tactics or methods you experienced drivers would mind sharing? I'm thinking of putting a pillow underneath me while I'm driving, is that a bad idea, cos I'm kinda worried I'll be flouting any traffic laws ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how tall are u? anyways, when parking, use the side mirrors to judge where the rear of your car ends. as for the front, that u will really have to just get used to having a feel for the length. My mom's short, im short, but we both have no problems parking the Merc E class. my mom taught me where the critical spots are so I know which parts of the car to use as a reference point. I think u can ask your dad where he usually gets his reference points from.<br><br>when all else fails, u can try opening the door or window to look out from. while i usually would reverse the car in even if i have my head out the door or window, i would actually advise u not to. back it in a little bit, handbrakes on, look out the window or door, and decide how much more u need to reverse, pull your head back into the car, and then disengage the brakes n continue reversing.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Try to angle ur car more before entering the lot.. check ur side mirrors to see if ur rear bumper 'clears' the other cars front, then slowly back in and watch your other side mirror to confirm.<br><br>Slowly angle in and straighten at the earliest possible time. Then now u muz worry about how deep to go cuz as u said, the car is long. Agar gauge the car model next to you. If it happens to be a big car too, can more or less follow him, while checking ur rear and side mirrors too, or popping ur head out.<br><br>Or even going as deep as u dare, then coming out of the car to physically check behind. Mite be 'embarassing', but less than knocking the wall.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Try to go into the lot at a 45 degree angle..use both side mirrors to judge the distance and slowly reverse into the lot... if you cant see anything on your side mirror ( like me ), wind down your window and look...to see if you are in the lot.. you can always open the door and look as well...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with guitarman1 and suggest going further from the lot, turning your car earlier so that you are already 'straight' early on.

It isn't because of your weight; the seat was made that way to keep you from slipping.<br><br>So use the cushion for just the tight parking situations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">[/i]</div>
