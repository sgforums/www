            <div class='col-md body'>i can understand u were pissed perhaps thats why u listed the car number minus the last alphabet. but u were unsure of the make of car. somebody went to list out the complete car no, make and date of reg. thats a bit too much. anyway i m sure u have driven for quite some time. driving in Singapore is like this. if we were to get worked up over every incident whether its our fault or not we will b very unhappy at the end of the day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
