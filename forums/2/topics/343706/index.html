              <p>hello all.i was working last night,there was a road rage outside my workplace and i happened to see it.so,this was what happened.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/2cp9n2f.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></p>
              <p>ignore the date.i have to use a picture to describe.</p>
              <p>Car A parked at the red circled area to pick up the groceries from his wife.often,there are cars parking there to pick up groceries but this time round,Car A parked in such a way that it was blocking the traffic.If he parked properlly,the cars behind will be able to go past in between Car A and the cars parked at the lots.</p>
              <p>The driver of Car A did not consider the fact that he was actually blocking other cars' way.He came out of his car to help his wife to put the groceries into the boot.</p>
              <p>When the driver of Car A just came out of his car,Car B (from the back) horned him because he was blocking his way.The driver of Car A simply ignored and took his own sweet time to put the groceries into the boot.Moments later,there was a little jam behind with 4 more cars behind Car B.</p>
              <p>After puting the groceries into the boot,the driver of Car A got back into his car while his wife went to return the trolley.Car A drove forward abit and stopped again to fetch his wife from the trolley point.Car B horned him again.</p>
              <p>Next,the driver of Car A came out of his car and walked towards Car B.From what i saw,he attempted to open the door at the driver's seat of Car B.The driver of Car B came out and i saw Driver A was pushing Driver B.They pushed each other and stopped when their wives came out to stop them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So,whose fault exactly is it?</p>
              <p> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hmmm. Car A i suppose.  Cause as what you said, he's blocking the way for other road users. As long as which ever driver start to be aggressive, which is Car A, as you said he approached driver B, i think driver A is at fault. If i'm not wrong.</p></div>

              <p>Car A is at fault. He doesn't own the road and when there is a jam because of his actions, he should courteously drive away or at least wave a hand of apology to the drivers behind. Every driver pays road tax, so all of them have a right to the road. Whats more, he still go and confront Car B. Car B driver can report him for assault.</p>
              <p>Btw, this pic looks like the NTUC at serangoon gardens. Is it there? If so, police post nearby only. If I am the driver of Car B, I'd threaten to drag him there man...</p>

              <p>Worst of all, he still wanna approach Driver B, he should just show a sorry hand signal or something. You also mentioned that about 4cars behind carB, isn't that suppose to be DriverA fault for casuing all this? Why he still want to find people fight? =.=</p>
