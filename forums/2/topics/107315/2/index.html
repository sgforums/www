IF u go to asian women welfare site, they actually has some articles written on it. But this is abt some guy who question the use of seatbelt n why the govt is imposing a law against it.Then dun ask about singapore law,other countries are imposing the same.In UK, if u dun hav a child seat, its a no go.<br>So u are right, his argument or the lack of it, is seriously warped.<br>For me, I don't justify laws or why others can do this n i can't, I  belt up because its the right thing to do, for my passengers n for those around me.Everytime I step into the car, I am responsible for the safety of those inside,outside and myself. and that includes shutting off the frickin HP when Im in a petrol station.<br>Drive safe, drive smart.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.<br><br>While you're at it asking why, NOT wearing seat-belts, is against the LAW -you should also go ahead and ask; WHY is committing suicide against the LAW?<br><br>The analogy is simple; if in the case of a botched up suicide, you don't die and becomes incapacitated, who will have to look after you if you have no next of kin? Or if your next of kin, does not have the financial ability to sustain your medical needs? And in the case of NOT wearing a seat-belt, the scenario is very likely similar; who is there to take care of you if you DON'T die? Even if you do have someone or an entire family to take care of you, wouldn't your predicament impare the abilities of members of your family from contributing to society fully?<br><br>Everybody knows that in SIngapore, it is best that a person dies thereof, rather than, to drag on indefinitely incurring exorbitant medical costs.<br><br>It's already so hard to make a living here as a healthy person, can't imagine how much worst trying to keep a mangled body alive!!<br><br>It's cheaper to die in Singapore.</div>
