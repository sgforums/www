            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. I used to own an accent 1.3L Hatchback 3.5 years ago. It's the model just b4 the current face lifted model.<br>Of the 10 months I owned the car, it was in the service centre for about 4. Having said that, Komoco was very kind to provide me with a replacement Elantra. These were the following problems:<br>1) the gear box had a mind of it's own. At rest, I was unable to engage into the first gear. It often jams up and I am left being horned at when I stop at traffic light junctions.<br>2) On the move, I am unable to shift to the 2nd gear, thank god this problem was not present for the higher gears<br>Acc to KM, this was due to some gear clutch mismatching thing. This, they replaced the gears, oiled the transmission etc etc....... even changed the entire gear box..... to no avail. They even got Korean experts to take a look at the car when they were in S'pore.<br>2) Virtually absent sound proofing, The tuffcoat sound clad thingy was not really doing it's job. Acc to KM, this was because of "spot welding"<br>3) Wheels as skinny as twiggy....... I skidded 3 times.. and this was when I was moving off. Had to change the wheels to accomodate wider tyres.<br><br>After which, I sold my godforsaken car at a great loss and KM was kind enough to offer me a good price for the Elantra, which I drove for 3 relatively acceptable years. During which, I only experienced:<br>gear fluid box bursting - thank god I was still at home then, the thing just when kaput and I was unable to engage into any gear at all. Had to tow the car to KM<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Im considering buying a hyundai accent 1.5 GLS (A). Actually wat is attracting me most to it is the price... and also the design not too  bad...  esp with the new sporty headlights and rearlights... but has anyone encountered or noes any other probs wif the car? Cant help doubting since it more reasonably priced, that the car would encounter some problems (as mentioned in the a/b threads). I personally feel that the hyundai cars has improved alot... and frm wat i see and know im quite satisfied so far... design and performance wise... coz i juz need a simple car for transport...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, i ve been driving a 1.5(M) since 2000.  Basically, it's a basic car to get you from point A to B... also value for $$$.<br><br>So far, I ve the following problem:<br>1.  Gearbox problem...long time back when there was a mass recall for gearbox servicing.  I remember the Korean Engineer even came down to S'pore to do some checking.<br>2.  Air-con.... I guess the condensor motor reached its life at 3yrs... worn carbon bushing...causing the air-con fuse to blow.  Spent $100++ to replace the motor.<br>3.  Battery - change twice so far... I think the current drawn is pretty high so the battery life is abt 1.5~2.0yrs only....<br>4.  Auto-lock.... wa the autolock fail me donkey years back....<br>5.  Alarm system..... it also ka-pu sometime back..... fail me when I was going to return home one night from office.... no choice, i ve to take it off, then drove without the alarm system.<br>6.  Fuel consumption: good if you travel more highway...got 14km/l when i gone 80% highway:20% urban (also no jam like CTE...coz i dun travel thr there now.....heng!) b4 when i had to use CTE....i only got 10~11km/l<br>7.  Road noise.... high...now getting worst as the car ages...<br><br>Btw, you guys have observed whether your engine top got minor leak..... when i did my servcing at KM... seem like this is also a common problem....esp when the car &gt; 2yrs......<br><br>I also agree regarding the road holding ability of the car..... beware of sharp corners..... try you best to keep the speed moderate, i think the car cannot take high speed corner..... coz the roll of the car is quite obvious.....<br><br>Good day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
