            <div class='col-md body'>i think we'd better remove this thread.<br><br>my idea on China workers (zhong guo de gong ren zai singapore) is that they contribute to singapore's economy like many other nationale workers here. Even though it took pretty long time for me to find them as natural and naive, i don't think that should be looked down upon.<br><br>we do not despise the white ppl as we consider they are well mannered (superficially, still the attitude toward local ladies are strange enough. and i do not express this as the nationality/parent was not my choice). however my conception on them is that they are snatching the fortune which was from the sweat of indian/china workers (or our (grand) parent) away.<br><br>whenever i pass by the road maintaining site, i always thank for their sweat and hard working till their skin become red/black(and this could be one reason we think they are not local chinese).<br><br>they are the people give us the comfort/convenience to some extent. let's just try to look for the very nice friendship among indians and innocence from china workers.
