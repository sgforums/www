            <div class='col-md body'><div id="post_message_2660418">Hey everyone! Just a short intro about me, I'm an aspiring journalist hence I’ve been writing articles to get some practice at it. This is my very first try, so you can say I’m pretty nervous about this.<br><br>This article’s style is based on those humor columns you read in the newspaper’s lifestyle section or you know the full page of columns in The Sunday Times just before the comics? So maybe to appreciate this article better you may need to alter your expectation of what’s to come.<br><br><br><br>Unknown to most people, by law, I can drive. Or at least I would like the traffic police to continue to think so.<br><br>At the wheel, I drive like a cat stuck on top of a tree. My friends who have the unfortunate experience of being in car with me have all agreed that the term paranoid would not do justice to how I behave while driving.<br><br>I swear- my life expectancy skydives every time I drive. By the time I've reached my destination and parked the car, I'm so happy I practically tumble out of the car glimmering with happiness and a silly smile plastered on my face that says, "LOOK! THE CAR AND I ARE ALIVE!” So distracted by my excitement of not being killed in an accident or by my parents (in case of an accident) that half the time I forgot to lock to car when I walk off.<br><br>Society is oh so demanding and yet so unforgiving towards failure. Everyone wants me to drive fast, reach my destination quick...while not getting into any accidents. Thus far, I've scratched the car once and gotten into two near accidents. Thankfully no one was injured, no second party was involved, no traffic records and my heart did not (although attempted to) leap out of my throat.<br><br>My Mom springs into mind as the type of driver I would fear on the roads. She honks at others' slightest mistakes, gives no sympathy to "P-plate" drivers (like the poor me) and name-calls all slow moving vehicles on the road "buffalos".<br><br>I never did drive like this in driving school, I would like to think I would be one of the best there, passing both theory tests and practical one in my first try. Furthermore, I got only 8 points (you get points for mistakes, collect 20 and you fail) for the practical test which my good'ol Mom retook three times.<br><br>Maybe it's because there was an experienced driver beside me to guide me, to brake for me, to die with me in case of an accident. Maybe my trainee car screamed "Please forgive me for any mistakes, I'm a stupid noob" so I will be automatically forgiven for any mistakes. Maybe NTUC insurance will cover for me in case I accidentally decided to change the shape of the car.<br><br>Well, in any case, I sure do hope with time and (lots) of practice (which involve providing free labour by sending my sisters to tuition) my guts on the road would improve from timid to calm-till-honked-at.<br><br><br><br>Well, I sure do hope you guys had a reasonably enjoyable read <img class="inlineimg" title="Smile" src="http://talkback.stomp.com.sg/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Please do leave comments on what you really liked about it, what you didn’t and what you think I could improve on my style of writing. All of these mean a lot to me, I’m running short on time to write good articles as I’ve got a professor to convince if I want to get a place in the university to study journalism.<br><br>Thanks ya’ll and have a great day!</div></div>

              <p>I think you've got a good grasp of the language and I like your candid style of writing - doesn't distance yourself from your readers.</p>
              <p>But I think to be a successful journalist or writer takes more than that - you have to interest your readers. That's what sells papers or books, I guess.</p>
              <p>Allow me to be blunt, but your "article" was rather boring to me. I think I lost interest by the second or third paragraph.</p>
              <p>So my suggestion (not that I'm one to give advice), is that you need to capture your readers. Either build up and draw in your readers, or write on something that people really interests people.</p>
              <p>Just my 5 cents <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
