              <p>From what i know,</p>
              <p>(1) Is the bmw 650i cabriolet considered rare?</p>

              <p>(2) Why there are so many 6 series on the road?</p>
              <p><strong>A: Not more than 3 and 5 series right? 6 series, IMHO, looks sleeker and nicer than 3 or 5 series.</strong></p>
              <p>(3) is it a great

              <p>Yes,</p>
              <p>SLK is nice, but i think SL is even nicer and rare.</p>
              <p>You hardly see SLK 350 because Singapore got ROAD TAX, higher CC pay more road tax and insurance..</p>
              <p>That's why all these things made SLK 350 rare.. cos basically just same platform but different engine.. People who want speed will not go for SLK 350, they will spend the same amount of money on a GTR.</p>

              <p>Shawn, the six is still a big car, so whilst it is a great drive, don't expect it to handle like a 3 series. It is a rare car. An even rarer car would be an M6 cab.</p>
              <p>SLK is ok. But if you want to get an SLK, then get the new Z4, just test drove the z4 twin turbo it was a magical drive... and it has a hard top. But the SLK to get is the SLK 55 AMG. Now that is ultra rare.</p>
              <p>If you are thinkin SL get the SL65 Black Edition. A monster of a car...</p>
              <p>That said, the GTR is a great car... I still have fond memories of my R33 Vspec.</p>

              <p>  Sure the 6 series is a great car. Like what Breyton had said, don't expect it to have nimble handling. It is more of a Grand Tourer. 6 series is rather common, but the cabrio is a lil more rare.</p>
              <p>  The SLK is oso rather rare. Since is quite a light car, SLK280 is sufficient i guess. Also, a number of SLK owners are ladies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  Having said that, 6 series over the SLK for me. More relaxed, grand, practical, larger. Just my 2 cents worth. Both cars are equally rare i would say. You getting either car wor? Try the audi S5 then?</p>

              <p>yeap im actually looking for cont cars in my top piority but will not look for 2nd hand though. im actually abit greedy which i want both speed + style and have a attractive road presence which people will look at . budget to be around 260+ but less than 300. actually before that im pretty interested in GTR so i went to TCM to enquire on it but theirs is black edition and not premium edi. Though SLK 55 AMG is already sold out or smt? so now torn between an SLK or smt related to that and for some reason i hate the BMW Z4 .i feel that it has an ugly overall shape. BUT which definately have a greater road presence which pple will look at ? GTR or SLK?</p>

              <p>  I'm not very sure about this, but if you buy the GTR, be prepared for the monstrous amount of mantanence that will come. Just take a look at the number of second hand GTR for sale at sgcarmart. Is a lot! Also, GTR is not continental.</p>
              <p>  Related to SLK350 will be the Porsche Boxster S 3.4. It is a porsche that is prettier than the 911, though people see it as a poor man's Porsche sadly. The slightly prettier would be Alfa Romeo Spyder, but performance wise, a lil disappointing.</p>

              <p>no offense. personal view. the SLK is a little truncated looking. something is not right somewhere. for merc sport, to me, SL or nothing.</p>

              <p>The GTR would be a great car no doubt...if you can afford the heavy maintenance. Almost as fast as a Gallardo, yet at 300k, can be considered a steal. Also, the GTR has all the fancy electronics, so it really is a great car. But the maintenance is a real put off. Like i said, look at the number of second hand GTRs on sale now.</p>
              <p>Last month was stuck between 4 continentals saloons, and i'm still stuck. Buying cars no hurry de la. Haha. Wanna consider the new BMW x6? Damn gorgeous. If only i have that kind of money...</p>

              <p>  If parallel importer is ur fren (the boss i mean), go for it lo. At least u get better deal or service or wat. If not go buy from TCM la. GTR is sportscar. maintenance warranty is a must de. TCM covers everything le. So u can buy in peace? PI u buy, when the bills start chalking up...u drive the GTR  oso worry here worry there le.</p>
              <p>The difference between the PI and AD is $44,200 for ur GTR Black edition. I am not into GTRs, but my advise is work out ur maintenance fees, etc. Ask the PI wat he offers, then as TCM what they offer? Wat PI doesnt offer, work out the difference and see of the $44,200 is justifiable or not. Chances are, the scheduled maintenance, warranty, audgemnted product and services etc wud add up to over 44k.</p>
              <p>Oh...in case u dunno, each transmission in a GTR is mated specifically for each engine in that GTR. So if u damage ur transmission, you have to get a new one tailored for ur engine. Sounds cool eh? Not cool for ur bills. But the GTR is definitely a cool car.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Shawn now that you have said that you drive a 350z... the SLK will definitely disappoint. It does not handle as well as the 350z, maybe you should look at the 370z? Its cheaper than the GTR, but does drive well for the price.</p>
              <p>It also really depends on what you are looking for on a car, you want to be a poser or you want to drive the car? what is your main aim, it seems like you want to be noticed, if that is the case, then it is still the GTR...</p>
              <p>If you want a drivers car, then get the Z4 or the 370z... or the porsche boxer or cayman. Or maybe even consider the M3 cabrio, looks and performance and handling... the dct is a sweet gearbox..tried it on an M3 saloon.</p>
              <p>The boxer will run circles around the merc and it has more badge value... if that is what you are after... or you may want to consider the new audi TT roadster.. great engine... competent chasis... failing everything... then get a 135i convertible. One very very fast car. I really enjoyed driving it for the day I had it.</p>

              <p>no offense. personal view. the SLK is a little truncated
              looking. something is not right somewhere. for merc sport, to me,
              SL or nothing.</p>
              <p>to find something in the $$ ball park, for me it would have to
              be the 335 cab, if u die die wan to have a convertible. try go
              c&amp;c and PML and ask them to drop the tops. then go drive them.
              make up ur own mind. which i have a sneaky suspicion u already did.
              u r just looking for support that u made the right choice.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i  have still not made any decision yet. sigh cant really decide so im still stuck at my 350z. for some reason i will not get the 370z cause i cant really see much diff between my current car except diff engine i think? my ultimate aim is to get a car that have a great road presence and performance as well as style . GTR i notice when it is stopping at traffic light like not much stares on it? correct me if im wrong . But when i saw a SLK without the top , sure people will look at ? am i right to say that? But then again the gtr have the performance everything. sigh buying a car is not easy but choosing a right car is definately not any easier. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well I recommend the Audi S5, looks nice &amp; LED daylight sure attract attention for people who do not know what is it, acceleration don't cannot match GTR 4sec but its only 1sec difference. I don't know how much is it a head turner but it is the only coupe other than BMW M6 which actually I find it nice.</p></div>

              <p>sorry SBS, but the S5 is very dead in terms of driving feel. not that great. as is the problem with most audis... fast, but no soul.</p>
              <p>the 370z whilst it may look similar to the 350z is actually smaller I think. But there are a whole host of under the skin revisions which make it handle better than the 350z.</p>
              <p>So you want to get noticed... hmmm.</p>
              <p>M6 cabrio.. secondhand maybe?? It's a great choice.. :) But then I am biased.. I love my BEEEMMMMs</p>
              <p>Actually see SLKs all the time and I don't really pay much attention to them... show me a bentley or a rolls I will look.. maybe a Jaguar XKR convertible... quite rare in Sg... drives well enough with decent performance.</p>
