              <p>Is cost of driving in Singapore the highest in the world?</p>
              <p>The number of ERPs that Singapore government is setting up is now uncountable. To drive in Singapore, one needs to pay COE, road tax and now ERPs. With the recent increase in commodity prices - oil, rice, soya and electricity, singaporeans now have to face an increase in the number of ERP gantries and an increase in ERP prices.</p>
              <p>Can government find a better time do it? or is it really necessary to implement all these gantries? has it proven to reduce traffic or has it just move traffic to a different timing? is this just another way for another division of singapore government to earn more money? do we not have enough money in our reserve considering singapore is one of the richest countries in the world?</p>

I personally would rather pay on the spot and at the very moment that I pass the gantry. It is a hassle to go online or call a hotline.<br><br>So though ERP is bad, other cities gets it worse than us. But after saying all this, I want to make it clear than I don't like high ERP charges also. But I'd rather pay ERP than to get stuck in a massive jam everyday.</p></div>

              <p>Your words are facts - I have relations residing in London and I know about them too.</p>
              <p>But have you considered the cost of living in London with their gross pay factored in?</p>
              <p>You have to measure it according to the economies of scale.</p>
              <p>The best way to benchmark such situations would be the use of the percentile mark.</p>
              <p>However, I would like to add that the city charge applies to only the city which is equivalent to the CBD cordon that we have in Singapore and that to me is perfectly fine.</p>
              <p>It is implemented in every developed state to reduce gridlock in the streets within the CBD.</p>
              <p>However - ERP is coming to the average man's estate. Is it justifiable? Or simply to prevent people from detouring and avoiding their current system?</p>
              <p>Think tanks ahoy!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>London tube frequency is extremely high at about 2-3 mins apart. The tube covers the city so well you can walk from 1 station to the next in about 10 mins.  It is also said that Hong Kong MTR has a higher frequency than Singapore and not as expensive as Singapore. Not sure if true. If only Singapore MRT can maintain that kind of frequency for the bus and trains than no one has to pack like sardines into overcrowded trains/bus like 3rd world (feels like 3rd world every morning). People will be happy to take public transport to enrich our monopolistic transport system. But from the news paper forums, we know the frequency is not that high, and it is not sustainable because there seems to be delays here and there every day. Cycling in Singapore weather and traffic is out of the question. Taxis are increasing the charge, Just took a cab from Capital Sq to Plaza Sing and it cost about $7.  So all the price hikes by the transport companies, fuel companies, regulators, taxes  - people feel the pinch</p></div>

              <p>Well, S'pore MRT do get delay once in while when someone jump onto the track. With the endless rising cost, I wouldn't be surprise if the frequency of such "delay" will start increasing too. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p><br>You have to consider the operating cost now, and a decade ago. Oil prices are now at it's highest now. Surely you know that MRT runs on electricity. How is electricity produced?

Sometime you must look in the company's point of view.<br><br>Thus, I think the point of comparison you made (a decade ago thing) is largely invalid because everything else, not only MRT prices, have increased.

              <p>Actually, our ERP is not that bad compared to London. Their "ERP" called "Congestion Charge" is much worse. Because the hours are fixed, and there are long operation hours, like 7am-6pm kind of timings. And they have to pay 25 pounds to enter the city area. 25 pounds is about $75 Singapore dollars.<br><br>See how expensive their charge can get? The only advantage is that they charge the fee only once a day. So you can drive in and out on the same day without paying extra. But, how many times do you drive in and out of the city each day?<br>.</p>

              <p>look at their profits over the years. and i believe the increase in ridership over the years could have covered all the increase in operating costs.</p>
              <p>correct, COE and road tax are the only things that decrease. but there is a better way to squeeze now than COE and road tax which are 1 time payments.</p>
