              <p>Want to share with my experience with the Geely CK 1.5L automatic car and hope some one else could share his/hers.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I just bought Geely CK a month ago. Run-in for about 2 weeks
              without modification. There are three huge problems with the design of the car
              that I was wondering how the car is going to sell well.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">1. The engine noise was unbearable - like a sawing machine
              next to your ear each time you press against the accelerator. The noise is not
              those that you like to hear as compare to those sporting noise.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">2. The low end torque is terribly bad. The dragging of
              engine makes you feel that the engine has run out of breathes.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">3. The fuel consumption per liter of fuel is about 10km. Which
              is quite bad for a 1.5L car? Found that the car's auto transmission uses
              hydraulic system and the gear switch from 2nd gear to third gear change at more
              than 40kmh and 3rd to 4th gear switch at about 70kmh. These are pretty high speed;
              no wonder the fuel consumption is so high.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After the 2-weeks run-in at a mileage of greater than
              1,500km, I decided to modify the car to solve the three issues.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">1. I designed and built a resonator box and fixed it in front of
              the air-filter box. Result is very good. It solves the noise problem and makes
              the car more like a family car. Those interested could email me at
              ss7259@gmail.com.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">2. I fixed the E-Power System (an automobile enhancement
              manufacturing company in Singapore)
              to improve the low end torque and more smooth driving and acceleration. It also
              improves on the fuel consumption to 10.5km per liter. I'm quite satisfy with
              the performance except the car's hydraulic auto transmission system which I
              could not do anything without void the warranty.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Any one has any advice or has done anything to improve the
              car?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">SS</p>

              <p>Well since you made a choice to put your marnie investment into such a vehicle... yeah you might as well learn to live with it cos this has a resale value much less than a korean make... and those are already very, very low. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/pig.png" alt="pig.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nonetheless, pretty impressed at how you tried to tackle the problems you're facing with your ride. Good work with the sound fix. Mind explaining how the E-Power System works for your car?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps you can try increasing the tyre pressure... yeah it affects ride quality but could help consumption in the long run, reduce tyre rolling resistance I dunno... You could replace the spark plugs for better one to see if it does something to the engine running out of breath. If not, the car's probably designed with a poor exhaust system.</p>

              <p>1. Its not original...front copied from Merc C-Klasse, back resembles the previous gen Opel Astra</p>

              <p>hi all ... thanks for your advice and inputs. but ... after driving for sometimes with the modification, the car seems to be a much better car to drive taking into consideration this is the low end car at that type of price. I believe it is much better than the other low end car. probably this china car needs touch-up in order to be more driveable. wonder why geely don't do that. probably could compete with others and sell better.</p>
              <p>gather from the e-power guy that his system balance the engine performance on air, fuel and electrical. you could go to this website for more info. lots of references there. www.pristinenergy.com. this e-power plays a major part in the driveability of the car. maybe you should try. it also save fuel as well.</p>

              <p>Pls don't talk cock here.. Your Geely only has front disc but rear drum brakes, and you want to compare to a Altis which has all round discs? Probably the only reason why your Altis brakes may seem ""inferior"" to your Geely is because you probably neglected to change the brake pads on your Altis while your Geely is new. I'll like to see how long your china brake pads last. Probably longer, considering your Geely is significantly slower so you probably won't get much speed so you end up braking less.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good effort; try harder next time.</p>

              You should've took manual for Geely dude. Geely sucks to the bone when it comes to acceleration especially at the low rpm so if you're driving an automatic that sucks at acceleration, driving in malaysia would be a pain when it comes to overtaking. Imagine you're uphill, need to overtake a lorry going at 60kph and you're probably on gear 4 or 5 by then. You can't down shift to gain more power when overtaking using the opposite traffic lane. 
              Drove my friend's Geely MK to malaysia but fortunately his is manual so its not that bad.
              
              Btw, which shop sells the E-Power System? Does it make a big difference? Is it worth the investment?

              Yeap... comparing the built of the first generation (CK) and next generation (MK), it is a huge difference. The MK is quiet, sound proof body (Don't make much noise when heavy rain). Bigger boot, solid door....
              Maybe Geely might be the next toyota some years to come, maybe not. We won't know.

              <p>Want to share with my experience with the Geely CK 1.5L automatic car and hope some one else could share his/hers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just bought Geely CK a month ago. Run-in for about 2 weeks without modification. There are three huge problems with the design of the car that I was wondering how the car is going to sell well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. The engine noise was unbearable - like a sawing machine next to your ear each time you press against the accelerator. The noise is not those that you like to hear as compare to those sporting noise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The low end torque is terribly bad. The dragging of engine makes you feel that the engine has run out of breathes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. The fuel consumption per liter of fuel is about 10km. Which is quite bad for a 1.5L car? Found that the car's auto transmission uses hydraulic system and the gear switch from 2nd gear to third gear change at more than 40kmh and 3rd to 4th gear switch at about 70kmh. These are pretty high speed; no wonder the fuel consumption is so high.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After the 2-weeks run-in at a mileage of greater than 1,500km, I decided to modify the car to solve the three issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. I designed and built a resonator box and fixed it in front of the air-filter box. Result is very good. It solves the noise problem and makes the car more like a family car. Those interested could email me at ss7259@gmail.com.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. I fixed the E-Power System (an automobile enhancement manufacturing company in Singapore) to improve the low end torque and more smooth driving and acceleration. It also improves on the fuel consumption to 10.5km per liter. I'm quite satisfy with the performance except the car's hydraulic auto transmission system which I could not do anything without void the warranty.</p>
              <p>Any one has any advice or has done anything to improve the car?</p>

              <p>Well, am I now? I apologise if I came across as such. First of all let me address this particular statement you made. -<span style="text-decoration: underline;">"</span><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I'm driving a beamer to work. Shouldn't I be the one to say that it sucks? All it takes is some appreciation and passion for driving."</span> - </em>Are you implying that a person who drives a beamer has a right to have on an opinion on cars or a better opinion on cars? Or are you saying that if I don't drive a beamer, my standards should be lower; that a passion for cars constitutes me having to have compared two seriously miss-matched vehicles?</p>
              <p>Hmm, lemme see.. well one thing for sure when I mentioned cars, I'm pretty sure I did <strong>NOT</strong> mention anything about being a supporter of the U.S. Neither did I trample on China's booming industry. I <strong>did</strong> mention that there are many things that are China-made that are well accepted by industry standards. As for Singapore safety standards, I might add that when it comes to dirt of politics and money hungry industries, safety standards are just there as a guideline. They are not set in stone, so long as pockets are kept fat... please don't be naive and see only what you want to see. By the way, there is a difference between copying and photocopying. One is aspiration, the other is just plain unoriginality based on mass production.</p>
              <p>And here's the <strong>REAL</strong> kick in the face. Don't assume you know where my loyalty lies, China-men are taking our jobs because Singaporeans are getting too pre-occupied with their paper chase. Everyone wants a <em>'good job'</em> and comfy office. They want the good life, spoiled rotten by the way society is today. Nobody wants to toil in the sun, we as a society have no skilled workers that are keen to take back our jobs. We let the Bangaldeshi/Thai/China-men do the dirty work. Soon enough they'll be teaching in our schools if not already present. Then we.. as in <strong>YOU</strong> claim they take our jobs *blah blah blah*. </p>
              <p>Let's face it, they got the jobs because employers get to pay lower salaries, they don't want Singaporeans because they expect to be paid handsomely. Would you rather hire a foreigner that works 365 days a year at minimum wage or a Singaporean that has high expectations and goes for reservists 3-4 maybe even 7 times for periods up to 3-mths a year? Plus no make-up pay and no employer-CPF contribution for foreigners... DUH!!</p>
              <p>As for the U.S;they're playing big brother to the world and its high time they get a wake up call, they should solve their own problems before policing the world. Stop f-ing around with the world's economy...</p>
              <p>So you see, if you haven't understood my previous post, you should have exercised your right to not say anything that makes you look like a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">racist biggot</span>. Your ill-informed posture and you remedial excuses do not interest me. I gave my two-cents for the hard working types,<em> the holding a two-jobs to support the family types</em>.. so that they know that if they want/need a car they should know that there are options like old fashion saving up or else they'd risk spending money to fix stuff that shouldn't be fixed in a brand new car. If you disagree with me, fine.. you have your right to your own opinion (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">as diluted as they are</span>). But so do I...   -Piece of advice, don't bite off more than you can chew, yeah? Read carefully so as not to dish out a rebuttal that makes you look like - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an ass who says things for the sake of saying them</span>. Good luck in understanding/digesting/absorbing everything I've said. Yes..., it was meant to sting...</p>

              <p>Dude. Your reply is too long, I don't bother to read it. Here's my short reply to you.</p>
              <p>One glance at your reply suggests that you're here not to give any productive advice or opinion. I bet everyone who reads it will agree with me.</p>
              <p>Here's an advice. Stop whining.</p>

              <p><br>Nice to know you can admit you can't read a reply that rings true.. Good on you for the short reply, better not say anything else..., just in case you accidentally say something else that makes you look dumber... Good luck with the rest of your pathetic life. Cheers..</p>

              <p>Can you stop hijacking other people's threads? Want to advertise, just go to Marketplace. And even if you go to Marketplace, I doubt you can put up your advertisement there, because you are helping your shop do publicity, and it's not allowed.</p>
              <p>Stop being so cheap. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
