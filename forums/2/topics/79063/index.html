It is because of the LTA regulations on Tinted films. You can click <a href="http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/motoring/information/maintain___repair0/modification_guide/modification_allowed.html#MainPar_0070" rel="nofollow">this</a><br><br>The following requirements must be met when installing tinted films:<br><br>a) They must not be of the reflective type.<br>b) They must be tested for compliance with light transmittance requirements by a competent agent accepted by LTA e.g. Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board (SPRING) and authorised vehicle inspection centres.<br>c) The resultant light transmittance for the front windscreen and two front passenger windows must be at least 70%.<br>d) The resultant light transmittance for the rear windscreen and the rear passenger windows must be at least 50%.<br>e) The front windscreen must not prevent, obstruct or interfere with the transmission of signals between the In-vehicle Unit (IU) and Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) facility.<br><br>If not approved by LTA, then they advise you to remove the film. So far only V-kool and Huper Optik is approved by LTA.<br><br>However, if you car window is tinted already, my advise to check thier package so that you may not want to get worried whether it  comply with the LTA regulations. V-kool will perform a test to see whether the car is suitable certain package.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not because of the LTA regulation, I notice the price for solar film are quite x and heard from my colleague that he went to JB to get it fix and only cost him RM$200+. I'm actually wondering whether what is the different....(come with 3 yrs warrantly also).<br><br>I'm getting my Madza 2 end of this month and my home parking are without shelter.That's the reason why I'm try to source a cheaper range of solar film.</div>
