            <div class='col-md body'><p>Need some advice here. Met with an unfortunate car accident last year and it was a collision.no major injury but standard mc for both parties. However as incident occurred at junction, now received court attendance notice for 2 counts of charges. 1) fail to confirm to traffic lights 2) careless driving. Total demerit points 12/6 pts respectively indicated on the letter with no other mention of compound fine. Total 18 points.Clean driving records . Has anyone encountered this and will my license will revoked or suspended ? Seek your kind advice and haven't been resting well for this issue. A stupid mistake on my part, determined to exercise due diligence always whenever I drive. Spoke to the IO at TP that did my statement , briefly mentioned this 2 counts of charges and just asked me don't worry too much and be careful in future upon viewing my past records.however , can't help but how not to worry.Does anyone has similar experience n how probable will the court writ the charges up further?in pain now, as I'm not sure if my future employment will be affected by the charges. Can anyone advice me on procedure and will there be a good chance for appeal to TP to grant absence from court but a heavier fine instead?</p></div>

I know that there is camera at that junction for people going from pasir ris drive 12 to tampines ave 10, but is there a camera on tpe exit. Please help me.

              Bro.. now worries. As long as there is NO FLASH, means you are safe. A little out of the line is ok.. For old red light camera, there is 2 flash. New ones, only one. Probation drivers have 12 points for the 1st year. The penalty for beating red light is 12 points + $200 fine. Rightfully, after the offence, you have no points. But you are still safe. Once you hit 13, goodbye to your license. 
              
              But from what I see, you did not get caught. Just wait a couple of weeks for any letter or physically check on TP website.
              
              Relax.. everything will be ok

              <p>Ok as new user unable to open a new thread. </p>
              <p>i am also seeking advice, I am charged with dangerous driving 24 pts.</p>
              <p>I was turning on junction waited for an old lady pass my front, moved only after she cleared my path, while passing through I saw her falling down on the road.</p>
              <p>Stopped immediately to assist her, she was alright except broken wrist sustained due to fall. Helped her to drive SGH at her request waited until her family member arrived and left. Later contacted by her family members accusing me to hit her and informed that they would lodging a police report.</p>
              <p>Now I am charged with Dangerous driving, I hired a lawyer who wrote to police for viewing video and ladies medical reports. Now prosecutor  is saying they do not have video, not willing to share medical report (saying irrelivent means wouldn't support their version), and there is no witness as we'll.</p>
              <p>I am wondering how could they charge me with such a weak case, I think I could defend this one in the court but that would cost me $$$ which I am unable recover.</p>
              <p>Any advice is highly appreciated.</p>

              Bro, under the court letter.. is there any section which says that you can plead guilty via ATOMS so that you don't need to go to court?
              
              The problem here is that.. you were caught driving without road tax. LTA regulations state that you have up to 7 days from your road tax expiry date to display the new valid disc.. and not 7 days buffer to drive car without valid road tax. Moreover, you were caught in the act. I am sorry but it seems like you have to explain your case in front of the judge. 
              
              If your road tax was renewed but awaiting them to post to you when you were stopped by the road block, you would have gotten away without any issues.
              
              Why did you drive the car in the first place since you know road tax expired?
              Lesson to learn.. if you want to drive without road tax, there are some places and roads you should avoid.. and avoid driving late night after 12am on Fridays Saturdays.
