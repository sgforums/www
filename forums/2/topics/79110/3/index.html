            <div class='col-md body'>anyway to point out and surmarise all points, stock WRX is is slower than stock EVO, if we took the STi, we'd have to pit it against the MR, and currently its unknown who would emerge in front, but my personal guess would be the EVO, based on comparing the base WRX and base EVO models.<br>if we were to talk about those silly high powered Rexes, it seems most rex lovers simply pit it against the base EVO, which is simply unfair. the spec Cs n all that should be pitted against the FQ330, and the rest of those specials like Litchfield T25s n what nots, ought to go up against those highly tuned EVOs. and in each battle, i can tell u what the outcome would be. even the Prodrive version of the Rex, the PPP, lost to the FQ300 during shootouts. EVOs are, if u take models on an equivalent model, such as base evo to bas rex, STi to MR and so on, always faster, higher powered, and somehow more hardcore. it electronic controls systems are much more sophiscated and advanced, and the EVO often wins shootouts against the rex. the EVO is the only car besides the mightly Lancias to have won the WRC driver's championship 4 years in a row. the only advantage i see for the WRX is its affordability.</div>

EVOs are, if u take models on an equivalent model, such as base evo to bas rex, STi to MR and so on, always faster, higher powered, and somehow more hardcore. it electronic controls systems are much more sophiscated and advanced, and the EVO often wins shootouts against the rex. the EVO is the only car besides the mightly Lancias to have won the WRC driver's championship 4 years in a row. the only advantage i see for the WRX is its affordability.</div></blockquote>Hey hey hey ... there is this import tuner mag in the petrol kiosk sometime ago ... i browsed it and it shows a Challange page ....

Subaru win in bringing a commercial rally car to road first.<br><br>5. No choice, what... evos were whopping the scoobies' butt all the time... hahah... more exciting car? ok... funan centre is selling the may 2004 of best motoring... MR vs V-limited. Look at the gymkana and the race. Thank goodness for something called in-car camera. Look at the hands of the evo drivers' vis-a-vis the drivers in the scooby.<br><br>Anyway, this is the first time I heard an evo is worse off at cornering compared to a wrx. A conversation with a PI last year about the Spec-C and the E8 about the pros and the cons. He told me that the Spec-C has a greater tendency for oversteer, the E8, unfortunately, due to its AYC and ACD is a more boring car... try as you may, the tail is diffy to whip out. So conclusion from PI? You want fun on track - Spec-C. You want fast on track - E8. oh BTW, PI said he would get an E8 but unfortunately he only had the Spec-C. That to me was objective enuff - oh, btw, I dunno the PI, he was just having a smoke break in front of the Spec-C that he was trying to sell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But like you said, this argument can go on till the cows come home - its called rivalry. Porsches vs ferraris, etc... I guess I wanna learn more about the scoobies and all interesting lah...<br><br>Can someone tell me why the scoobie's boxer engine has the distinct thumping sound?

Not true. when your cars get involved in a low speed accident and the driver can get killed even belted up, clearly there is a weakness in the structural integrity somewhere. and rally cars pay even more attention to safety than normal cars due to the nature of their usage, so how can u say neither the STi nor EVO was built with safety as a priority? furthermore, remember these cars have to meet the minimum FIA safety standards, which are very very high, higer than that for normal road cars.<br><br>3. the way i see it, subaru ain't looking so good right now either in WRC. top 3 cars are arguably the Ford, Citroen then Peugeot(in order) and i think u may have forgotten, but subaru sure ain't the best now. and mitsu wasn't in rallying longer than subaru. i'd say they both started the same time, although to be honest, records i've found indicates that subaru may have actually rallied longer than mitsu.<br><br>4. both the EVO and WRX were meant to be rally cars for the road, so going by your reasoning: "you can't compare "stock" cars for the simple reason that they were manufactured with different commercial motivations." i would say it is entirely fair to compare them stock.<br><br>5. i hardly think more variations means more exciting. because ultimately there are so many mod brands doing these cars and trying to outdo each other with 800bhp, 1000bhp monsters, i don't see any point in judging the vehicles by the number of variations available. i'd look at potential instead.</div>
