It's workshop bread and butter.<br>You have to service between every 5000km and 10000km, coz you have to at least chnage the engine oil and engine oil filter during this interval if you wanna keep your engine in good condition. You will have a choice of mineral engine oil, which is cheaper but have to change every 5000 - 6000km. Or you can choose synthetic engine oil, more expensive, but you need to change only about every 10000km. Each time you go for such servcing, just tell the workshop any problems you have with the car.<br><br>If you have the car manual, there should be a table inside that sez what to inspect / replace at which interval. Else, if you don't have the manual, you can let us know which car you are drivin and the bros here will direct you to a forum where you can really get answers for your specific car and maintenance for it.<br><br>As for cost, there's 2 components to everything. Cost of part and cost of labour.<br>If you know what you want, say engine oil, you can keep an eye out for a good lobang on these forums, buy it and bring it down to<br>workshop and just pay for the labour.<br>If you go down to the workshop empty-handed, synthetic oil + oil filter + labour may cost about<br>80 - 120, excluding other stuff that may be wrong with your car.<br><br>Hope this helps, and sorry to hear about your dad  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
