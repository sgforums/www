            <div class='col-md body'>Swenn, I suppose the problem lies with the instructor more then it lies with you. Driving is something that takes a lot of practice, time and experience to get used to. It is very normal for a new driver to feel confuse and loss when trying manipulate something he/she is not familiar. Situation will be even worse if there is person beside you keep scolding you. The more you get scolded, the more you will be de-moralized, and the worse you will perform.  It you are taking a driving course from driving school, suggest that you check with the clerk if you can change to another more patient instructor. If you are learning from some private instructor, fire him and get another one. As a general guide for novice driver, try to adapt the following habits when making a turn.<br><br>1) Always check your blind spot before you turn. Look out for<br>motorcyclist.<br><br>2) Try to turn slowly and adjust your wheel accordingly. If there's a<br>vehicle infront of you, try to stay inline with that car and position<br>your car with it.<br><br>3) For now, do not change gear when you turn. Change it only<br>after you finished the turn.<br><br>4) Release the wheel gently. The car will self centre by itself.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's true lah, sometimes it's quite unbearable to what the instructor says, but in fact those that are strict and uses harsh remarks are some what like testers' standard. The 1st test I took, I kanna critised by the tester until like dunno wat.<br><br>Then I just passed my practical yesterday, 6 points, partly think thanks to all the criticisms I received, so the main thing is to take it easy, take in all the learning points and leave out the harsh words</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few tips for BBDC students  I dunno if this helps but just sharing . This tips was given to me by my instructor years back ...<br><br>1. The zebra corssing just infront of the MOTORCYCLE TRAINING AREA  ... Remember to keep a lookout<br><br>2. The mini yellow box infront of reverse parking number 31. From traffic light stopline to yellow box , if you are coming straight from the slope , you can stop just infront of the stopline but if you are coming out frlp reverse parking lot 35 or 31 do not enter the yellow box if the traffic light is RED<br><br>3.Reverse parking lot number 45  . If you are coming out from this parking lot , don't be afraid that you are making a wide turning to the crank course area as even if you full lock your steering wheel , you can't get iinto the left lane.<br><br>4. Turning out to main road from motorcycle training area . TAKE NOTE NOT TO CROSS THE WHITE PAINT DIVIDER<br><br>going out now ... come back the edit and continue  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
