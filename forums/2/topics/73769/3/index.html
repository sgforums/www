I am lucky to meet a nice tester (Mr Chua).  I striked the kerb in S course, a stupid mistake, 10 points lost.  Later on the road, I also made several mistakes.   I thought that I would surely fail.  On the way going back to BBDC, he said: you are not a good driver, you only know how to speed up, do not know how to slow down.<br><br>I was so nervous until going back to the office.  He concluded "well done" and asked me how many courses I have taken, then gave me 18 points and let me pass.  I felt that I was raised to heaven from hell suddenly.  totally like a dream.  Both my instructor and I were afaid that I will fail since I committed the mistake in the circuit.<br><br></div>
