So don't worry about this. I used to freak out and feel sad when i'm having a bad driving day or have a lousy instructor. The thing is you must trust you own judgement sometimes. YOU are the one who is driving, cannot always listen to what the person beside tell you what to do. It all boils down to the amount of driving experience you have, the more you drive, the more you get better. Don't let one session of lesson demoralize you.

First time got axed because a bike move off suddenly while i was making a turn (you know how bikes like to stop at the side inside the circuit and listen to instructor talk) Second time was nearing traffic light (still at green this time), turn red and i had to come to a sudden halt coz someone step out onto the road suddenly~ Sigh~ so in my opinion when taking the test, drill into ur brain the word "SAFETY" and hope you're lucky that day....

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun worry too much, after all driving is mean to been enjoyed.... If you are too tensed then you will make alot of mistakes..... You will never have 100% error free..... that's why they have the demerit points system as a guage..... If you think that going for more lessons help go for it..... dun worry it is better to spend more then to regret later.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is the starters woes. Everybody whom learn how to drive will face similar problems. The extent of it is base on the individual ability to coordinate  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  the hands the legs well.<br><br>I agree with going for more lessons. Practice makes perfect. Keep cool &amp; most important don't panick. Its not easy &amp; I know it very well myself. I am one of those super sotong ones that can even mix up between left &amp; right turn.<br><br>Don't be scared turning the steering wheel. There are no hard &amp; fast rules making a filter lane turn must full lock steering or not. Very dependent on personal judgement. Car can move slow but steering need to be efficient. No one can fault you driving slowly. You are just being careful.<br><br>Moreover you have the BIG L  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> plate in front &amp; behind. On the road who cares if you stall in front of the traffic light, its alright  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> . Just step on your brakes, place gear to neutral &amp; start engine to move on again...<br><br>Take care &amp; enjoy.</div>
