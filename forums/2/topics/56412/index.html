            <div class='col-md body'>wah lau... the everlasting Integra vs the rest of the cars debate. the only fact the Integra seems so good is becos of its image to its strong fan base, which is most of u out there. While its not a bad car, its not a wonderful car either. And its definately overpriced. With a 0-100 of 7.6s, there are wuite a host of cars priced the same or cheaper which can beat it. The ITR is not about speed. Its about image. AND the Type R badge. I guess to the fan base, it holds some emotions for them. The same reason swirls around the Prancing Horse badge. The cheaper Porsches are much faster, but, the image accounts for much.</div>

I can only think of one car cheaper then it that can beat that kinda 0-100 and thats the rex. what other cars got huh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>no offence, but i think that theres been enough discrimination for a car that really shines in many aspects of performance but has been given a bad review by i quote "some" ppl that simply go overboard in their need to prove a point.</div>
