              ridiculous demand.... if this is the case, i rather be one of the free rider than be the driver....
              
              yeah at most pick up at one spot at my timing....
              
              pay me? sounds fair but always turn out to be not good.... cos if pay too little, waste time and driver still expected to serve... if pay too much, colleagues think driver $ minded....
              
              best is to reject with an excuse... e.g. not sure which day not driving... need to send some family member to work first...
              
              think of it this way... i am 200% sure if either of the female colleagues bought a car, she will not offer pick up...

              <p>Anyway, maybe its okay to send the collegues to their doors this once.  Just so as to let the collegues fulfilled their excuses to want to sit once in someone's new car.</p>
              <p>But subsequently.  The owner of the car must learn to work late 'cos have to feed the car'.  'appointments with clients'; 'pick g/f up'; 'pick mother to send her somewhere' and have 'early dinner appointments somewhere' to kill off the habits of these kinda parasite collegues.</p>
