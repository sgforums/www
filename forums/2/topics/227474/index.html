            <div class='col-md body'>For all people who have been asking about Petrol grades and octane numbers. Here's the answer.<br><br>Hopefully mods make this a sticky.<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:7bc9364e934bf010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:7bc9364e934bf010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD</a><br><br><blockquote><br>Dec 25, 2006<br>Higher-octane petrol does not give more power<br><br>I REFER to the letter, 'Rein in pump prices and polluting fuels' by Mr Hwang Liang Keng (ST, Dec 19). Mr Hwang mentioned that California laws prohibit the sale of petrol with an octane level higher than 91.<br><br>The octane number is actually an imprecise measure of the maximum compression ratio at which a particular fuel can be burned in an engine without pre-detonation. There are actually two numbers - RON (research octane number) and MON (motor octane number). The RON simulates fuel performance under low severity engine operation. The MON simulates more severe operation that may be incurred at high speed or high load and can be as much as 10 points lower than the RON.<br><br>In Singapore, the number at petrol pumps is the RON. However, in the United States, it usually indicates 'mean' octane number, that is, (RON + MON)/2, or the average of both the RON and the MON. This is why there is an apparent discrepancy between octane values of petrol in the US and the rest of the world. For example, RON95 unleaded in Singapore is 95 octane but equivalent to American (RON+MON)/2 89 octane.<br><br>In the US, low-altitude petrol stations typically sell three grades of petrol with octane ratings of 87, 89 and 91. High-altitude stations typically also sell three grades, but with lower values - 85, 87 and 89. This is because, for every 300m increase in altitude, the RON value goes down by 0.5.<br><br>It is also a common misconception among car enthusiasts that higher octane means more power. This is simply not true. The myth arose because high-performance vehicles require higher-octane fuels. Without understanding why, a certain section of the car subculture decided this was because<br><br>higher-octane petrol means higher power.<br><br>The reality is a little different. Power is limited by the maximum amount of fuel-air mixture that can be jammed into the combustion chamber. Because high-performance engines operate with high compression ratios, they are more likely to suffer from detonation. And so to compensate, they need a higher-octane fuel to control the burn.<br><br>So yes, sports cars do need high-octane fuel, but it is not because the octane rating somehow gives more power. High-octane fuel is required because the engine develops more power because of its design.<br><br>Huang Yu-kang</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lower ron petrol is usually higher in sulphur which is a poison to the catalysts in the catalytic converters, hence emissions tends to be higher ie NOx SOx...but higher ron petrol is high in aromatics and benzene which again are carcinogenic compounds...but we are moving towards clean fuels which calls for euro4 standards (which are currently being implemented for diesel)...so in the future, sulphur content of gasoline will be only 50ppm and benzene level no more than 1vol%...<br><br>but as for performance wise...a high ron will not increase performance, but you can tune you engine more agressively if you pump a higher ron petrol...and hence better performance...<br><br>and there is no such thing as a pure petrol!! gasoline is basically a blend of many refinery products...</div>
