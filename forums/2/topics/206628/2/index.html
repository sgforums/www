            <div class='col-md body'>I think the main reason for high speeding of vehicles and races in signaproe are partly attributed to the fact that singaporean are nt very exposed to the motorsports scene as well as the abscent of a suitable race track for them to put their performances machine to good use.<br>[say m'sa but hw many wuld wan to travel all the way there after a whole week of work]<br><br>it makes many quite suan ku and hence they find it thrilling to fluant their cars on the roads</div>

While we're at that, maybe we should also ban cheap cigarettes and alcohol and only allow the finest Cuban cigars and VSOPs!</div>
