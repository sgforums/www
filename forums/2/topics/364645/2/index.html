              K20a.</p>
              <p>B-series is definitely a raw and powerful engine and is good
              still today and is still a superb platform. But K20a has reached
              heights that the B can't touch, even if its B20 if you wanna
              compare cc.</p>
              <p>There is a 400whp NA (not turbo) K20 build. B-series can't touch
              that.</p>
              <p>My friend used to own one of the yellow DC2s; still a nice car.
              Rare and very JDM but they are getting rarer.</p>

              <p>In my honest opinion, those who are able to do such things (import exotics from overseas, etc) must have a certain level of financial ability. And those with that level of financial ability will go out there and just do it, and not come to forums to ask for advice.</p>
