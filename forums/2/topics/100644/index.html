Giancarlo is certain a very under-rated driver.<br><br>I believe BAR will contiune to perform well with Jensen. Toyota's got a strong pairing, but it's not one i can imagine winning races.<br><br>Jordan is 99% confirmed to continue with a Toyota engine, and highly likely to run Ryan Briscoe in return as part of the deal. Minardi are using their own engines. Do not under-estimate Sauber. They have a strong pairing and a pretty good car.<br><br>The question now is, will McLaren and Williams get their game up? Certainly, if they do, it is going to be one hell of a fight, with the top 6 teams all having Star drivers.<br><br>Btw, Coulthard may go back to Williams instead of Mika. Or Pizziona maybe taking the race drive. Ricardo Zonta while, being more or less out of the racing seat for so long, performed pretty well in many races for toyota when he took over Da Matta's seat.</div>

At the start of the season they weren't so strong. If anything, I would attribue their increase in performance in the later part of the season as being due to the operation of their new wind tunnel.

Although most F1 cars may seem similiar, in particular the F2003GA and the Sauber this year, I can assure you, milimeter differences here and there give them entirely different performances. The only factor I would attribute to Ferrari is the engines, and those engines aren't as powerful as current spec Ferrari engines. If anything, had they gotten a works Cosworth engine this year, with power on par with the Jaguars, I believe they would have done even better. Once again, I must disabuse the notion that the sauber is "simple yet great ferrari chassis" because if it WERE so, they wouldn't have been allowed to take part in this year's F1 championship.</div>

If you consider the fact that Taku had more failures than Button, then certainly driver factor is involved, despite what the team says. Button is known to be very smooth. Taku is less so. You may not know, but driving a car roughly, pushing it too hard, braking later etc, actually subject the crankshaft, engine, etc, to undue stresses. Its not just the engine's temperature increasing and decreasing during a pit. Let me show u a scenario:<br><br>For a certain corner, Button starts braking 5m earlier. He is on the brakes gentler than Taku. He downshifts slightly later to allow for the revs to drop more than Taku does. Taku, because he brakes late, only can start downshifting later. He brakes from a higher speed which means his engine is at a higher RPM, and he has to downshift faster and sooner after he starts braking than Button. At highr RPMs, the engine is subject to more stress. So perhaps for those few seconds of downshifting, he subjects the engine to an extra, say 500RPMs of stress. 500 RPM may not seem like much, but as the RPMs increase, the stress and wear increase in a non-linear fashion. And then add to the fact that there are possibly 5 to 6 such corners in a circuit(not including the fast corners), and the fact that this situation is repeated over and over again. You can see why Taku's engine breaks.<br><br>I am not being unfair in saying that Taku is still too rough on the car. Jacques Villeneuve, 97 F1 champion, is known to be a rough driver as well. When he was with BAR Honda in 03, the same situation was happening, in that he broke more engines than Button did. The key to Sato improving now, is that he actually smoothens his driving out, and he will definately improve.</div>

So this "pit stop" theory is a very "on the surface" look at a problem.<br><br>What i am saying here is that the problem goes beyond that. Sato is very likely exposing the engine to anywhere from 200RPMs to 500RPMs extra worth of stress for each downchange due to his driving style, and that is the more possible and realistic reason for his engine blowing up. Afterall, how would u account for the times his engine blew up and he didn't make any extra pitstops then?</div>

If I were to find a plausable and logical sounding reason, it will be that you need to let the driver have access to high revs because at times like when you are trying to overtake at the end of a straight, they come into play. Also a limitier actually can intefere with driving styles, esp if u keep hitting the limiter. I am sure the F1 reguations do not prevent them from doing so since I have noticed that some cars like McLaren had limiters installed  early on in the season when that piece of a crap mercedes engine kept blowing up. At the higher gears it was usually limited to about 17000 rpms.<br><br>Another reason which would sound plausable would be the powerband and the torque curve of the engine makes it so that to install a limiter hamper the engine somewhat. Then the onus is on the driver to be able to manage the engine RPMs manually.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>watever you and I say does not matter because we are only speculating... none of us is in a better situation then the engineers and mechanics to answer this sort of questions. You and I maybe right or wrong... for goodness sake I dont look at things superficially, I have already considered what the points u brought up even before u posted them.

Have you ever done case studies during sch? Some of the things I say are from case studies I am getting now from my lecturers due to the course I am taking.</div>
