What you have mentioned is only a pretty superficial look at it. If I were to find a plausable and logical sounding reason, it will be that you need to let the driver have access to high revs because at times like when you are trying to overtake at the end of a straight, they come into play. Also a limitier actually can intefere with driving styles, esp if u keep hitting the limiter. I am sure the F1 reguations do not prevent them from doing so since I have noticed that some cars like McLaren had limiters installed  early on in the season when that piece of a crap mercedes engine kept blowing up. At the higher gears it was usually limited to about 17000 rpms.<br><br>Another reason which would sound plausable would be the powerband and the torque curve of the engine makes it so that to install a limiter hamper the engine somewhat. Then the onus is on the driver to be able to manage the engine RPMs manually.</div></blockquote>Uhhh, Heng, you seem to have missed the obvious here: the over-revving is occurring, but it's not upon acceleration - it's upon downshifting.<br><br>Keep in mind that one of the regulation changes this year (the set which was suppposed to have been introduced in the middle of last year but which were delayed) include the banning of automatic downshifting.<br><br>Rev limiters operate by limiting the number of firing cylinders - the loss of power prevents further increase of revs.  However, when downshifting, what affects the revs is not the engine power (since fuel has been decreased by a closed throttle) but the torsional force transmitted to the crankshaft from the wheels via the driveshaft.  The result: even with minimal fuel, the wheels turning at 100 MPH are still going to keep the engine at 17000 rpm in third gear (or 18700 at 110 MPH!).  That's where your overreving is coming from, and rev limiters are of no use here.<br><br>Automatic downshifting would have attenuated for this problem, but since they've been banned, forget that one.  Drivers downshifting too quickly will break their engines.</div>

Drivers downshifting too quickly will break their engines.</div></blockquote>Ged! heyyy man hows ya. guess wad, I haven't missed that the overevving occurs during downshifting. check out this post earlier in the thread. its the 11th post here, when i talked about the difference between button and sato during downshifting:<br><br><strong>"</strong><blockquote><strong>Originally posted by V1NS@niTY:<br>[b]nah... i think takuma sato is the best still... his hasnt  driven the most races but his record so far already eclipses most of his predecessors before him. Engine failure is usually due to an engineers fault not the driver, though it must be said Takuma is a real fearless driver and a real treat to watch. I'm sure you have noticed that he takes all overtaking opportunities although he still lacks the experience to do them properly. He has had only about 8 years worth of competitive motor racing which is really remarkable. Primarily because of his daring and a bit careless style of driving... he pushes the car a bit too hard sometimes and therefore has to pit to rectify damage done. Because the engine has to deal with the sudden increase and decrease in performance during pitting.. some analyst said that the engine could not take it and therefore blew up. Others say however that BAR has been testing experimental technology on Sato's car. For example, BAR won an award this year for implementing the first ever composite gear box... Nevertheless, Takuma has a lot of potential and can only get better from now on.. </strong></blockquote><strong><br>hmm but remember most of his predecessor did not have a good team like he does now.<br><br>And I've got a nasty suprise for you but engine failure CAN be due to the driver's fault. If you consider the fact that Taku had more failures than Button, then certainly driver factor is involved, despite what the team says. Button is known to be very smooth. Taku is less so. You may not know, but driving a car roughly, pushing it too hard, braking later etc, actually subject the crankshaft, engine, etc, to undue stresses. Its not just the engine's temperature increasing and decreasing during a pit. Let me show u a scenario:<br><br>For a certain corner, Button starts braking 5m earlier. He is on the brakes gentler than Taku. He downshifts slightly later to allow for the revs to drop more than Taku does. Taku, because he brakes late, only can start downshifting later. He brakes from a higher speed which means his engine is at a higher RPM, and he has to downshift faster and sooner after he starts braking than Button. At highr RPMs, the engine is subject to more stress. So perhaps for those few seconds of downshifting, he subjects the engine to an extra, say 500RPMs of stress. 500 RPM may not seem like much, but as the RPMs increase, the stress and wear increase in a non-linear fashion. And then add to the fact that there are possibly 5 to 6 such corners in a circuit(not including the fast corners), and the fact that this situation is repeated over and over again. You can see why Taku's engine breaks.<br><br>I am not being unfair in saying that Taku is still too rough on the car. Jacques Villeneuve, 97 F1 champion, is known to be a rough driver as well. When he was with BAR Honda in 03, the same situation was happening, in that he broke more engines than Button did. The key to Sato improving now, is that he actually smoothens his driving out, and he will definately improve."</strong></div>
