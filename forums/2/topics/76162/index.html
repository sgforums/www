            <div class='col-md body'>some drivers have really horrible mentality. try to ignore and don't get angry with anyone when driving. It will cause you to do reckless things that you will definately regret later. In the end ask yourself is it worth being angry.<br><br>well if you are definately not a career racer or not going to earn any money from racing, try driving carefully and slowly(but not snail). Signal early then change lanes. It does not matter if others wanna be bastard, as long as you keep yourself safe.<br><br>On the long run, real skill is not getting into any accidents for the next 30 years of your driving life. Skill is not going fast and switching lanes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this also reminds me... last time i was about to turn into a filter lane heading towards bedok interchange, den this son of a *** taxi just cut into my lane(left) and just stopped there, apparently he was ferrying an indecisive customer who couldn't get his directions right. i horned the hell out of the cabby. had to wait before i could filter right to overtake him coz got alot of cars at that time. den i drive past him he still got the guts to stare at me. these cabbies always think they are some big shots driving a diesel car. they don't realize that their reckless driving can lead to accidents, and when that happen and they got no cab to drive, they can only live on their big ego for a living.</div>
