Another friend of mine bought the car at $42,999 in Jan got freebies like; alarm + central locking, reserve sensor, Angbao lucky draw (which she won something like $288 cash) and she also got RikeCool solar film for FREE!!! I can introduce that agent if you PM me... Anyway, buying from the right agent makes a difference between getting your car fast or slow...<br><br>I bought my car in May 2004 at $49,999... NO FREEBIES... just a shopping voucher from the lucky draw at the road show. Collected it about 2 months plus later...<br><br>The car is superb... very fuel efficient and has quite a torque for a little car. The rest is history... I don't need to say more... you can search the forum or visit <a href="http://www.sgkiaclub.com" rel="nofollow">www.sgkiaclub.com</a> for more info. on the Picanto.<br><br>Hmm... do understand that the Picanto is really a very basic car, that's why not even central locking and alarm were included. Also, no AIR BAGs, ABS and power window for rear passenagers. The sound proofing is quite bad, thus the noisy cabin noise when travelling... BUT... all these can be done up later... the main deal here is... you take the basic... and add what you need/desire. That's how I see it...<br><br>Hope this helps...<br>Vincent</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I hope i am not wrong here but believe the COE will dropped. Maybe in one or two coming bids............<br><br>The reason being, car price has rise, and watcher like me will stay put at this moment and will not be tempted to buy a car. Why? For example, if i do not want to buy a kia picanto at 40500, will i be willing to pay 42999? Of cos not..... so i will stay put and see how the COE goes from here. Unless for people who needs car urgently, else, all will stay put at this moment.<br><br>Also, another factor is that the interest rate had rise........ and just like my 1st theory, it will put some people off.<br><br>Once the backlog for orders starts to clear, the COE will dropped for sure, dispite being having less COE. However, this will also mean to say that once the car price dropped, and that you don't go in again to buy a car, the price will definitely rise for sure! So my view is, go for it!!!! Its a matter of supply and demand.<br><br>Anyway new COE will be out soon, so lets take a look at them. All the above is just my personal view, and hope i am right. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  cheers~!</div>
