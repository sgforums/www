Someone told me the Tucson was conceptualised and meant for the North American market while Kia was meant for the Asian.<br><br>To me, the real difference lies in the cost of maintainance.  Tucson sells by sheer numbers and invariably parts are cheaper and readily available.  Kia is distributed by C &amp; C, the people that brings you Mercedes and they are not noted for cheaper parts and servicing.  Again speak to the people that owns these two models and you'll get a better picture.</div>

If you are the type that only goes to work and come back home straight without picking up ur wife, son etc. it'll be ok. He spent at least $400++ on fuel itself. Now change to Forester...although turbocharged, it has even better fuel consumption that tucson.
