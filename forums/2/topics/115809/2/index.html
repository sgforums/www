Usually we find that the driver is at fault because 50% of us don't obey speed limit rules on small raods. Thus the driver who have already being speeding, will definitely be wrong no matter what.<br><br>But argument about a possible blind spot (bushes, parked lorry, vans), reckless dashing of jay-walkings will still stand to pardon the driver or lessen his sentences.</div>
