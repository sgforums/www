I saw today classified Honda Civic type R open for booking @ $106k, but dun think it suit yr needs.<br>Go for a family car instead, get a $100k car and you have $60k to spend for the misc and petrol which leave u less headache. IS250 is a drinker tho it look nice, heard some owner sell it after just few mth only.<br>Just be humble and look for something average will do. Car here in Sg is over rated, I dun think it worth the $$ on it, as long as it dun give u problem and break down.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>160K i personnally think get a europian car due to its safety aspect and it is more worth it i think. dun compare taxi fare to car cost, some ppl use their very frequently like going out or so, imagine that u go out with family or friends after school or weekends, car might be a better choice due to time wasted on waiting for public transport and if you go out with ur family and your grandma or dad around, u would very much wan them to enjoy the journey instead of squeezing in a packed bus or mrt right? if everyday take cab 3-4 times each cost $15, $1200 a month, but if u dun drive that often then safe the 160K for future use.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys,<br><br>Just test drove(or my dad rather,I'm still a P plate<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ) the VW golf gti today at the showroom near leng kee there.<br><br>And boy did it leave a deep impression on me. First thing that greeted me while awaiting the car at the main entrance was hearing the bassy note of the exhaust. The test car was a 5 door gti. so i hopped on to the back while hearing the SE go on and on about the safety aspects of the car and boy was it power packed.<br><br>Acceleration in the car was extremely linear for a turbo engine. no feeling of turbo lag at all. i think its due to the fact that a smaller turbo unit was fitted. okay anyways my as the car has the ability to be semi automatic, my dad decided to be abit more adventurous and try out its handling. gear changes out of bends was extremely smooth, lol felt almost as though the car was invincible enough to beat a subaru WRX(of course its not  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ). Wind noise at speeds is quite low. haha the only noise that enters the cabin is that of the 2.0l engine and the turbo roar during hard acceleration which was pure bliss. The car could do with a better exhaust system though, and the sound would be even more perfect.<br><br>I think i give this car a 7.3/10.<br><br></div>
