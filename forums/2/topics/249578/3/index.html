It stole my heart the very 1st moment I test drove it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by WhamBamTyMam:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey guys,<br><br>Just test drove(or my dad rather,I'm still a P plate<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ) the VW golf gti today at the showroom near leng kee there.<br><br>And boy did it leave a deep impression on me. First thing that greeted me while awaiting the car at the main entrance was hearing the bassy note of the exhaust. The test car was a 5 door gti. so i hopped on to the back while hearing the SE go on and on about the safety aspects of the car and boy was it power packed.<br><br>Acceleration in the car was extremely linear for a turbo engine. no feeling of turbo lag at all. i think its due to the fact that a smaller turbo unit was fitted. okay anyways my as the car has the ability to be semi automatic, my dad decided to be abit more adventurous and try out its handling. gear changes out of bends was extremely smooth, lol felt almost as though the car was invincible enough to beat a subaru WRX(of course its not  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ). Wind noise at speeds is quite low. haha the only noise that enters the cabin is that of the 2.0l engine and the turbo roar during hard acceleration which was pure bliss. The car could do with a better exhaust system though, and the sound would be even more perfect.<br><br>I think i give this car a 7.3/10.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the TS doesn't need a car urgently, why not wait for the Volvo S40 T5 facelift? Since the car is going to be used by the whole family, it makes more sense to get a larger car than the GTi (esp if the family is selling the Odyssey away). The Volvo isn't as attention grabbing as the other conti makes around that price range, and it provides a pretty good drive and comfortable interior. Plus it looks fabulous inside and out imho  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  You want safety? Well it's a Volvo. WHo knows? You may prefer the sound of the TC 5 cylinder. Power is not too shabby also, with 230bhp (facelifted one).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly I think the novelty of owning a cabrio will wear off after a while. If I have one, I doubt I will ever drive topless (not literally) due to the unpredictable local weather. And I am not even going into the issue of smelling the exhaust of diesel vehicles.

What if TS's dad has enough money to buy, say a car that's worth $500,000, but decides to lower the budget to $160k. Isnt that considered trying to save money too? And don't you think that it's not what car you actually drive that's attention-seeking(excluding the exotic lambos and ferraris etc.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">), but what you do with the car?
