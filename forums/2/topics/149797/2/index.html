            <div class='col-md body'>First off, you're a P plate holder. Secondly, there were no eye witness to say who was in the wrong. Thirdly, the Traffic Police will likely doubt your account, that the pick up driver didn't stop.<br><br>As a personal opinion, being a P plate holder, you should be more watchful of others, especially those bluddy pickups or lorries delivering gas cylinders; they are always in a rush, and are mostly impatient and reckless. When I see one in front or behind me, I'd give him plenty room to pass by or let him go first. Always anticipate other people's poor judgement, or bad driving habits. NEVER, EVER, ASSUME!<br><br>I see alot of P platers driving like they own the roads; speeding, cutting in and out of lanes, turning in or out without signalling, and tailgating.<br><br>You probably now have a tough case to fight.</div>

It'l more likely to be based on many underlying factors. Hence, if in the first place u need a 'barometer' to 'calculate' the percentage of damage to be bonded by either drivers, it jus means: things are not so clear cut and hence you cant exactly say 'wannabe is liable to 10-20%, or lorry will be liable to 90% etc...it all depends.
