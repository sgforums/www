            <div class='col-md body'>Simple. Go make a police report and see if it is possible for you to charge him for road rage. I do hope that you managed to get his number plate down. Include in your report details of his language of course. This case will be handled by police if i'm not wrong, not TP. Then report another case to TP regarding this incident, how he did not stop at stop line and caused an accident.</div>

It'll be nice if you've a pic on the scene of accident. He come out from minor road and hit a car from major road, clearly his fault. And the pt on reporting to poice, you can forget abt it as they wont ldo anything unless there's injuries.<br><br>However, when insurance is left to settle the payments, it's your word against his. So it's best to come to some form of agreement. Call him with confidence, tell him he's in the wrong, and see wad he says. He's clearly trying to scare you by calling you and acting fierce. Scare him. Tell him the seriousness of it when he lose the case and have to claim from his insurance, as I suppose he's driving a company vehicle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my mum got into an accident a few mths back a suntec.<br>no one hurt, just a bruised ego and a jammed door.<br><br>in the end, we took pics (close up) of the door, photos of the accident road(both overview and zoomed in pics of the lane markings plus the directional arrows), pics from the co-driver seat(closest perspective to the driver's)<br><br>suggestion, take those pics during early morning, because then little cars, so it;s easier to see lane markings etc, and also for yr case, the tyre marks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>talk to the lorry driver. tell him if he wanna fight this case hard via insurance, he also won't win hands down. since he wanna fight his words against yours, go against him.<br><br>tell him, you push the case up to TP, and he risk losing points and perhaps his lifelihood. let tp go see the pics and tyre marks, and decide if you were really speeding. then see if he'd back down on a settlement with you. in any case, if he got no tyre marks, then it's obvious he didn't slow down or brake well enough to avoid you.<br><br>i got into a major accident back in '99, driving a 14 footer lorry, and collided with a old panel van (i was doing near 70 on west coast highway). the panel van disintegrated, but the driver recovered. tp got involved, and after a big round of investigations, the panel van was at fault. i didn't get penalised for anythin at all. simply because i'm driving straight in the junction, and he failed to give way when makin his turn from the opposite road. my tyre marks also left a huge trail on the road.<br><br>but drive carefully next time, there are some lorry drivers who drive as if they own the roads.</div>

Judging from the pics, the left side of your car seemed to take the most impact and you said you hit the lorry's right side bumper so he was probably 1/4 out of the lane already? IMHO, I never like to drive on the extreme left lane if the road is clear due to such drivers with big balls thinking that the major road cars will either slow down for them or go onto other lanes.</div>
