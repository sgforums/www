            <div class='col-md body'>I am looking for below 50k mid-sized sedan, with good fuel comsumption and<br>annually maintance fee.  and these models caught my attention:<br>Mitsubishi Lancer,  toyota vios, nissan sunny, and Chervolet Aveo.<br>I am quite interested in Chervolet Aveo, the price is lowest, MT only 45900,<br>the size is bigger than vios,  and the new sedan model just launched last month.<br>But it seems not too many Aveo cars on the road,  I think to keep maintanance cost lower, there should be a big pool of users, to support more parts dealers in the market.<br>I search LTA, and find this report Chervolet market share is quite small.<br>but it shows Chervolet only enter Singapore market since 2003? is this true?<br>if so, it looks like Chervolet still done a quite good job in their first 3 years, compare with other make's first 3 years performance, some make, like Subaru, put in millions in the advertising, after so many years, the market share even lower than 3 year's Chervolet, maybe Subaru advertising cost too much, can not reduce the price?<br>here is the report.
