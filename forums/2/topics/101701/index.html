            <div class='col-md body'>tested the cvt lancer (same as cvt Vtec city).<br><br>power - lancer slightly sluggish.<br>city is doing ok considering it is only 1.5 to Lancer's 1.6<br><br>noise insulation - Lancer is really noisy even on gentle rev.<br><br>interior - Lancer beats City. City is a bit dull with the grey features.<br><br>i choosed city over lancer cos of the city's ultraseat arrangement.<br>i needed this for my work, to carry long bulky stuffs without using the roof racks.<br><br>overall, i'm happy with the city plus this vtec-ing !!<br><br>average FC for Vtec auto is about 14-15 km/L.<br>dun forget the cheaper road tax too !<br><br>look beyond it's shape.<br>hope u make a good choice as my opinion may defers from urs</div>

Resale value i guess should be better too compared to the City which has a more budget car, scaled-down-Civic sort of image, in my opinion.<br><br>No question abt it..

            <div class='col-md body'>Notice there are not many Lancer on the road compared to the City but there are more Vios compared to City. Facts speak for themselves. Either something is wrong with the new Lancer or the rest are more value for money or better performance.<br><br>City has the ultra seat, flat reat floor, great FC, idsi and vtec. Agree the rear design opinion is polarised but you can add a rear spolier or outfit with Mugen bodykit. It's not as popular as the Vios and is a bit more expensive but then its for those who do not want to be in the main stream, flocking to buy what the rest are buying. High tech stuf and the only one with CVT and steermatic, ABS, SRS, EBD, in this category. The City was 'conceived' in Thai and it was imported into Japan. That shows the quality standard and confidence Honda has, knowing the demands and expectation of its own domestic market.<br><br>Vios is popluar and its VVTI engine (I heard) gives good torgue and performance. SRS, ABS are standard. Cabin wise is a tad lower than City and the central metre dash layout is subjective. Cabin space feels smaller than City. Its a safe choice, what with Toyota name backing it up.<br><br>Go test drive all 3 cars and make your choice. You got to feel good with the seating, the cabin layout, the performance. Bring along friends and get their feedback, sitting at the back about the space, noise and general comfort. Forget about whether it is Thai or Jap made. What matters is how much it will cost you. Whether it is Thai, Malaysia, Japan, Africa, everything is sourced and made global now and the technical know how and quality management is the same as if made in Japan. The Thai plants are staffed by Japanese QA and technician, leading the production. China plants also the same.</div>

Just my 2 cents worth.</div></blockquote>Think you should be comparing the Lancer to the Sunny 1.6EX as both are priced similarly and are in the same class.<br><br>The City certainly has a more versatile cabin compared to the Vios (which it's often compared with) with its flexible split-folding rear ULTRAseats. However, it's exterior styling is more avant-garde and may not appeal to more conservative car buyers. It has a LOW rear floor like the Jazz - the one with completely FLAT floor is the Civic and Stream. Go for the VTEC version (f you can afford it)as it comes with more power, ABS, 2SRS &amp; 15" wheels unlike the cheaper i-DSI version which has slightly better fuel economy though.<br><br>Don't go for the Vios if you don't wanna be seen driving the same car as everyone else, as is the case for most Toyotas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Accutually u guys never see into the electronic power steering aand stuff. These things that use up battery water instead of the engine power would give the more power on the wheels. Anyway, i oso dun know why ppl like mitsubitshi lancer.......... MAyb for its looks i can give 10/10 compared to the other cars of its type... its engine Mivec if i'm not wrong doesn't save as much oil as the vtec or vvt-i. IT does not give as much power as the vvti or the vtec. So why but mitsubitshi? Never judge a book by its cover. City vtec, vios vvt-i and lancer mivec...... city has the fastest acceleration. vios is behind city by less then a second due to its light built body less then a ton...... lancer is not lighter then the vios... nor does it has the power of the vTEC engine.. so why get lancer? again it is for looks.......... but anyway lancer great car to show off its exterior... but for speed..... hm..... u better give a tought abt it... AND DUn CHEAT HOR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WHAT I TALK IS STOCK CAR ONLY&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NO WHAT ECU UPGRADE ADD IN TURBO, SUPERCHARGE AND STUFF HOR......</div>
