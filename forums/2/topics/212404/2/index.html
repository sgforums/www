I'm so impressed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>How you clocked over 250,000 km behind the wheel?  Have you driven in different seasons?  Have you driven left-hand drive?  Have you ever had to double clutch?  Dealt with a punctured tyre on a curve at 140 km/h?  Suffered a wheel-bearing collapse at 100?  Encountered a Somali cab driver?<br><br>If you can tick off half of the above list, maybe, just maybe, you can try telling me you're a seasoned driver.<br><br>Let's take your scenario.  You see red lights. You are at 4th gear. You clutch in. Brake gradually. Some dickhead going the opposite way decides he wants to run through and stomps on it.  He loses the car and drifts into your lane, heading right for you and you need to move forward right quick to get out of his way.  You let the clutch back in but you're in third at 15 km/h and the car's sluggish because you really should have been in second, but you were just too complacent.<br><br>Next thing you know, you're sitting in a broken car with your dick in your hands.  Congratulations.<br><br>Yeah, you're a real seasoned driver.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It may be the case with certain carburetted engines because the venturi effect is increased at higher revs, but most of the new engine management systems will sense when you're engine braking and cut fuel flow until you're below about 1500 rpm.  If you're rolling downhill in gear with your foot off the pedal, you're in fact saving fuel.</div>

By definition, engine braking is creating resistance from the engine by means of a reduced air-fuel mixture, i.e. the intake stroke takes more energy than the power stroke produces.  Because the throttle is closed, it would not draw any more fuel than if the engine was idling.  The only thing that might explain it is wonky fuel metering.<br><br></div>
