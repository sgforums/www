              <p>Dear one and all </p>
              <p>I'm appealing for help and witnesses who might have seen a collision that occured along New Bridge Road today.</p>
              <p>It was at 18:45, on 10 Aug 2012 when I was in the second lane (going both straight and turning right), ready to proceed straight when the light was green. Suddenly from the third lane (going only straight) a white car cut into my lane and collided into my front left headlamp and bumper. I never knew he was going to cut in and only saw his presence when the bang occured. We both turned right and stopped along the double yellow line. My mother was in the front passenger seat at that time and we are thankfully both unhurt. </p>
              <p>However, unfortunately I only managed to jot down his NRIC and I entirely forgot to take any photos of his car or note his car plate. At first I thought it is a white honda but I can't be sure now. I am very certain he is at fault although he was adamant that he signalled right and I should have seen.  BUT, I was in the second lane with the right of way and it was not right for him to turn right at the last minute from the third lane that isn't even allowed the right turn. </p>
              <p>I understand that if we were to be at a straight road with still space I could see him and give way, but we were both pass the white line into the cross junction when he swerved into my lane and hit my front bumper. This resulted in only scratch lines on his right side but a huge dent on my front bumper.</p>
              <p>There was an obvious traffic camera infront of us but it won't be possible for the authories to release anything cause they were no casualties. I'm aware of the 50-50 chance of liability but in terms of traffic offences, I reckon he is wrong.</p>
              <p>Could you the kind community give any advice in this case? In some ways it seems like I've the advantage, yet I don't. I'm feeling really sucky about not getting the car plate too. Witnesses who might have seen the car plate or accident, please step out and contact me! </p>
