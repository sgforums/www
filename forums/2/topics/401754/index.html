              <p>U are the one who beat the red light and seems to want to pass the bucket to the cab driver...I am not a fan of the cab driving but its not his fault that U were in the middle of the junction isnt it?</p>

              <p>I can picture the accident, because my sis got into the same accident, misjudgement of the incoming traffic at the junction, made the turn, not in time, and incoming traffic whack the car head on. Thankfully no one was badly hurt. However 2 cars were totalled, and another 3 more had some damage.</p>
              <p>It happened last year right after the CNY, I tell you insurance settled everything but the claims are still coming, the charges are ridiculous but at least the insurance firm is smart enough to ignore them.</p>
              <p>The police will do all the necessary investigations, they will tell you this and that, its just protocol nothing to worry. They won't pinpoint one's blame or another. Just paperwork, and let the insurance settle it.</p>

              <p>The car was my dad's but the insurance covered all drivers in our family including me. Yes, no more discounts on insurance is one thing. Including this incident, my dad chalked up another 2 more claims under the same insurance company, 1 of them not being his fault, cabbie driver whack his backside of his new car after the above one got written off.</p>
              <p>His premium now machiam same as any young driver, coz the company not happy he claim 3 times in under 8 months. So his new car although COE record low, his insurance is record high.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>My sister probably fared worse, when that accident occured, she was still a probationary plate driver, left few months to go. Now she think twice about driving out late at night.</p>

              <p>Wah privately. Did you both sign any undertaking right after the
              accident or not? Wait all sorts of funny funny claims come up. Even
              for my dad case, the other not so damaged cars are still pursuing
              ridiculous claims like health and such, which the insurance company
              has dismissed repeatedly. Some workshops spoil the market by
              telling the victims all sorts of stories, can claim this and that,
              because the workshop gets a share, including the lawyer and all
              that crap.</p>

              <p>some drive on a normal day, and then poom! they get into an accident and worse, they lose their limbs. Some drive into the drain or hit the tree because they dozed off, having to scrap the entire car. Some drive till their cars turn turtle....so it's no big deal.</p>
              <p>An accident that u have come out of alive simply means you have the chance to drive carefully in future.</p>
