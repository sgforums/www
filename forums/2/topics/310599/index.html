              <p>A lorry rammed into another in front of it, swiping the second lorry
              off its lane and then went on to plough into a car, crushing the driver
              inside to death.</p>
              <p>The horrendous accident, which also caused another car and an SBS
              bus to be hit, happened along Loyang Avenue towards Tampines Road at
              about 3.30 this afternoon.</p>
              <p>Eyewitnesses said the driver of the maroon Toyota car was slowing to a stop at a traffic light junction.</p>
              <p>The accident left the vehicle in a twisted ball of metal.</p>
              <p>The driver died on the spot.</p>
              <p>straitstimes.com was at the scene of the accident.</p>

              <p>"why never catch?"</p>
              <p>uhh.. see your last line..</p>
              <p>if a couple of TP was around, they'd not speed.. if TP not there, they speed..</p>
              <p>like that how to catch??</p>
              <p>btw.. everything also blame gabrament?</p>
              <p>i know they are not the best, and a lot of them are asswipes.. but do not mistake the civil service for the gabrament.. they are different things.. and also, think about it.. they may be doing a lot of things which you do not know about and everything gets mangled because some asswipes whose names i keep seeing in the newspapers keep writing to the ST Forum and other newspapers about..</p>
              <p>i was talking to a few people in the forces.. a few of their investigations went to shit because asswipes write into the newspapers, trying to "advise" the investigators what to do... the investigations were trying to get to the bigwigs.. in the end, after the splashing in the ST Forum and whatnot, the criminal bigwigs decided to burrow deeper, change their MO or just disappear altogether..</p>
              <p>as for speeding, it's a matter of personal responsibility right?</p>
              <p>or do you want the gabrament to enforce that too.. so that you can accuse them of being fascist? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p><br>I didn't say anything political, I was quoting the reader's response. Just click on the link in tamago's first post,</p>
              <p>the reader made those comments which I posted in red.</p>
              <p>The reader was just commenting that when something like this happens, then the police will step up enforcement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did I blame the government for what happened?</p>
              <p>Can you please point out which part of my statement in black did I mention anything about the government?</p>
              <p>The Singapore Police Force is the government now?</p>
              <p>I know you have been indoctrinated by our propagandist education system to side P4P,</p>
              <p>so the slightest slightest issue to suggest government involvement and your defence system will be activated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of my post I was talking about the speed of heavy vehicles.</p>
              <p>You are quite the presumptuous prick aren't you?</p>
              <p>I suppose my post in <a href="/forums/1769/topics/310450">"this brought tears to my eyes"</a> is also political?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you feel that my post in the speaker's corner has been incorrect,</p>
              <p>you can debate me there, instead of keeping your views and anger bottled up,</p>
              <p>then throwing an unexpected curve ball at me here.</p>
