( i know horizon hill is nearer to 2nd link )<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>Taman Sutera is closer to Perling interchange, which will remain congested until the current upgrade has completed.  Taman Sutera Utama is close to the north-bound lanes of Jalan Skudai, which does not really make it close to the causeway, as the TUTA interchange where a U-turn can be made is susceptible to congestion during peak hours.  Horizon Hills is about ten to twenty minutes further away from the causeway compared to Taman Sutera and Taman Sutera Utama.  There is a plan to build a road linking Jalan Skudai and Nusajaya, making Horizon Hills significantly closer to the causeway, but just like any plan proposed by the Malaysian government, it can take a decade to materialize, if it ever materializes at all.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br><br>from what u have mentioned, it seems quite inside bukit indah.. u sure it is safe?<br><br></strong><br></blockquote>I am one of the "minority" who have never been robbed successfully in Johor Baru.
