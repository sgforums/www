To them, as long as you can afford to go to JB to shop or eat, you are fair game.<br><br>What can you buy or eat with just small change? Curry puff, sweets, teh-o?? If that is the case, better dun go there, you can buy them stuff in SG.<br><br>Anyway, they won't believe you come to JB with just small change. They probably  thought you may have big change stuffed somewhere in you. So they corner you, whip out knives, beat you up and force you to produce your big change. Let's say you really brought along small change just to buy sweets, teh-o and curry puff at JB, these guys will still have beaten you up. Furthermore, they will get incensed when they discovered that you are a real cheapo.....they will probably stick a knife into you for being a cheapo and wasting their valuable time in picking out the wrong target!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

ALL cars are eligible, singapore or msians. And in all cases, they usually involve having a girl in the car.<br><br>(Like the couple one they saw bf and gf in car, bang and took necessary actions to rob and rape)<br><br>and the other point is that all the "identified" victims are chinese (fact of the case) and the "identified" assailants have all been malay so far (fact of the case). the msian government has urged the public not to turn this into a racial matter even though those are the facts. if u have seen any other articles that identiy the victims or assailants as otherwise pls let me noe so i can edit this paragraph cos i might have missed some articles..<br><br>but facts are facts, so if you're chi u will be more likely a target i guess?<br><br>so ya nobody's gonna noe how much u really have and they dont really care either. it's a whack first, check later.<br><br>for girls its worse, cos once u look "edible", they will bite.</div>

It, and the new Horizon Hills, may be two of the best places to live in.  I have not heard of any serious crime in the residential area of the former yet, while the latter is still under construction, but the recent track record of the developer indicates it can probably match the former.<br></div></blockquote>Horizon hills is really good.

Of course, I seldom traveled at 22:30.  I still have problem figuring out where exactly she was robbed, since there isn't any dead-end along the way she took as reported in newspapers.<br><br>I was at the Horizon Hills work site during its launch.  Might buy a 2.5 story unit facing the golf course, but only if I have half a million Sing dollars.............  Living in a 22x70 "zoo" with grilles everywhere isn't fun, just that it might not be possible to get an equivalent "zoo" in Singapore even with a million Sing dollars.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi maybe u can tell me more about Horizon hills? When u talk about half a million Singapore dollars for a 22x70 house in Johor, its quite impossible leh.<br><br>Is it 24-hour gated and guarded by Taman Sutera Utama? If the concept is the same, I think Horizon Hill could take off, being in a location near to 2nd link. Sutera is a bit further in although Sutera is quite near to both 2nd link and JB custom and supported by Temasek Holdings.<br><br>When u talk about using gelang patah roads to bukit indah, do u use bikes or car? Sometimes i drive in using 2nd link at 8pm plus.. total darkness but at least there  are still people working in Singapore returning home to skudai, bukit indah etc.<br><br>there are indeed quite a few dead ends along gelang patah that side.. some of them just run below the highway... during daytime, try to observe to your left and see if there are any roads running below.<br><br>Its a pity that the couple was robbed and injured really. But I must agree that sometimes when driving to Singapore at Gelang patah side around 8pm plus, some stretch of the road I am alone and total darkness for around 1 minute. Quite dangerous I must say.<br><br>Hope to share more with u dude because you seem quite enriched about the lifestyle there like me and a few good friends in forums.<br><br>p/s: dont buy horizon hill. if got spare cash, buy a lot at sutera utama. by next year this time u will know why.<br><br>cheers.<br></div>

You will pass a Bukit Indah 2 security booth.  Continue to go straight.  You will see the big Horizon Hills sign.  It should be about three minutes of drive from the highway.  In the satellite image below, it is the empty space at the bottom.  You can see several show houses in the image.<br><br><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=bukit+indah+johor+google+earth&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=89.842582,112.851563&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=k&amp;om=1&amp;ll=1.470848,103.653173&amp;spn=0.029302,0.027552&amp;z=15" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=bukit+indah+johor+google+earth&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=89.842582,112.851563&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=k&amp;om=1&amp;ll=1.470848,103.653173&amp;spn=0.029302,0.027552&amp;z=15</a></div>
