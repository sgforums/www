            <div class='col-md body'>I hate both groups lah.<br><br>But I dun think HOGGERS cause more accidents than SPEEDSTERS. They are travelling at a certain speed and you are just following behind them. THey did not cause accidents what. They are just irritating the hell out of you. Accidents happen only when you become so irritated and try to overtake them without proper checking and kena banged....nothing would have happen if you stay behind them at a reasonable distance. SO, HOGGERS dun cause accidents, they just are irritants.<br><br>SPEEDSTERS are the ones who bring the accidents upon themselves. Some cars travel at such a speed that it is almost impossible for them to do anything if they hit an oil patch or some big objects on the road and goes into a spin. If you watched those videos that they showed when u go for defensive driving courses, you would see many accidents on the road caused by speeding.<br><br>So, in the end, both groups are irritating. But dun blame others for accidents. THere is always something you can do and that is to be patient.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes even high beam those hoggers, they still bo chap.<br>Hrmm... This reminds me on the topic of keep left unless over taking.<br>Normally those who travel on lane 1, thinks that as long as they travel within the speed limit like 90km/h on the expressway mean they are on the right of way. But what about keep left unless over taking. Some people who drive faster can't over take on the right into the bushes or dividers when on lane 1 right?<br>Hoggers cause the most accident. They themselves dun take notice as it does not involve them but it happen around them.  Accidents happen when changing lanes to overtake, or sudden braking due to a hogger in front.<br><br>Its a norm to see cars going @ 110 on lane 1. hoggers should be the one to give way and not the other way round.  I tink LTA should emphasize more on the Keep Left Unless Overtaking rule.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why some hoggers do not change to a slower lane is because they're not confident or competent enough to change right there and then, especially when traffic is heavy. Plus usually it's the case that on lane 2 all the cars are zooming by overtaking him.  So how to cut in ? LOL</div>
