              <p>My BF &amp; I were driving on the way down from IMM Multi-Storey round-about carpark..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just when we were on our way down to the 1st floor, a taxi suddenly dashed out on our left. Hence, my BF have to jam brake immediately to avoid collision with the taxi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT..who knows (really damn sway) that the car behind us tailgate until so closely that he banged into the back of our car!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The impact was great enough to cause a small chunk of the car plate to drop off + scratches on the bumper</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's infuriating was that this driver still pointed at my BF &amp; asked him "do you know how to drive or not? how long have you been driving liao?!" whereby he's only 22 loh! Try to act bengish in front of us =.='''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He even insist that he isn't in the wrong as it was my BF's fault to jam brake suddenly (even though we explained to him with regards to the taxi driver).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He even insist that he maintained a safe distance b/w us + he's driving at a super slow speed (which is bullshit). Cuz if what he says is true, the impact on our car won't be so great that results a small chunk of the car plate to fall off..If he's not tail gating, our car will only kena a few scratches when he banged into us..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That xiao ah beng still dare to widen his arms &amp; retort back saying that : "Are you trying to tell me that I should maintain such a long distance away from your car? like 10m??" (while showing that XL face of his)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, that guy refused to pay up for the damage &amp; ranted that it isn't his fault..He just told us that he will leave this matter to the insurance agents "to fight it out" &amp; he drove off =.=''' (But, we already took down the necessary info. before we let him go)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We know that most likely we can claim insurance from that xiao ah beng (which our insurance agent confirmed so). But, is just a matter of waste of time &amp; effort to settle this issue + that stupid attitude of Xiao ah beng =.='''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, I regretted not taking down his photo..If not, I can post it here &amp; show everyone how ah bengs argued during car accidents *pouts* Show tattoo, XL face, impatient tone..*shakes head*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S : heard from my friends that normally we can get compensated in most of the cases, if we are being banged from behind..is that true? o.O</p>

              tot the xiao ah beng should noe abt the 2sec rule from basic theory (or izzit final theory i forgot) since at most he got his license for 4 yrs only.
              
              2 sec rule is to prevent tailgating.
              if travelling at slow speed, the 2 sec rule will mean that the distance between the 2 vehicles is shorter than when travelling at high speed.
              
              TS 1 - 0 xiao ah beng
              
              ur case should be 100% win provided that u took pics at the accident scene.
              cos no matter wat the xiao ah beng can say, it's a fact that he didnt maintain a safe distance.
              oh yah... wat's the actual damage to ur car?
              
              it's time to do a makeover to ur bf's car!
              change the whole rear bumper, respray the whole car cos the paint on the bumper wont match the paint on the rest of the car 100%.
              change new reverse sensor etc.
              
              congrats! ur bf juz got a windfall!

              <p>BUT..who knows (really damn sway) that the car behind us
              tailgate until so closely that he banged into the back of our
              car!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The impact was great enough to cause a small chunk of the car

              <p> </p>
              <p>What's infuriating was that this driver still pointed at my BF
              &amp; asked him "do you know how to drive or not? how long have you
              been driving liao?!" whereby he's only 22 loh! Try to act bengish
              in front of us =.='''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He even insist that he isn't in the wrong as it was my BF's
              fault to jam brake suddenly (even though we explained to him with
              regards to the taxi driver).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He even insist that he maintained a safe distance b/w us + he's
              driving at a super slow speed (which is bullshit). Cuz if what he
              says is true, the impact on our car won't be so great that results
              a small chunk of the car plate to fall off..If he's not tail
              gating, our car will only kena a few scratches when he banged into
              us..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That xiao ah beng still dare to widen his arms &amp; retort back
              saying that : "Are you trying to tell me that I should maintain
              such a long distance away from your car? like 10m??" (while showing
              that XL face of his)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, that guy refused to pay up for the damage &amp; ranted
              that it isn't his fault..He just told us that he will leave this
              matter to the insurance agents "to fight it out" &amp; he drove off
              =.=''' (But, we already took down the necessary info. before we let
              him go)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We know that most likely we can claim insurance from that xiao
              ah beng (which our insurance agent confirmed so). But, is just a
              matter of waste of time &amp; effort to settle this issue + that
              stupid attitude of Xiao ah beng =.='''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, I regretted not taking down his photo..If not, I can
              post it here &amp; show everyone how ah bengs argued during
              car accidents *pouts* Show tattoo, XL face, impatient tone..*shakes
              head*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S : heard from my friends that normally we can get compensated
              in most of the cases, if we are being banged from behind..is that

              <p><br>Its funny because i was reading an article on past dictators and evil rulers; that these people actually project a sense of aggressiveness to compensate for their lack of security and inferiority.</p>
              <p>I guess that's what the ah-beng was trying to project on TS. Usually these pricks (ahbengs and mats) are scared of people bigger size than them so they naturally avoid me like the plague.</p>
              <p>If they're in a group you can see the false sense of security radiating from them.</p>
