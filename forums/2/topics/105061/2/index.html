THAT is the crux of the matter. What this thread is meant to point out is that, all roadusers, be they drivers or bikers, HAVE to make sure that u have proper clearance b4 attempting to switch lanes, or else, a nasty accident might occur. I hope no one is going to try to label this a driver vs rider thread again. please read properly.</div>
