            <div class='col-md body'>You guys heard about riders that zip between lanes? Dangerous ain't it?  Well I'll relate an incident I experienced this afternoon as I was riding to work...<br><br>I was riding on the centre lane of a main road towards AMK. I took the middle of the lane, like a bike should. When this car on my right decided to change lanes.<br><br>He switched on his signal and moved to the left, nothing wrong right? Well except that I was exactly on his left. Apparently from the vehicle's movement I kinda sensed his was trying to push me out of my lane.<br><br>I looked to my right and it was an bespectacled uncle.  His car was still hovering right next to me, still trying to nudge me out of my lane. I opened my throttle and moved faster... if he wants to change lanes, change behind me.  Suddenly my bike wobbled... something hit my rear tyre. I got back my control by adjusting my handlebar. Immediately I checked my mirror and I see the car swerving back into the right lane.<br><br>I turned back and he raise his hand to apologise. First thing that came to my mind was "F*cking idiot, if there's an accident let's see if you have the chance to even apologise", he changed lanes and exited towards CTE (PIE), while i headed to CTE (SLE).<br><br>This incident might happen to one in the many drivers. But one is enough to cause an accident, one accident is too many. So please don't do stupid things like trying to squeeze bikes to the side or overtaking so near them.<br><br>I've always said, the bikers who squeeze between traffic, there's no reason to block them. If they get into an accident its their own fault, they chose to squeeze and lose control, its their own bad decision. Don't do things to increase the percentage of an accident.<br><br>For my incident, I was taking the centre of the lane like a car. And this driver chose to come in with me still there. I don't know what else to say. Let's take this incident and learn from it.<br><br>Personally I don't care if I get injured as long as my bike isn't too damaged. But other people's lives are important. So please drive carefully.</div>

If I get into any accident, regardless of whose fault, I dun feel good also.

I always tell my father cos he riding bike and I drive car... I say, why ride like those bikes I see on the highway? zipping in and out and in the middle 2 cars...I say if any of the cars decide to just move a bit, you are gone, who got more to lose? You or the car? If no injury nevermind, if you die, who lose more?<br><br>So I guess sometimes, I see cars or motor want to die die overtake me or cut into my lane, I just let go lah.... after my accident... I have become more patient lah...<br><br>So in this case you can say I car driver I biase but I guess when you see him wanna cut into your lane, defensive riding and driving would tell you to slow down and let him cut lor, rite?

I'm a driver too, not all riders just know how to ride a bike.</div>
