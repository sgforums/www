            <div class='col-md body'>Bro you'll get more seasoned with more mileage. In the meantime just stay more conservative.<br><br>Just a few things I think may be helpful:<br><br>1. Pick Up Speed: If you want to get onto the overtaking lane, be sure you're fast enough not to road hog. If you're driving manual, downshift to a suitable gear such that you can get more engine response. If it's auto, then floor the gas pedal more to induce the transmission to downshift, or use your manual override. Get the rpm spooled up even before you change lane, because if you only do so after you change lane, your real speed increase after the lag is enough to frustrate faster cars coming from behind.<br><br>2. Keep sufficient distance from the car you're overtaking: Because you need to start increasing your speed early as mentioned above, you need some space in front to play around with before switching lanes. And, while you're busy checking the lane you're changing to, your attention on the car in front will be less.<br><br>3. Gauge well: Perhaps I found this the hardest. I'm not talking about simply checking for the presence, such that when there's car on the right at the back, we die die cannot overtake. It's not always the case. I'm referring to gauging the speed of this car relative to yours. This can't be taught. After some experience, you should be able to gain more confidence in slotting into these gaps without causing tension to others.<br><br>4. Signal: Always let your intentions be known. Some may say 'don't signal', as it encourages others not to let you in. But I say, when I increase my speed to 'not let you in', it's not because I'm not courteous, but because I want it to be clear-cut that you shouldn't come in. Short &amp; sweet &amp; safe. Instead of you getting caught in both minds and making the wrong move. I may also lightly tap my horn or flash my high beam, not to provoke you, but to deter you. Hence don't get too sensitive like some self-centred Singaporeans and misinterpret others' meanings when you encounter such acts.<br></div>
