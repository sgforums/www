All my friends around me are hitched and many have planned or already married. In my group of friends, once hitched then you never see him again. So I have to keep looking for new friends. All old friends gone, so sometimes might feel a little desperate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by choppers:</div><div class="quote_body">hmmm after reading this topic.. it spurred meeven further to stop driving... with driving i saved abt $500.. if i dun, i save abt $1500.....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Depends on your pirority. I still haven't have enough fun with my car. Like my friend, they can save up 12k in a year just to use it in a trip up some mountains. Only 3 weeks time. Key is to have fun when young, cause even if you have money when old, you are still limited by your own age.</div>
