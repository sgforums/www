For most (luckily), the prirority isn't a car, so don't have to buy it. Looking at it at a more simple way, they are some who pub, and they are those who think otherwise. It isn't cheap to pub too.</div>

Plus the car is still presentable.<br><br>Or if you are seriously talking about 600 for installment, you can actually afford a Vios for a 10 years full loan. Of course it is not adviseable to loan for so long, but you sounded like you have no savings to downpaid. And 600/month for installation will allow you a 55k car for 10 years loan. Best if you have 15k to down, then you can support for with a 7 year loan.</div>

If you can downpaid a huge sum so as not to suffer from it super high interest.<br>2. If you have not intention to drive it for more 5 years.<br><br>If you get loans that extends all the way to the death date of the COE, the car will always be a liability to you. Even if you want to sell it off 2-3 years before the end of its COE, you might still have to top-up for the loan you own the bank.</div>

As long as you loan full amount for a period as long as the car's COE's life, that break-even point would be very close to the end of the COE.<br><br>So do you foresee yourself with that car for long?</div>

But really need to know how much a month you are willing to set aside for the car. In terms of cheap, Kelisa and Picanto both have their share of the market with low operating cost. Next better choice would be Vios already for its FC. Installation would be about 500 per month.</div>
