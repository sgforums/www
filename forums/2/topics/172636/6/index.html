I have worked hard enough though I would say my parents are genuinely well to do and we live in District 9 in a private condo.<br>When I asked my dad for a car when I started work, he told me, sure buy it, with your own money.  Now that he has passed on, that was a great lesson learnt.  I bought my 1st car in 1995 when I started working real hard and had my 1st gold card after 1 year.  Now Platinum is easy meat.</div>

A bit of luck never made anyone less satisfied. But at the end of the day, be your satisfaction due to the hard work of others or yourself, one shouldn't lose focus of one's humility.</div>
