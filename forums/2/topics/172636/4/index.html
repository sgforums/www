I'm thoroughly ashamed of those who boast about their new car (bought by their parents).<br><br>Also, these rich spoilt brats love to win friends over this way. Sad to say, it works because many are susceptible to material stuffs. I'd love to see their arrogant faces fall when a financial situation befalls on the family and the car has to be sold.
