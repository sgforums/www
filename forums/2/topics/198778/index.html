            <div class='col-md body'>BM have the biggest market share and their margin is low.<br>They can better cover the profit and losses(lesser profit) with atleast 2000 units sold every mth. The thing now is alot of small dealer and PI can't compete with them in term of cash flow as many of their cars still stuck in the port and some of them are 2005 stocks. The holding cost in the port cost them alot as it force them to cut their COE bidding power. The market is over supply as for now with the nos. of COE is still alot compared to the nos. of bidders in ratio.<br><br>BM profit is about 5-7k depend on the COE price and Mazda can be 10-15k margin. that's why COE can only move between +/- 3k with BM account for 2-3k nos of cars compared to MM of 400 monthly. And I heard from friends in the past Nissan alway asked customer to top up COE, now customer are not willing to do that. So can see from their sales is going down as much as half.<br>Honda are doing well cos of new model, but their margin is too high. Only ppl like Honda will buy if not they will switch to other brand due to the high running cost. Can see from the chart BM is still the market leader, the sale nos is 3x more than 4 placing Hyundai.
