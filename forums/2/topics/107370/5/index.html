            <div class='col-md body'>seriously, i m damn curious about the monday thingy too.... but actually i passed on a monday too... but the reason i chosen monday that time was b'cos i needed the rest on sunday to prepare for the test... work was tiring...<br><br>anyway, TP is really all about pure luck... not only weather (as mentioned in the earlier post), it also depend on the route, other traffic users and the car itself.... Imagine a road full of taxis.... one obstruction after another thanks to them... really will test your reaction up to the max... And if u r from School, the cars will all be different... my fren kana one with a "dying" clutch... in the end he kept stalling and of cos got more kan cheong....<br><br>so to the original poster, good luck and all e best eh..!! never give up..!! The time u had selected for your next test (10.15am) is actually one of the best times eh, from wat my instructor advices me tat time... cos at this time it's already after morning peak hour and still before lunch time... so the road will be quite empty, &amp; easier to drive..!!<br><br>Btw where's ur test? cdc or ssdc or bbdc?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was devastated when i failed my TP for the first time <img src="http://www.instagiber.net/smiliesdotcom/kao/otn/blobdaze.gif">... Took me a long time to get over it.. After that i break for 1 month due to exams and I took 4 revision lessons for the second try...<br><br>During the second attempt, while waiting in the sha zhu chang, I met this auntie who i saw during my first Tp, turned out that she also student from kovan CDC... It was her 3rd attempt and we chatted with each other to calm our nervEs... The tester face is really charcoal black and when I walked towards my car, he actually didnt follow me cos i walking under the sun and he walked under the shade.. <img src="http://www.instagiber.net/smiliesdotcom/kao/otn/blobtongue.gif"><br><br>During the slope part my car actually rolled back 3 times and died 3 times, i really want to cry and break down at that point becos i never had problem handling slope. luckily the private car beside me on the right waited for me and didn't make me more kan cheong... i told myself to relax and try one last time, this time it finally went over... the thought of it still scares me now, i dunno how i managed to overcome that but i did~  i was actually breathing deeply and chanting "relax girl, relax... u can do it"... the tester must be thinking i am xiao or what...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>i felt quite disappointed after that but the tester kept quiet and didn't tick anything so i just continued... i thought sure gone case, fail again so i not nervous anymore and can drive normally.. hahaha...<br><br>when i went up to the room with him, he still never say anything just tick tick tick, minus 10 points (6 for the slope and 4 for wide turning) and handed the paper to me, still no comments... i was so happie~ <img src="http://www.instagiber.net/smiliesdotcom/kao/otn/pconfetti.gif"><br><br>actually wearing sexy, i dun think it helps much... the first time i wore spag top, i striked kerb twice also fail.. second time i wore my liverpool jersey, nothing much to show then can pass... first time i pray at si ma lu also didnt work~ my instructor say take at end of month easier to pass so first attempt i booked 29th then second time i took my test on the 8th ... but i agree that luck is an important factor...<br><br>Good luck to those who are taking their TP <img src="http://www.instagiber.net/smiliesdotcom/kao/otn/pfairy.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know that despite being "advised" so many time by so many people from all walks of life on needing to be confident, calm, etc etc, the test day is test day, you can't help it but feel (and perhaps do)exactly the opposite of what people have said, you can't seems to calm down, tend to make mistake not made in the past, etc because you know that time is a major change for you, a time when you will move on to a new paradigm of life...able to enjoy the pleasure (or pressure) of driving on roads without the stupid L Plate in front of the car, without the instructor beside you, without keeping to the confinement of the test area, if you make it, that is.<br><br>Since advice is useless, I can offer suggestions, maybe if you are under private, maybe can ask you instructor to mock up a scenario exactly / closest to the test, treat the mock test if you are really taking the test, go through the circuit, go through one of a pre-selected route and see how many points your instructor give you. Go through as many time as possible. The important thing is that you have to treat each time like the real test.<br><br>I know the feeling is that when you instructor(whom has become more of your friend, teacher, someone you are familiar with) is beside you, you will relax and able to perform but change a person, the sense of security is gone! So my suggestion is that maybe you get your instructor to arrange to can get another instructor (whom might be your instructor's friend) to sit beside you for a change. Again treat it like the real test with the real tester.<br><br>You might wish to consider...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

People keep blaming on luck when the TP test is all about the ability to handle the car. If you are up to it, no matter what situation comes, you <strong>must</strong> be able to handle it. Imagine if you passed and get to drive on the public road yourself, are you gonna blame it on luck when u crash into other vehicles? Or worse still knock down people?! It's other people's lives at stake!!<br><br>I've seen too many horrible drivers on the road, so much that I wonder how they passed in the first place. These people are not only road hazards, but are a danger to other people's lives. That is why I encourage those who know it themselves that they are not confident and not able to handle a car, pls dont even bother to pass the TP test and become a danger on the road. sori if i sound discouraging, but it's for your own good too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
