Statistics from the TP website show that CDC has the highest passing rate. SSDC is second. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Anyway, passing TP really depends on many factors. I'd say it's 50% driving skills, 50% other things like tester, weather and road conditions, pedestrians, other vehicles, etc.<br><br>No doubt about it, some testers are stricter than others, so it depends on who you get. But all of them look out for two things: (1) pedestrians and (2) blind spots. Safety is #1, so present yourself as a safe and confident driver, and you will pass. Don't freak out, or they will fail you thinking that you will similarly freak out when you drive next time! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Chill <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div></blockquote>Hmmm... wonder if testers tend to be more lenient and pass those who've taken many times, closing one eye... if so it'll indeed lead to lots of incompetent drivers on the road.<br><br>But again, many pple who pass the first or second time also cannot make it as drivers one, crash their cars while still on P-plate... maybe a better idea would be to require new drivers (p-platers) to have a qualified driver beside them when driving, to help guide them and respond to emergencies... and maybe require new drivers to have a minimum no. of accident-free driving hours before they are allowed to take out their p-plate and drive alone. Cos with the current system, i know of many pple who simply avoid driving at all in their first year and just imagine, when they start driving again after a 1 year break, what a road hazard they potentially pose to other road users...<br><br>Cos really, passing the driving test is only the first step to becoming a safe and competent motorist.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
