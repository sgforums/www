            <div class='col-md body'>There are alot of ppl only think of today, what happen tomolo doesn't bother them. If they think they can affort the small down payment and monthly instalment, they just go ahead signing on the dotted line. If one really calculate the overall cost it will be about 10k per year to drive a normal 1.6L car. And if they take high loan then that is another problem. So ppl just dun do calculation and consider all the factor before owning one. And simply giving stupid comment is just what common Singaporean do, just show that how stupid and jealous they are and no need to take it seriouly.</div>
