            <div class='col-md body'>I am replying with personal knowledge and if other ppl thinks i am wrong correct me by all means...<br><br>To get license, the fastest time frame is 3 months. It will cost about $1200.<br>I did not get mine locally, so this is as much as i know from my friends.<br><br>You can buy your car even before you get the license. But their will be alot of insurance issues after you get your license. You will need to change the police schedule, etc. So i suggest get the car after the license.<br><br>However, being new licensed driver, be prepared to pay hefty insurance of at least $1800. Depending on type/make of car.<br><br>To buy a car you must be able to afford the downpayment. Latest changes have made quite a big mess but i heard you can pay as low as 15% of the value of the car. The rest payable by loan.<br><br>To sustain a car comfortably, you may need a monthly income of $2500-3000. But you have to make some personal sacrifices.<br><br>Montly expenses, $200-400 on fuel (depending how you drive)<br>Monthly debt payment $500-3000 (depending on car and loan term)<br><br>COE is just a government's way of curbing car population. You have to get one thur bidding. Succesful bidders will get to buy cars. Bidding process, don't worry salesman will do that for you.<br><br>AS for "litres" it is just the engine capacity. The volume of the combustion chamber (cylinder) of the car. In general, the bigger the volume, the more powerful the car but the more fuel uneconomical.<br><br>Recent technologies have made these volumes very hard to gauge.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by projectlime:</div><div class="quote_body">hey people..<br>ive done searchin but i found no threads really regardin the ans i wanted...<br>I'm a guy ready work really hard towards my dream in getting a car and licencse. but ill really dont know nuts about cars and LTA rules and regulations and all the stuffs. i hope you guys here can help me. thanks man!<br><br>firstly, where do i sign up to take my license? and is it after a test den ill be able to get a license? theory test  and 'physically driving a car'?<br><br>normally, how long does it takes to get a license?<br><br>if i have the money, can i get a car straight away after i got my license?<br><br>how much do i roughly need to buy a decent car? how much savings to maintain it?<br><br>what the hell is COE? and how much do i've to pay for the COE and than for the car?

Once you pass your Basic Theory Test you can start your practical lessons with a Provisional Driving License.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">normally, how long does it takes to get a license?</span><br><br>Depending on your performance and the time you have, it can range between 3 months to a year.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if i have the money, can i get a car straight away after i got my license?</span><br><br>If you have money you can get a car anytime. Haha!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">how much do i roughly need to buy a decent car? how much savings to maintain it?</span><br><br>About 50-60k. Maintanence varies from car to car.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">what the hell is COE? and how much do i've to pay for the COE and than for the car? (i heard from time to time, COE are more expensive den a car? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> )</span><br><br>Certificate of Entitlement. No, COE are not more expensive than a car, if that is the case toyotas would cost 100k. These are measures by the govt to increase the price of buying a car so as to discourage singaporeans from buying a car.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">what does the difference in litre means? i read some cars are 1.5l some 2l? able to go futher with more petrol?</span><br><br>Engine capacity. Higher engine capacity means more power, and generally cars with higher engine capacity will be bigger, more spacious. FC varies from car to car.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hmm... is car really only for those with ample and stable $$ in their bank??</span><br><br>That is generally true. Cars in singapore is a luxury, not a neccesity. Unless you are rich, it is not practical to own a car unless you need it for purposes such as work. Owning a car is a big financial burden, so be sure you have the means to undertake it first.<br><br>any more beginners tips will be appreciated. thanks again.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> </blockquote></div>
