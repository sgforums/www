            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Five cars have been vandalised with spray paint at a multi-storey carpark in Punggol North.<br><br>The 32-year old owner of one car, who only wants to be known as Ms Tham, said she had parked the 6-month-old car on Sunday night and was shocked when she next saw it.<br><br>The spray-paint cans used in the crime were found in a trash bag.<br><br>Ms Tham said, "We've been staying here for two years and we chose to stay in Punggol because it's a very quiet and peaceful town. And for something like this to happen is very unexpected. And it really makes me question how safe it is to park your car in a HDB car park and especially in Punggol."<br><br>Four other vehicles, which were not at the carpark when Channel NewsAsia visited, had also been vandalised.<br><br>Ms Tham said, "Some car owners have told me that they'll try to park somewhere else, even if it's more inconvenient. But another carpark could be hit as well.<br><br>"My biggest concern is not the cost that I have to fork out to re-spray the car but whether something like this might happen again because five cars is not a small matter."<br><br>The owner of another car, parked just three vehicles away from the vandalised one, is also concerned now.<br><br>Winston Tay told Channel NewsAsia, "Of course it's quite scary after what you told me that five cars have already been vandalised. In the night, it's quite quiet, but majority of the cars come back (at) about 9. Maybe they can install some CCTV somewhere...and then hopefully they can catch the culprit."<br><br>Member-of-Parliament for the area, Penny Low, who came to find out more about the incident, said she will get the "Citizens on Patrol" to step up its efforts.<br><br>She said, "I've spoken with one of the victims and she has even decided to step forward to join the Citizens on Patrol to serve as the constant eyes and ears on the ground to help us to beat crime. Once in a while, we do get such cases but it's not rampant."<br><br>The five-level carpark services about two blocks of flats around the area.<br><br>One Honda Jazz was randomly targeted on the second level.<br><br>Some others were also vandalised on the first floor.<br><br>This incident, involving five vandalised cars, is the most serious for Punggol North this year.<br><br>Anyone found vandalising can face a fine, or a jail term of up to two years or both. - CNA/ms</div>
