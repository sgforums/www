            <div class='col-md body'>Why does everyone has the wrong idea that car sales man earn a good income? It may be so in the past - but not anymore.<br><br>You know why there are so many recrutiment ads looking for car salesman? You think it's because too many sales to handle?<br><br>WRONG! It's because not enough sales - that's why need more salesman to cast the net! You know how cheap it is to feed a sales man? $400 to $1K only (depending on which dealership)! If the salesman doesn't sell any car in the month, the company merely loses a few hundred dollars feeding his basic salary. However, if the salesman sell one car for the company, he helped the company make a profit of tens of thousands of dollars! That is why when sales is down, dealerships just take the easy way out by recruiting, recruiting, recruiting.<br><br>And you see how the car market is like now? So quiet! You read the news report that less people scrapping cars now? That means less people changing car. That means every year got lesser COE released (cos less cars being scrapped every year). That means COE price keep going up. That means car price keep going up. That means even less incentive to change car..<br><br>And some people think that a car salesman earn $3k to $7k for each car. Crap man! I tell you, it's not even 10% of that most of the time.<br><br>The pie is so small already, now more and more salesman come and eat.. You know I have seen how many salesman on duty during a Saturday or Sunday at Toyota Leng Kee Road? 46! Wah piang if you suay suay serve a lousy prospect during your turn, you have to wait for another 45 turns! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
