            <div class='col-md body'>hey all, this is my first post here as all of you can see from my post counts. anyway, straight to the point. got my license 1 week back and itching to drive a personal car (u should noe the initial euphoria) so i was thinking of purchasing a car.<br><br>im 19 this year (NSF) i should be able to get a car that costs me below 30k and minus off monthly installments (200+), minus off road tax (100+), minus off car insurance(100+), and i should be able to spend approximately 200-250 on petrol per month. with regards to all these in mind, i will have around 500$ left for monthly expenses.<br><br>ok so i need your opinions on whats the perfect car for me. im currently thinking about COE Cars about 10years+ old for around 10 to 15k and last me until about 2011. i'll have a hard time finding one which has acceptable bodykits, internal and external conditions and also ensuring its not a problematic one though. (im kinda like a perfectionist which is bad in this case)<br><br>or i have another option which is getting a second hand car which is almost new but cheap. probably the Kia Picanto? though i'll have to settle for 1.1l instead of 1.6 and better that i can get from the COE cars, i can have a piece of mind on the conditions of the car.<br><br>which is better for me or are there any other better options? (other than not getting one) haha. perhaps suggestions on any other cars i can get for below 30k?<br><br>THANKS ALL IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR HELP!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not advisable for a 19 year old. unless u can get yr dad buy insurance for u, get him sponsor u petrol once in a while. car is only for convenience. every year depreciate 10%, now u dun see it only, but after a while, quite heart pain. just use your family's car if there is any.<br><br>once u get a car, u will want to mod it and buy extra good products for it. these accounts to maintenance fees. petrol, u may pump ron98 cuz supposedly, more expensive petrol = better quality. way to cut cost for petrol is to get those bank discounts or whatever.<br><br>dont forget parking fees when u go out, ERP and coupons. i spend abt 60-70 bucks on parking monthly, and this is when i dont drive to sch. i only use the car after sch. and it's also when sometimes i nv put coupon or find spots where i dun need pay for parking.<br><br>u also wont know when u will get into an accident or maybe slightly bump or scratch your car.<br><br>all these indefinite things add up to alot of money. seriously consider it first and have a talk with your parents.<br><br>or be like me, use my dad's spare car at home!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

(im kinda like a perfectionist which is bad in this case)<br><br>or i have another option which is getting a second hand car which is almost new but cheap. probably the Kia Picanto? though i'll have to settle for 1.1l instead of 1.6 and better that i can get from the COE cars, i can have a piece of mind on the conditions of the car.<br><br>which is better for me or are there any other better options? (other than not getting one) haha. perhaps suggestions on any other cars i can get for below 30k?<br><br>THANKS ALL IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR HELP!!</div></blockquote>You should earn some more $ before thinking of getting a car.Road tax,insurance,erp,parking, etc.<br>Once you have enough,I do not advise you to get a COE car as these offer less protecton in an accident(which drivers around your age are prone to).Since you want a 1.6 car,how about a 2001 car(during the $101 COE period).They are going for a few k less than 30k.Warning:these cars might drink</div>
