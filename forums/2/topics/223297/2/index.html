            <div class='col-md body'>First time drive is like that. I only got my own car after more than10 years. After driving a few times, my new car got some slight scratch here and there <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">. Heart felt pain pain that time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">. But after some time ok liao.<br><br>You must remember that it takes time to feel the car, it's length, width, height, accelerator, brakes, etc... So it's important that u drive the car to get the feeling of the car.<br><br>Feel the internals first, the handle, brakes, accelerator, buttons for signal, mirrors. Drive around quiet road and get a feel of these. Then proceed on feel the length (front and back), width of the car. These are more difficult and could take some time but is also very important esp in avoiding scratches! By being able to feel the size of the car, u will know how far forward to go, when to turn, etc... Learning to park the car will help to u to understand this.<br><br>Good luck.<br></div>
