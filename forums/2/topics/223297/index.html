I know sometimes its frustating to see your Dad nagging. But after a while. You can drive well. Dun forget to check blind spot too and be very careful with Bikers and pedestrians. Keeping a long distance from the car infront of you helps too<br><br></div>

I have passed my TP test with 8 points.. Good results right? a lot of ppl and frens actually congrates me.. and i am quite satsified with myself.<br><br>The next day i passed the test, i drove my DAD car, toyota camry.. Can u imagine? from a HONDA CITY TO TOYOTA CAMRY? the transition was like .. HUGE.. . okie.. thats not the point. My dad asked me to drive his car.. basically jus round the basement carpark in my house. then he asked me to do a parking.. U NOE WAD. THE side mirror LONG TIO the pillar!! I was so shocked and frightened at that time.. and scratches along the car body.. sad right,,now i have phobia in driving le..<br><br>OKie.. not only that, while drivin on the road, I was like so despair and not cofident at all.  I cant drive based on my basic instinct. I have to follow my dad's instructions here and then. and he will keep on scolding and scolding throghout the whole journey. Sometimes i realli wonder, did the tester realli tink  i can drive? am i suitable to fit that license?<br><br>Am i fit to be a driver. ??<br><br>I have sigh up for the driver's orientation lesson. Hopefully i will gain back my confidence. </div></blockquote>Don't lose heart.  It happens to all new drivers.  All you need to do is to keep practising your driving skill at different road conditions - during the day, night, rainy days etc.<br><br>Don't rely on your mirror all the time, turn your head when necessary as some mirrors don't show the actual distance between the car and the object.  Also, the object may have been in your blind spot.  The same applies when changing lane - always remember to turn your head to see if the lane you are going to get into is free.  Looking at the side mirror alone won't help.<br><br>Just drive carefully and slowly (don't speed) and I am sure after much practice it'd build up your confidence.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

For someone who hasnt driven a car for a long time after gettting their licence, how does it feel? How long did you take to master it? Were you super nervous the first time that you drove after sooo long?<br><br>For you, it's not so bad... for some of my friends, they never got a chance to drive for years after they got their licence... I dunno how they are going to pick up driving again.... For me, I started driving quite frequently after I got my licence and there were already so many other things to learn... But as with other seasoned drivers, as time goes by, it all becomes driving habits and basic instincts...</div>
