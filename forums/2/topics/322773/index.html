              <h1 class="clr">Car owners can encash PARF and COE rebates from September</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Car owners will now have the option to exchange their
              Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) and the Certificate of
              Entitlement (COE) rebates for cash.</p>
              <p>The change follows a government review of the rebates to make it
              easier for motorists to give up their cars and switch to public
              transport.</p>
              <p>From September 1, registered owners of unused and
              valid PARF/COE rebates can apply to the Land Transport Authority for
              encashment.</p>
              <p>Once their applications are processed, they will receive a refund equivalent to the rebate amount.</p>
              <p>To
              facilitate the implementation of this change, PARF/COE rebates with
              expiry dates between July 1 and September 29 will be extended to the
              end of September.</p>
              <p>Those affected will be informed of the revised expiry dates within the next two weeks.</p>
              <p>Motorists who wish to use their PARF/COE rebates to offset the upfront taxes for a new vehicle can continue to do so.</p>
              <p>The LTA says it will continue to issue rebates to car owners upon de—registration of their vehicles.</p>
              <p>The rebates will remain transferable and valid for 12 months to provide flexibility to vehicle owners.</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Raymond Lim had announced in March this year that the government would be reviewing the PARF and COE rebates.</p>
              <p>This was to tie in with the overall effort to make public transport a choice mode for all commuters, including car owners. — CNA/yb</p>

              <div class="gwt-HTML">It has taken more than 30 long years for the MIWs to wake up and make the U-turn on their jealously held belief.<br><br>The appeal for cash rebate was continuously given the outright rejection by the MIWs year after year.<br><br>It must be due to the fear factor in the minds of the MIWs.<br><br>What was that fear?<br><br>The MIWs harboured the unfounded fear that it could be a run on the 'govt bank' if cash rebate was allowed.  <br><br>To
              stop that from happening, the MIWs flatly refused to refund in cash and
              preferred to make the motorists suffer when they sell that LTA rebate
              paper to car dealers at a cash discount. <br><br>It was a policy
              riding on the attitude that the motorists who dumped in the money have
              to pay for the loss when they quit. The motorists suffered silently for
              30 long years.<br><br>In the MIWs' mind, the thousands of millions of
              PARF and COE, once paid into the govt's coffer should become govt's
              revenue and it would be unthinkable to allow cash refund. <br><br>Cash
              refund would be massive cash bleeding on the govt's coffer. Once cash
              is in the coffer, that is it, no return, one way ticket.<br><br>That was the sad intransigent stand by the MIWs for 30 long years due to that fear. <br><br>It was an unfounded fear.  <br><br>It was a 'common banker's type of kiasu mentality fearing that cash rebate could lead to a run on the coffer'.  <br><br>Money
              is king. Money once in the govt's coffer stays in the coffer. But it
              was not an equitable policy if not why this U-turn after 30 long years?
              Has anything changed to push for the MIWs to make this U-turn? It is
              just that the fear factor has been removed.<br><br>This U-turn shows
              that the MIWs still have many 'kiasu fear-factor mentality' to dump for
              them to improve in their art of governing and for them to close the gap
              between the governed and govern.<br><br>10 years to 2018.  <br><br>If
              the MIWs make more efforts to address the 'kiasu mentality in
              governing', they stand a good chance not to invite the freak election
              result, which is of concern to MM.<br><br>The solution to prevent freak result is to make U-turns to remove the 'kiasu mentality and fear-factor of governing'.  <br><br>If this is not addressed, it will be RWYS.</div>
