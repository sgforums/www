            <div class='col-md body'>little word of advice for u. dun spend the effort answering back to the insults la. not like spending time doing that will help u get the car. start to go n call around already, checking the insurance companies out. maybe (a BIG MAYBE) if u're lucky u can find someone willing to evem insure anyone under 28 for a turbo car. this is a forum only, at the end of the day u also dunno whose face is behind whose nick, and all these insults aren't going to make your daddy decide not to spend money on u afterall, so u bother for what? like i said, go put in some effort towards helping u get the car. effort doesn't have to be financial only. if u are willing to look for the insurance and find someone who will insure u on your own, thats also good effort. getting something for no effort is a bit pointless. and oh, learn to swallow your pride n focus on whats important.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wth man. Seriously guys, some of you should really grow up. It's not as if he said "haha you cb poor fck my laopeh got more money than yours and can buy me evo!! fcuk off cause you're poor!"<br><br>Don't tell me if your daddy were rich and he would buy you a car that you liked, and you were only 19, you would reject it? I highly doubt many of you would say, "no i want to work hard and get my own money till i can afford one". People's father rich, son asking for advice, also kena fcuked? Wth man, it's almost as if anytime anyone asks for advice about getting a new car which might seem exotic or sporty, sure to get flamed. If he has the luck of driving an Evo at the age of 19 then good for him lah, I'd be happy cause another car nut got what he wants. Don't tell me you wouldn't be happy if you got the car of your dreams. Singaporeans generally love discounts and free things so don't bullshit please. And what about all those lucky draw participants who won car and prizes and all? They also should get flamed, if things went according to your principles, right?<br><br>Come on lah, people ask for advice only and some of you start getting all worked up, for fcuk? Give him the advice he's seeking and that's it lah, if he doesn't want to accept, what can you do? You chose to reply to his post without him or anyone pointing a bloody gun at your head, so prepare to accept it if he doesn't want to take your advice.<br><br>Heng: Agree with you that most people would prefer the faster machine. I personally would really love to have a Super AYC car too, but it's just a personal preference for me I guess when I said I would take the mechanical differential. In a race, of course, I would rather have the fastest car  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But let's say you and another guy race, skills are almost on par, and you beat him in a GT rather significantly while he's in a GSR, wouldn't that be more gratifying? Not trying to state a rhetorical question, but just curious about your personal opinion. Thanks!</div>
