            <div class='col-md body'>Of all cars why EVO? Unless you have chiongster friends who all own either WRX or EVO then shiok. but being 19, I think it's unlikely. In Singapore, you can't speed either. But it's your choice since it's your money. God Bless You!</div>

It's not as if he said "haha you cb poor fck my laopeh got more money than yours and can buy me evo!! fcuk off cause you're poor!"<br><br>Don't tell me if your daddy were rich and he would buy you a car that you liked, and you were only 19, you would reject it? I highly doubt many of you would say, "no i want to work hard and get my own money till i can afford one". People's father rich, son asking for advice, also kena fcuked? Wth man, it's almost as if anytime anyone asks for advice about getting a new car which might seem exotic or sporty, sure to get flamed. If he has the luck of driving an Evo at the age of 19 then good for him lah, I'd be happy cause another car nut got what he wants. Don't tell me you wouldn't be happy if you got the car of your dreams. Singaporeans generally love discounts and free things so don't bullshit please. And what about all those lucky draw participants who won car and prizes and all? They also should get flamed, if things went according to your principles, right?<br><br>Come on lah, people ask for advice only and some of you start getting all worked up, for fcuk? Give him the advice he's seeking and that's it lah, if he doesn't want to accept, what can you do? You chose to reply to his post without him or anyone pointing a bloody gun at your head, so prepare to accept it if he doesn't want to take your advice.<br><br>Heng: Agree with you that most people would prefer the faster machine. I personally would really love to have a Super AYC car too, but it's just a personal preference for me I guess when I said I would take the mechanical differential. In a race, of course, I would rather have the fastest car  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But let's say you and another guy race, skills are almost on par, and you beat him in a GT rather significantly while he's in a GSR, wouldn't that be more gratifying? Not trying to state a rhetorical question, but just curious about your personal opinion. Thanks!</div></blockquote>Kron, that 'you are just jealous' post from him got me a bit. i'm guilty of being petty. pai seh.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It improves my chances of winning, and I might not have to take as many risks as I would have to in the lesser car. Lets face it, when racing, a win is a win.</div>

It's not as if he said "haha you cb poor fck my laopeh got more money than yours and can buy me evo!! fcuk off cause you're poor!"<br><br>Don't tell me if your daddy were rich and he would buy you a car that you liked, and you were only 19, you would reject it? I highly doubt many of you would say, "no i want to work hard and get my own money till i can afford one". People's father rich, son asking for advice, also kena fcuked? Wth man, it's almost as if anytime anyone asks for advice about getting a new car which might seem exotic or sporty, sure to get flamed. If he has the luck of driving an Evo at the age of 19 then good for him lah, I'd be happy cause another car nut got what he wants. Don't tell me you wouldn't be happy if you got the car of your dreams. Singaporeans generally love discounts and free things so don't bullshit please. And what about all those lucky draw participants who won car and prizes and all? They also should get flamed, if things went according to your principles, right?<br><br>Come on lah, people ask for advice only and some of you start getting all worked up, for fcuk? Give him the advice he's seeking and that's it lah, if he doesn't want to accept, what can you do? You chose to reply to his post without him or anyone pointing a bloody gun at your head, so prepare to accept it if he doesn't want to take your advice.<br><br>Heng: Agree with you that most people would prefer the faster machine. I personally would really love to have a Super AYC car too, but it's just a personal preference for me I guess when I said I would take the mechanical differential. In a race, of course, I would rather have the fastest car  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But let's say you and another guy race, skills are almost on par, and you beat him in a GT rather significantly while he's in a GSR, wouldn't that be more gratifying? Not trying to state a rhetorical question, but just curious about your personal opinion. Thanks!</div></blockquote>seriously, give me a choice to get an evo... i rather have a bike  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>but then, i'd be happy just letting them eat dust from my haya</div>
