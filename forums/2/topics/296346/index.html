            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday in Hougang there is a taxi picking his fare along a two-way single lane road... I cut into the opposite lane to overtake the taxi. Just as I was about to overtake him, he drove off too and thus we were driving together with me on the opposite lane . I tap my horn to signal to him to let me over take as there is an on coming truck some 50 m away ... I speed up and over took him. We came to a traffic junction when I turned my head to see the taxi driver.<br><br>The Indian man was gesticulating with his hand and I know he was saying I overtook him or something like that .... what the fark is he doing, he is stopping to pick up passenger and he should have the basic courtesy to let other vehicle passed him safely before moving off ... his action is already wrong and he still want to pick a quarrel ... does all taxi driver do that ???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if both of you are head-to-head, and there isn't much space ahead to overtake safely, juz slow down and go behind the cab lo... I don't see what's the fuss that you have to tap horn for the cab driver to let you overtake... As he moved off, he won't be able tell that you were trying to overtake him since you wasn't in front of him. All he can see is that you are another car on the next lane.<br><br>Less than 50m and the cab having juz moved off from stationary, you are still neck-to-neck with him? That's far too slow of you right. By right if you are already moving and you cut out while the cab juz started moving, you would have more than ample clearance to overtake him.</div>

As part of defensive driving, if you see a vehicle neck-to-neck with you and there's an obstacle in front, you should be slowing down and be ready to either come to a stop or go behind the vehicle when it is safe to do so. And not be insisting on wanting to overtake in front.<br><br>As a vehicle that just moved off, how would he know that a vehicle on the next lane is trying to overtake? Does that mean that if you see a chain on vehicles on the next lane you should never move off even though your lane is clear? It is the responsibility of the overtaking vehicle to check if there's sufficient clearance.<br><br>Yes the cab driver could have done better to allow you to overtake first, but you have also erred in believing that you must overtake the cab. What's wrong with waiting behind the stationary lorry until it is clear to shift back to your previous lane? Your action has endangered your car, the cab as well as the lorry.</div>

Does that mean that if you see a chain on vehicles on the next lane you should never move off even though your lane is clear? It is the responsibility of the overtaking vehicle to check if there's sufficient clearance.<br><br>Yes the cab driver could have done better to allow you to overtake first, but you have also erred in believing that you must overtake the cab. What's wrong with waiting behind the stationary lorry until it is clear to shift back to your previous lane? Your action has endangered your car, the cab as well as the lorry.</div></blockquote>I am not insisting to overtake .. I tap my horn to sound to him I was next to him and is overtaking ... if situation is bad, well surely I would let him go ..  there is no point getting hurt ..  what I am trying to say is, I tap the horn as a signal .. I wasn't blasting the horn or what .. he should in the first place give way as he had first inconveinent someone ... then why stare and start gestering here and there ...  I mean is this right in the first place ...  some say I road hog, yes indeed I seldom speed as I do not see the need to ...  Singapore is a small country, how fast can you go ?</div>
