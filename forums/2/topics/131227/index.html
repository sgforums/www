            <div class='col-md body'>I post this topic, to highlight the lack of Terms or Rules governing the use of these Loading &amp; Unloading Bays in HDB Estates.<br><br>You all are likely to be familiar with the Loading &amp; Unloading Bay in HDB Estates, there's usually a sign that says in proper and simple English "No Waiting &amp; No Parking", and more likely than not, you'd see a motorbike, a van, a car, or even some rubbish from renovation occupying it.<br><br>Now, I recently parked my vehicle in one, left it to collect some goods from an apartment to load into the vehicle. Returning 20 minutes later, I find a ticket title NOTICE OF INTENDED PROSECUTION, and $100 fine.<br><br>A check via email with HDB detailed me a reply that states;<br>The purpose of the loading and unloading bays are for motorists to park<br>their vehicle temporarily when carrying out loading and unloading<br>activities. Motorists have to move their vehicles to designated parking lot<br>after completing such activities.<br><br>I asked in reply;<br>While I understand the standing rule is that, the Loading &amp; Unloading bays are for motorists to park their vehicles temporarily when carrying out loading and unloading activities, but I wish to ask, how long is 'temporarily'? The signboard says No Waiting, or Parking, but it lacks indication of time frame allowed. Or perhaps, a good consideration would be the deployment of parking meters for loading and unloading bays? It would make a parking offence less arguable, and the infringment, more outright.<br><br>So far and to date, I haven't got a reply.<br><br>In my opinion, the rules governing the use of these Loading &amp; Unloading bays are at best, rather vague and ill-defined. Hence this facility is like a fish trap; in that it is used only in the best of the public's knowledge - if your vehicle happened to be parked there, and you're not around, you shall be assumed to have committed an offence.<br><br>In my suggestion to HDB vide email, I seeded the idea of implementing parking meters with integrated barriers controlled by time limit, and pointed out that this method would be beneficial to both the public and HDB. Although, I doubt that they'd consider my suggestion viable.<br><br>In any case, let me hear your views about these Loading and Unloading Bay in HDB Estates. Note that at anytime, most Loading and Unloading bays are occupied by some vehicle - loading or unloading or not. Each incident when caught, whenever the parking enforcement units are deployed in that area, a sizeable number of tickets can be harvested.<br><br>Is this FAIR to us?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry to say this, loading bay is only meant for these purpose. no cars or motorcycle, bicycles, scooters should be park at all time.<br><br>imagine if your vehicle parked there and some construction work hitted your car, then who's fault is it?<br><br>i know most of the drivers will be tempted at the big spacing to park their vehicles, so you are not the 1st one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think HDB shd state the time allowed.<br><br>I mean who will purposely unload the goods then park their car, then they carry the goods again. It is a waste of time.<br><br>Why not juz let unload the goods and carry them all the way up. In this way, i think i would be faster.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe L/UL bay is not for u to disappear from the car and bring things upstairs. It's more like u can park there and start taking things off the car, and let other people carry it upstairs.<br><br>Like for example for movers, as they can't park elsewhere conveniently while having to unload so many things.<br><br>Mebe carry an empty carton inside ur car.. when u park there, put e carton outside the car, make it look like u doing L/UL activities <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As I've stated; Parking Regulations governing use of these Loading &amp; Unloading Bays, are at best vague, and inflexible.<br><br>For instance, a shop owner at my estate who uses the LUL bay gets fined almost monthly. The replies was that he should practically climb up and down the MSCP when unloading goods, or if and when required, go up to fetch his van in order to load goods. He was even given a ticket while he was in the van with engine runnning, becuase he fell asleep inside van.<br><br>What the heck happened to COMMON SENSE?<br><br>I am in the process of getting HDB Carparks division to instill more sensibility into their Parking Regulations with regards to the use of these bays. Otherwise I'm suggesting that they demolish all of them.<br><br>The options are there for HDB to issue business or shop owners additional seasonal fees for the use of the LUL during business hours (9-6pm) and likewise for home business owners. Or, install parking meters with an integrated ground-up barrier activated after period of parking time paid for is up.<br><br>PRICE/FARE INCREASES and FINES, can't always be their universal solution.<br><br></div>
