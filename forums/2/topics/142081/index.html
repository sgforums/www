In the first place, you are in the wrong. Under the traffic act, they are authorised to tow your vehicle away and the charges are acceptable. Have anyone appeal that while speeding, they are given, for example, 6 demerit points and fine $120. You can write to them say why not just 2 points and fine $60? No right? Then why you still write to them.
