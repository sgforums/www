            <div class='col-md body'>Hrmm... maybe can try another trick on those type of motorist. Confirm sure let them die one. Take 2 x size23 bolt and tie it with a 100lbs fishing line with the 2 bolt on both end. length about 50cm. drive beside it... open window aim at the front tyre. succes rate should be quite high if you aiming is good. . let the front wheel entangled.Confirm the whole bike will fly one... hehe... But den again.. make sure there are no witness and the motorist is confirm dead. If not... get ready to go to jail. few yrs back, in JB got 1 such case. The motorist died but the driver who threw the thing was seen by another car driver at the back and reported to the police.</div>
