It's curved at the top and flat at the bottom..and if you look closely at most of the spoilers on cars, it's just like an upside down wing..so it's flat at the top and curved at the bottom..lol..</div></blockquote>The plane wing,is an aerofoil .The aerofoil shape creates lift or 'upforce'.But cars need downforce,so upside down</div>
