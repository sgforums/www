Chery then gave him a replacement fuse to get home. However, the fuse blew AGAIN and so the car cannot start again and thus he was stuck there. There was nothing much I could do about a blown fuse so I just asked if he had called a tow truck. He said ya and then I just let him know that I couldn't help la cos I thought maybe he just needed to borrow another car's battery to jumpstart.. oh well..<br><br>However, I must say that for a new car's fuse to blow, twice, is really terrible..
