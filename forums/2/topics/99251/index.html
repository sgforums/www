Raining like no tomorrow, travelling average speed of 150km/h in a rented toyota corolla 5 door altise.  Couldn't see sh|t, its just long straightways and small bends.

Drivers also siong, got midnight details n outfield camo tonner wif baka pole n huge camo nets.<br><br>As for the heavy rain, unless got sum big umbrella, if not got to rely on ur senses n stick to ur lane. its frequent lane changing when in heavy rain that cause accidents (together wif the skidding) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Not to mention putting up with the soldiers who hurl vulgarities at you when you E brake and send them flying to the front of the Tonner... hehe...<br><br>Yo Khid, you want to drift the tonner?

            <div class='col-md body'>this maybe a stupid suggestion or a crazy thing to do..<br><br>well.. my driving instructor told me that wearing sunglasses during such nights really help alot.. i've tried it for a few minutes before.. it really cleared my vision alot although its really dark.. took it off because i was afraid TP might stop me and give me a ticket..<br><br>the sunglass filters majority of the reflection.. thus making it easier to see..<br><br></div>
