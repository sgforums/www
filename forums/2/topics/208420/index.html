            <div class='col-md body'>The general rule of thumb is to try to take as short a loan as possible - preferably 3 years.  Max. 5 years.  Because most people sell their cars after 5 years anyway.<br><br>NEVER take a 10 year loan - I know lots of people who get trapped by it.  As many people have already said:  Financing for a car can be a very tricky trap!<br><br>But first, threadstarter, you must realise that when you take a loan, the credit company/bank will ask you for documents showing your income, etc.  They must know that you can pay back (logically, they can't loan money to someone without a stable and sufficient income).<br><br></div>

But you see, the first problem still remains.  The credit company will ask you for you pay slip....or your CPF contribution for the last 6 months, etc.<br><br>Credit companies assigns loans based on what you're earning.....not what you're gonna earn.<br><br>I suggest that the best way now is to call up the credit company or car agent, etc....to ask if you are able to take a loan in your position right now.<br><br>You might want to know that there have been cases recently where buyers have given a downpayment to reserve his car.  Then after he couldn't find a credit company which will give him a loan (although he had a job).  He lost his thousands of dollars of deposit.<br><br>I know the urge to own a car and I don't mean to burst your bubble.....but some down-to-earth sensibility is very important for cases like these.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at your situation, the car's gotta go under your chick's name to secure the loan as she is the one working. However, at your age, I would refrain from doing so. Because many things could happen in the next few years in terms of your relationship. If you folks break up (touch wood), the car's gonna belong to who? You or her? Are you gonna have any underwriting to safeguard yourself?<br><br>I hope I did not digress and have given u some useful insights and advice.<br>Cheers.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bathtub:</div><div class="quote_body">hi guys<br><br>hm maybe I can divulge abit about our financial status.<br><br>For myself, I am already 'bonded' with my sponsoring company and left 1 more year to graduate.
