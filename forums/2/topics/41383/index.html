Meaning they only have to pay OMV and pay about 50-70cents/litre on petrol.<br><br>Humvees are not meant for speeding but they are damn good for transporting a heavy load (try towing an artillery piece with a 1.5 litre Soluna). The have a low horsepower rating but high torque. Vehicles that runs on diesel has these charateristics.<br><br>Also, there are petrol (gasoline) versions of Humvees meant for consumer use.<br><br>Humvees are designed according to military specs, so they dun tend to be very comfortable to sit in. Hummer 2 is more for the consumer use, that's why they have a smaller engine, higher power output and more spacious.</div>
