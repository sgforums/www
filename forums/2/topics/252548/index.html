In both cases they were driven by [b]professional drivers</strong>.....<br><br>and if u are really interested in max figures... the 0-100 for the current GTi is 7.2 and 7.5 for the DC5R in the spec sheet......<br>GTi is 1320kgs and the Type R 1186kg (the WRX 1400kg).<br><br>vw has a tuned R version for the gti too known as the GTi VS4R... isnt it only fair that we compare the dc5r to this... or rather the normal gti to the type s instead...<br><br>As for the WRX vs gti.... the stock wrx handles poorer than a stock gti... sure u might say its down to the driver... but if all things equal... the gti will emerge the winner on a track.. though it might no outrun it in the straights....<br><br>Expensive as it may sound.... you pay for what you get.... Better build quality... better materials... better refinement... better handling... and how others view u as a person...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DC5R should win cos the power to weight ratio is better as compare to WRX.. Power loss also more for the WRX since its a AWD,DC5R is a FWD.. As some have mention,there is turbo lag for the WRX,DC5R althought is without the turbo but it has a close-ratio gearbox which will helps in acceleration..<br>If the DC5R will to do up some mods like changing of final drive,an ECU,air-filter n etc.. Might be able to par with an stock STi.. still depends alot on the driver and launching skill.</div>
