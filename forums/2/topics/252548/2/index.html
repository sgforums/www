            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder how does the Golt GT fare on N-S highway speeds of up to 220km/h. It is essentially a 1.4l utilising SC/TC to look good on paper spec. At the end of the day, the capacity of a 1.4l will mean the emphasis on SC/TC power to deliver the paper stated sprint times and top speed. On larger TC cars, you can afford to cruise off boost like any NA 2.0l cars. But in order for the 1.4l to keep up with a normal NA2.0l would mean the 1.4l working much harder, or even being on boost at all time.<br><br>What does this aspect translate to durability of engine life and parts as well as overall comfort of driving the car at such loads? I am sure this engineering marvel is not without some compromise. From a costing perspective, the inclusion of a seperate turbo-charger and super-charger would have already upped costs to the levels of providing a basic 2.0l engine with a light pressure TC to attain a modest 170bhp such as those in the Passat. So the marketing pivot point of this feat seems to revolve around lower tax brackets enjoyed by lower engine capacity rather den a pure power gain exercise.<br><br>At around S$100k mark, perhaps all it would attract is the budget conscious executive looking for a hot hatch with low maintenance. Cos if you could afford it, i am sure you would have chosen the Golt GTi anytime instead.</div>
