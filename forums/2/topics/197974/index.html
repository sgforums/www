            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I need some advise from you all.<br><br>I'm 19 this year and just passed my license 4 months ago. I rented with this car rental company with good experiences 2 times ago. But my 3rd time was bad.<br><br>They gave me this lancer and after a few hours of driving, the transmission gave way. This is my story.<br><br>I was running around 70+km/h and was approaching the traffic light which was turning to red. I did engine breaking from 3rd gear to 2nd gear. But upon down shifting to 2nd gear, there was a loud pop sound followed by a burned smell. I knew something bad has happened. When the light turned green, I tried to pick up with all the gears but I'm only rolling slowly. So I stopped the vehicle and took a look at the engine bay. No smoke but just burn smell. So I called their 24hr Help line and got the car towed to the workshop, and got me another car. I asked if i'm liable for the damage, they say we talk the next day.<br><br>The next day when I returned the car, they told me that I have to share half of the repair cost with them. I don't think is fair to pay as I'm just doing normal driving and the tranny gave way. I'm not speeding or whatever so.<br><br>So what are your opinions? Please share..

No, you should not pay.  They should be thankful that you did not claim from them for loss of usage.</div>

And for most cars, the cars are insured and the rental company can file a claim with the insurance company... You don't need to pay...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Always remember to rent from the better companies. Although the cost may be more but they do make it a point for you to have a workable car during the duration of rental.<br>By the way how long was the car with you?<br>Usually there will be a lose of power when the clutch, or the transmition gives way. Basically you just choose to ignore it and continue to drive. That is extremely dangerous if you are on a road with fast moving traffic.  Always insist that you can do it cheaper outside (which in fact you will be able to)<br></div>
