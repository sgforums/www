I'm going there to get the freebies... heh heh and mayb go in the evening, they should have a practice session inthe evening if I'm not wrong.<br><br>You coming Heng@??<br>Oh, read your post on the race in up north. Not bad considered you can overtake that Malaysia representative, that'll show them us Singaporeans still got some stuff and not some rundown roadkills. A very good job out there Heng@!! Practice more, and you'll be able to win that ang mo and get into the top 3 ranks.<br><br>Saw pics of you too, maybe you need to reduce a couple of kgs off your body to lighten up, every bit counts in motorsport, it'll also give you a slight improvement in acceleration.<br><br>Cheerz brother!!<br>Itz Tiger Time!!</div>

My decent result was helped by having a good machine for the race. many of the top drivers i fought with were having some small problem or another. these people, on a day with competitive machinery, blitz the opposition. and they aren't even in the national teams!<br><br>seriously. singapore, we have good drivers. and considering the lack of any official support, it is even more impressive. THEN consider the shoestring budget i was racing with. my 4000 was nothing compared to the tens and tens of thousands spent by the top teams.<br><br>as for me, yeah i have to lose a few kgs more. from this race i learnt that my endurance level was far from ideal. even though i manage to last the whole race distance for the finals, i had to soak myself with ice water b4 going out to drive. racing is a very physical sport, and i admit i have to work on that aspect more.<br><br>oh well boo, hope next event will actually happen. btw, sat, i was doing race marshalling at jurong for class 95's karting event. now i fried like fried fish liao.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
