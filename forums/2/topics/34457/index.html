One offer for the same make of car also from a Finance Company boss selling away a 2 year old car that belonged to his wife.<br><br>Everyone informed me that they do not charge 2% fee for scrapping the car, and wanted me to leave the car immediately, close the deal, and return the Road Tax when vehicle is scrapped.<br><br>The price offered is also very competitive, and same as offered by the Kallang Dealership that I bought the car from.<br><br>It seems that the margin on the used car is about $3000 to $4000 each, and the competition is so great amongst the Used Car Dealers that they fight for sale, and prepared to give away small service such as the 2% scrap fee.<br><br></div>
