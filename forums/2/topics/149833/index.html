Characteristics of The Great COE Scam<br><br>It is glaring that although Singapore has the world's most expensive<br>cars, the vast majority of car owners remain confounded by the<br>complicated pricing and ownership system. (See artcile from the New<br>Paper 14 Jan 2005 "COE, Parf, ARF - confused?")<br>http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/top/story/0,4136,81225,00.html?<br><br>In all developed countries, buying a car is a simple and transparent<br>affair that is concluded between buyer and seller. The only other<br>third-parties involved are the insurance company and the finance<br>company. In Singapore a series of bureaucratic shields and paperwork<br>complicate the process.<br><br>The system is massively complicated, designed to confuse the average<br>car buyer. The objective is to disguise the underlying scam which<br>involves siphoning funds from the car owner into the bloated coffers<br>of the government.<br><br>The latest tender saw car COE premiums ending at $18,400 (up to<br>1,600cc) and $14,002 (above 1,600cc) - the lowest in over a decade.<br>The government is set to release between 100,000 to 120,000 COEs this<br>year. At an average COE "price" of approx SGD16,201 per COE this<br>amounts to a whopping SGD1,944,120,000/- in COE revenue for the<br>government.<br><br>Although the supposed objective of the COE system was to regulate<br>traffic flow and reduce traffic congestion, a number of<br>characteristic reveal the actual COE scam which has the hidden<br>purpose of siphoning funds from car owners.<br><br>The scam is Revealed via the following formulae:<br><br>COE Revenue = COE Price X Number of COE issued.<br><br>Regardless of the price of the COE, the total COE revenue collected<br>remains generally stable at approx SGD1.994 billion. This is because<br>any fall in price is compensated by issuance of more COEs hence<br>keeping the COE revenue relatively stable.<br><br>Below are some of the characteristics of the COE scam:<br><br>1) The illusion created by the Scam is that the price of the COE<br>flustuates as a result of demand and supply. In reality Car Owners<br>are actually providing a buffer for the government and ensuring a<br>steady COE income stream.<br><br>2) The scam also effectively encourages Car Owners to scrap perfectly<br>good vehicles early. 3-4 year old cars in mint condition and<br>purchased at very high COE prices are scrapped early when COE prices<br>fall. With a greater number of vehicles "retired prematurely" the<br>government can then issue more COEs at lower prices creating the<br>illusion of a COE market that is driven by demand and supply.<br><br>In the above scenario, the constant that is maintained is the COE<br>revenue. In a market that is truly driven by Demand and Supply, a<br>fall in demand will eventually lead to a fall in supply which will<br>translate into reduced sales reveunes.<br><br>3) It is Impossible to actually own a car in Singapore.<br>To ensure continuity of the COE income stream, the PAP government has<br>effectively made freehold car ownership in Singapore impossible. Car<br>Owners never actually "own" the car per say, even after spending so<br>much money on a piece of paper, all they actually hold is a lease<br>giving them a conditional revocable right to drive a car for 10 years.<br><br>At the expiration of this lease, the COE certificate is either<br>renewed via payment of additional fees by current owner, or (in event<br>the old owner chooses not to renew the lease) it is "purchased" by a<br>new bidder. Either ways the PAP government is assured of a never<br>ending income stream.<br><br>4) The scam is also revealed when a car owner attempts to scrap<br>prematurely. The system does not allow the car owner a cash rebate on<br>the balance COE. Instead, the car owner has to purchase another car<br>(and another COE) and deduct his COE rebates from the final purchase<br>price. This ruse ensures that COE money remains with the government<br>even when a COE is scrapped prematurely, thus assuring them of a<br>steady income stream, albeit at the expense of car owners.<br><br>5) This ruse has been used successfully for over a decade in<br>conjunction with a series of other hidden "taxes" (like the ERP, CPF,<br>GST etc) all designed to provide a cheap and ready source of revenue<br>for undisclosed government activities.<br><br>6) The scam is given a veil of legitimacy with the support of laws<br>and regulations. The local government owned media regularly report<br>that the COE system "is tightly regulated and very competitive".<br><br>7) A plethora of technical terms are used also add layers to the scam<br>and hide the underlying ruse. Terms like "COE", "PARF", "ARF", "OMV"<br>etc.<br><br>The COE scam also works in conjunction with other scams and is part<br>of a more elaborate process. On top of the COE, car owners also have<br>to pay Road Tax (which is reasonable) and also ERP (Electronic Road<br>Pricing) which imposes a further cost for road usage.<br><br>So Car owners are penalized not just for leasing a car but also for<br>the road usage.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Other countries like Hong Kong also successfully control traffic<br>and the COE concept is conspicuously absent from these countries. In<br>fact in Hong Kong although there is a high cost to owning a car, this<br>is contained in the parking fees and charges which are paid to<br>landlords. The main difference here is that the parking fees are<br>collected by land lords and channeled back into the private sector.<br><br>In Singapore the COE revenues totaling SGD2 billion are channeled<br>directly into government coffers. No one knows what happens to this<br>massive amount of money.<br><br>9) How does the government justify the existence of such a system in<br>the first place? After years of implementation, the original<br>objective of the system (which was to control traffic congestion) has<br>long since been lost. Traffic jams are a common occurence all over<br>the island especially during peak hours and even the implementation<br>of additional penalties like the ERP have failed to address this<br>problem.<br><br>So what exactly are Singaporeans paying for when there is no concrete<br>proof for justification of the system? Such an obvious scam would<br>have risen many questioning eyebrows in other developed nations. But<br>here in Singapore part of the reason for the success in the deceit<br>lies in the social political circumstances which are unique only to<br>Singapore.<br><br>There is basically no accountability in government administration and<br>the political system effectively discourages any calls for<br>clarifications. Law suites are used as a convenient tool to silence<br>political opposition members and the international press.<br><br>After decades of indoctrination, local citizens have adopted a spirit<br>of apathy and unquestioning obedience to any enforced regulations and<br>policies. Indeed the government scammers are sound very legitimate.<br>They are usually polite, friendly, personable, sincere, convincing,<br>and controlling; formidable foes for more trusting average Car Owner.<br><br>10) Social and Psychological Indoctrination are important tools in<br>the scammers arsenal. In Singapore, a car has been portrayed by the<br>government as a "luxury item" in order to justify its high price.<br><br>On the other hand, government policies place immense pressure on<br>families to reproduce and more than one child. This, coupled with<br>uncertain employment (and high unemployment rates of 4.50% p.a.) have<br>necessitated dual income families with both spouses working long 12<br>hour work days. The hectic lifestyle and multiple roles of both<br>spouses (as wage earner, parents and care-takers of their own<br>parents) have rendered a car a very necessary asset.<br><br>11) Whilst the average con artist and scammer can be reported to the<br>authorities, how does one seek recourse when the local authorities<br>themselves are part of the elaborate hoax? The picture remains bleak<br>for Singaporeans as there seems no way out for them from this system.<br><br>12) According to a BBC article, not all scams are illegal by<br>definition. In fact some software scams are perfectly<br>legal. "Unscrupulous software suppliers have been taking advantage of<br>software license agreements to trick customers out of anything from<br>Â£10,000 to Â£100,000 plus. There is nothing illegal about it - some<br>of the world's largest software companies have been doing it to some<br>of the biggest companies in the world."<br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_economy/365065.stm<br><br>The COE scam falls within this special category.<br><br></div>
