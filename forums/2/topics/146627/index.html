            <div class='col-md body'>You people, do you know that challenging each other on the expressway is very dangerous? You endanger other road users!<br><br>I saw so many times; either two cars, or one car and a taxi, or, two vans, or one van and one lorry. Both leap frogging one another, cutting in each other's way. If one decides to jam brake, everyone else behind, will become victims.<br><br>It's selfish!<br><br>Like I said, get a digicam that can do video recording, plus a flashgun. No need to challenge each other. Let the party in front wonder what you have done with that flash of light, and also, with the video recording of his/her beautiful license plate and the way he/she drove. Present it to the Traffic Police, let them deal with these sorts of idiots.<br><br>Don't become one, yourself!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, when you do video recording at night, record in black and white only. Because in black and white, letters &amp; numbers appear clearer even though it's dark. Also, buy a video or digicam with night-recording ability.<br><br>I say good luck to all these crazy Taxi drivers and other idiotic morons on our roads. Try me, and I'll have the TP knocking at your door 4am in the morning!<br><br></div>
