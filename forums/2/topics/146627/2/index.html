If one decides to jam brake, everyone else behind, will become victims.<br><br>It's selfish!<br><br>Like I said, get a digicam that can do video recording, plus a flashgun. No need to challenge each other. Let the party in front wonder what you have done with that flash of light, and also, with the video recording of his/her beautiful license plate and the way he/she drove.
