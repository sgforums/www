            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, help me to make a decision. I am looking for a 2 years old used car. I have listed down this 3 models because they depreciate the most. Owning them as an 2nd hand is much better getting them brand new. They are all turbo charged, can easily boost them past 200 bhp with ECU change. And they are continentals.<br><br>2001 model can easily get for 85k to 95k they cost like hell for a brand new.<br><br>Which will you get and why?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally, i would chose Passat...just like the design.<br><br>The new Saab 95 is nice, but i am not too sure if the previous model 2 yrs ago looks as nice.<br><br>Not a bad idea to get these cars 2nd hand as the depreciation , as you  had correctly mentioned, is damn high. Again, you need to know twhy the first owners are selling their cars as well right? Heavy fuel consumption, poor servicing factors.etc...<br><br>BTW, for the volva, i think the S40 T4 looks really sporty as well.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Volvo N saab are very expensive to maintain.NOt much moddabliltiy..not like a passat. U can mod a passat ,the TIp is smooth &amp; fuel consumption is decent. it feels well n has that conti beefy feeling. Saab 9-3 is light n very linear. u dun feel the turbo surge n frankly doesnt offer much feedback steering feel.all these cars unfortunately doenst offer much resale..so buying 2nd hand makes economic sense.U wud lose a lot if u buy new. Road tax is lower for passat as it is 1.8T. There are few workshops that specialised on VW, saab N volvo most of the time u hav to bring back to agents. But their service is ok lar. Maintenance is not so high as manual says u need to change oil once a year.depending on engine condition. FYI, one chip(stage one) on ur passat T will it from 150BHP to 204BHP!! like a new car!<br>If u like , u can meet up wz the passats owners grp n hav a chat wz them. Very likely they wud let u hav a feel of their car..of coz u must ry the stock one wz 150BHP..to have the stock feel. most of them hav SSBC, chipped,FMIC.Contrary to what certain bro here said, u CAN feel the accelaration of a passat becoz the torque is 210nm@1750rpm.<br>The S60 tends to float(surprise) at high speed n hard braking has lotsa vibes.<br>My 2 cents worth.<br>btw, the dash lights in the passat is a sexy blue at night..mmmm?<br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got a colleague bought a wrx sti for 6 months and sold off at a loss of 40k excluding mod. Reason, too much mod until it wasn't reliable anymore. Furthurmore everyone is complaining it is too moisy. Well at least enjoyed for 6 months. Now he is drving a BMW 330i, no one complain. Power and comfort = lots of $$$.<br><br>Too bad, I cannot consider WRX or Evo8, although I know they are good cars.<br><br>I want power and comfort, that is why I am thinking of turbo-charged sedan eg. Audi 1.8t, passat. At this moment I know I go loss big time on my audi that is why I am settling down for a 2nd hand car with huge depricitaion.<br></div>
