            <div class='col-md body'>helping a friend from subaru club. appreciate if there are any eye witnesses who happened to see this incident and willing to help. thanks!<br><br>original post here:<br>http://www.subaruclubsg.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=36441<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>Posted: Thu Dec 29, 2005 10:33 pm<br><br>Had an encounter at abt 2120hrs along SLE along woodland exit. was entering SLE from BKE and there was this MERC driver (50+ yr old man) in front of me. he was travelling in front of me in Lane 1. As I close up to him, he suddenly slowed down and then suddenly stop. imagine stopping in lane 1. naturally, I horned and highlighed him as those car behind me was also horning me and highlighting me.(Note: I had not highlighed at him b4 this nor was i too close to him, my car is still abt 1 car length away) . He then start to pick up his speed to 80 kmh. After traveling past the first exit to woodlands. I overtake him from the lane 2 as he is still in lane 1. I horned him again and show him with my hand with the intentation of asking him why did he brake suddenly. The next come unexpectedly. he suddenly swerved his car into my lane, forcing me to switch lane and nearly causing me to lost control of my car. this did not end, as I regained control of my car. he again swerved his car at me, forcing me to take evasive action again.this continue all the way until he force me off to the grass road side of woodland ave 12 exit. HE then stepped out of his car and accused me of highlighting at him and showing him the middle finger. I have my wife as witness that I did not show him the middle finger. but come on. if some one showed you a middle finger. does it warrant you to swerved into him and nearly cause him to have a accident. I try to calm him down, but he was very hot headed and took down my car nos and said that he is going to yishun police post to make a police report. I say fine, we can go together and I will also make a dangerous driving against him. Followed him all the way to sembawang, seem that he decided to go home and not to yishun as he headed into old sembawang road.<br><br>Went to sembawang NPC to make a police report . Had been advised to make a dangerous report against him tomorrow at UBI.<br><br>Would like to appeal for any witness that saw what happened to come forward and help me have a report of dangerous driving. there was a few cars behind us. luckily, I did not hit into anyone when he swerved into my lane.<br><br>He was driving a silver merc E240.Mine is a silver bugeye. Thanks<br><br>TO those that saw the action. you will see that he purposely swerved into my lane not once but quite a few time and you can see that I nearly lost control of my car swinging from away from him to avoid him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sounded familar!  around 2 years ago, on the CTE, there was this MERC (driven by a 50ish old man) also on the 1st lane.. travel very slow. I overtook him and he started tailgating me! As i move to the 2nd lane to let him pass, he cut in front of me and JAM BRAKE!!  I was so pissed, over took him again and signalled angrily (with my hands and facial expression, not middle finger coz i dun have the habbit of showing middle finger even when i am angry).  Following this, he started cutting INTO me again forcing me again to brake and evade him.  He kept doing this till I exit at AMK ave 3.<br><br>I cannot remember the reg number, but if my memory is right, the MERC shuold be an old (square lights) model.</div>
