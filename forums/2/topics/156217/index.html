If you seriously want to change, I would say go for a new model. Of course then you would be in loan again.<br><br>From Pi to Pi, although you seems like you got an extra year of driving it. But since you are loan-free in both cases, I seriously wonder when you will houbour the thought of scraping it in the future again.<br><br>If I were you, I keep the present Pi. Drive til I am sick of it, save up some money at the same time, go for a better car. Do note that a well-maintain seasoned car might drive better than a brand-new one.<br><br>For me, I did too much thing to my Kelisa that I wouldn't think of parting it now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think change old Pi to new Pi is ok. I got a friend intend to change old Sunny to new Sunny. but do consider when you want to sell off the new Pi.  Logic is by the time you want to sell new Pi, the scrap value can be lower than your old Pi even though it's a newer car.<br><br>e.g. COE was around 25k 1 year ago. So assuming you get new Pi with same OMV at lower COE of 12.5k and want to sell 3 years later, you old Pi can still get back COE rebate of 15k (6yrs left) while your new Pi will only get back COE rebate of 8.75k (7yrs left). Parf rebate for both old and new Pi the same, so you will be worse off at that time unless you can sell off your old Pi at 4k premium (not including body value).</div>

Moreover, at current low COE prices, not much room to go very much further down, so that means wonÂ’t get another chance to change car so soon without huge losses. Ask yourself if you want to stick to Pi or get a fresh start with a model that you like better for the many yrs ahead next.<br></div>

You will get back about 30k-35k from scraping. So if you don't mind being in Loan again, you could get a Civic that depreciate at about 5.5k per year. Sound more worth it right. Downside is you will be in loan again.</div></blockquote>That's what I was thinking but instead we are interested in getting a toyota vois. I don't like to loan, so will probably borrow from in-laws (cos they paid the first time for us and we repaid them later) or pay full the difference. Cos it's less than $15k difference.<br><br>Cos currently the calculations I made is that my COE depreciates at $3k+ per yr it's dumb to keep the car. What's more a manual car!<br><br>Agree?<br><br>Just a curious question, how much is a weekend car? how is it calculated? What timing is weekend cars?</div>

If you got a small car like mine, you will only enjoy S$400 rebate because my car's road tax is ~S$450, and the OPC road tax is at least S$50.<br><br>Secondly, if you count in the 17k rebate for the weekday voucher, you might as well get a normal plated car. So what my friend did is compared the saving from the road tax and concluded that he have 32 coupon to use per year. These would be a more convincing comparsion.<br><br>Other than the admin fee to convert your car to normal plate from OPC, the rest is petty much what you indicated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
