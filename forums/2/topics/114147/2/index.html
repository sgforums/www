Some sprinters have front brakes, but by and large, the sprinters I raced only have a single rear brake disc on the main axle. Since the rear axle is one solid rod, tat means there is no rear differential either. This makes things very very challenging indeed.</div>

It does make wear and tear higher, esp for the brake pads. I had fitted a set of new pads b4 the race in Kota Bahru. after that, they were almost worn down totally.<br>Also... there is the question of your line thru a corner. there r several different lines, depending on situation. this is where racecraft comes into play.</div>
