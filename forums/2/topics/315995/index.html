              <h1 class="clr">More drivers reporting CashCard woes at ERP gantries</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The next time you drive past an Electronic Road Pricing
              (ERP) gantry, make sure the IU in your car holding the CashCard does
              beep.</p>
              <p>A growing number of drivers here are having problems with their
              CashCards, according to inspection centres and drivers who spoke to
              TODAY.</p>
              <p>Drivers who fail to get their CashCards read at the
              gantries will be issued with notification letters by the Land Transport
              Authority (LTA), requiring them to pay up to $10 each time.</p>
              <p>Drivers
              who have had this problem before told TODAY that they initially thought
              it was due to a faulty in—vehicle unit (IU). But when they sent the IUs
              for a check at vehicle inspection centres, they were told the problem
              lay with their CashCards, which are issued by Nets.</p>
              <p>Common
              problems include faulty microchips on the CashCard after being exposed
              to heat for more than four hours, rust on the microchip and also
              accidental scratches on the card when a driver takes it in and out for
              carpark payments.</p>
              <p>TODAY also understands that the problems do not
              lie with just a particular batch of CashCards — some drivers who bought
              their CashCards two years ago experienced problems similar to those who
              bought theirs recently.</p>
              <p>Lawyer Mr S Lazim, 40, encountered his first CashCard problem at an ERP gantry three months ago.</p>
              <p>Technicians
              at Vicom, the car inspection and testing centre, later advised him to
              keep two cards with him at all times to prevent scratches when taking
              the CashCard in and out of the IU unit.</p>
              <p>But despite having a
              CashCard solely dedicated to the IU, he still had problems as he was
              driving past the ERP gantry at Prince Edward Road on Monday morning.</p>
              <p>"If you want to have a system, make sure its foolproof and not let consumers bear the inconvenience," said Mr Lazim, 40.</p>
              <p>Driver
              David Woo, 58, said he has no problems with the fact that Nets will
              start charging road users for a $5, non—refundable fee from today for
              their CashCards, which can last for up to five years.</p>
              <p>"If the
              card is able to last me for the next four years, paying five bucks is
              reasonable, but now the quality is questionable," added Mr Woo, who had
              received two notices from the LTA due to CashCard problems in the past
              two months.</p>
              <p>He now buys only the black—coloured version of the CashCards, which are said to be the hardier version.</p>
              <p>The CashCard woes have also found their way into forums dedicated to motorists, such as My Car Forum.</p>
              <p>One
              user, "Octaviafan", advises other motorists to keep separate cards for
              carpark payments while "Mavvy" told drivers to avoid some shopping
              centre carparks that are known to easily cause scratches on the card.</p>
              <p>Checks with some inspection centres indicated that the CashCard problem is something they deal with daily.</p>
              <p>At
              the STA Inspection centre, the number of CashCard cases seen by its
              technicians has risen from around two in the past to eight cases daily.</p>
              <p>However,
              some drivers believe that the figure could be higher because there are
              those who would rather pay the fee imposed by the LTA rather than go
              through the trouble of getting their vehicles inspected to confirm that
              their CashCards were the source of the problem.</p>
              <p>In response to
              TODAY’s queries, the LTA said CashCard error incidents comprise only
              0.004 per cent — or about 300 cases — out of the ERP transactions each
              month.</p>
              <p>According to the LTA, given the increase in the number of
              ERP road users, more problems are likely to crop up. However, it will
              work closely with Nets if there is indeed an increasing trend of
              CashCard—related problems.</p>
              <p>Relief may be in sight, though, for
              drivers with CashCard woes. Come year end, they will have the option of
              making ERP payments through credit cards and contactless smartcards,
              such as the ez—link cards. — TODAY/so</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Here's a grand solution. Eradicate ERP..., take apart gantries for scrap metal. Pass a law which requires each and every single fat and overpaid MPs to take a minimum 15% pay cut before the end of 2008. It'll solve a lot more than just gantries. Better roads and more lanes on the expressways. Men-In-White, your days are numbered. Singaporeans can only be pushed so far before they reach their breaking point and then there will be hell to pay... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> And by the way... there is no fullproof system in place with regards to ERP. The only surefire thing is that, it is a gahmen <strong>cash cow</strong>... If it beeps you pay..., if it don't beep you pay more. Hence the <strong>P</strong>ay-<strong>A</strong>nd-<strong>P</strong>ay mandate.... My fellow countrymen, wake up and smell the roses... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p></div>

              <p>They shld insert a new IC-CHIP into ERP, and hide the ERP on top of the driver seat or whatever. And a monthly bill of ERP will be sent to your house each month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Something like Tel phone bills, they should make a option exactly like HP, got "prepaid" the current cash card system. Or they billing system, my friend had set a proposal to them, but i doubt it work, my fren is working in this project at the moment.</p>

              <p>$10 FINE AN 'UNFAIR SLAP'</p>
              <p>Letter from MARIANN MAES</p>
              <p><br>I refer to the report, "CashCard troubles?"<br>While the LTA could continue to argue that its systems are in good order till the cows come home, it is apparent to most drivers that the system really is not as effective as it should be.<br>The $10 fines that we have been paying bear testimony to the daily CashCard problems that drivers encounter at ERP gantries.<br>I had been unfairly slapped with a fine and had appealed to the LTA to waive it, citing my faulty CashCard as the reason.<br>The LTA's response: "You will need more than this excuse to get off the hook."<br>While I understand how troublesome it may be for LTA to verify my claim, it almost sounded as if LTA was really desperate for my $10 note.</p>
