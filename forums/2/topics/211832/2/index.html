            <div class='col-md body'>Why Motor Im... can survive and even thrive in a market full of different brands is due to one sole reason - AH BENGs are everywhere!!!<br><br>My car-less cousin was in the Navy during NS. In his unit there were a number of Hokkien Pengs (uneducated private soldiers) who owned Charades, Impreza, Lancer, Starlet....etc. And these Bengs liked to squat around their lean mean machines with cigarettes in hand and engaging in MOD talk.<br><br>I have seen my cousin arrived for a family dinner in a super loud, souped-up Impreza with stickers more vibrant than the rainbow, spoiler ready to hang/dry bras, and the driver-friend sporting an unmistakable Ah Beng look. When he came to the tables, he was telling everyone that <strong>ONE DAY I WILL OWN THAT SAME CAR</strong>. Everyone laughed out loud and called him an Ah Beng wanabe. He was shocked for he thought it was cool to drive a car that looked like a moving neon-display with Chinese characters to match. He took it very personally and ignored us for a long while.<br><br>Subsequently, when he left the army and graduated from university, he realised what the joke was all about. He realised cars like that are meant for a lesser group of people (usually lowly educated ones) who cannot afford the real thing but try to make up for it by adding bra hangers, neon lights, flashy stickers, Chinese wordings....... He is now a proud owner of an Audi A4 after owning an Altis which was pure stock, no mods.<br><br>Yes, the Impreza is a Beng car!</div>
