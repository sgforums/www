I've seen joggers literally leap off the pavement when a BOV unexpectedly goes off near them. The other possibility is that the stock dump valve spring pressure has weakend over time and the car is no longer on MAF as explained earlier...</div>

Nothing wrong with that in itself, but you should always verify the truth for yourself before posting something. Like you mention "programming an intercooler for 2+ (bar)", do you even know what an intercooler is? How can it be programmed?<br><br>To have productive dialogue, all parties must communicate based on a solid foundation of facts... perhaps it might be useful for you to do some research before posting further.</div>
