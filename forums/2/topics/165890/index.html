            <div class='col-md body'>Having a foglight lamp is not illegal. But having it switch on is illegal in Singapore. There is no grounds to justify why someone will need to on the fog lights when the street light is bright enough for cars not to even on their headlamps.<br>The reasons cited is that having the fog lamps on will distract other road users.</div>

You are talking about those that have 2 smaller lights outer than the headlamps that is located lower to the bottom of the front bumper. That is usually the position of the spot light, but have you notice that when they "on" all the 4 lights (like rectangle position), you will notice the bottom 2 are just as bright as the top 2. So are they really spot lights?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LTA clears the air on proper use of fog lights<br><br>Friday Â• October 14, 2005<br><br>IF drivers found the issue fuzzy before, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is making it very clear now: It's not up to motorists to decide when to turn on their fog lights.<br><br>In fact, since the beginning of this year, enforcement officers from the Registry of Vehicles have given verbal warnings to 120 motorists caught misusing their fog lights, which are the round or square lamps beneath the headlights. Last year, 200 drivers were warned.<br><br>It is an offence for motorists to use their fog lights during clear weather conditions, said LTA, and those caught flouting the rule may be fined or jailed.<br><br>The penalty for a first-time offender is a fine of $1,000 or a jail term of three months. Repeat offenders face double the penalty.<br><br>Fog lights should be used only during adverse weather conditions that result in seriously-reduced visibility - during a heavy downpour or in thick haze for instance. They are not to be turned on during clear weather or night-time driving, said LTA.<br><br>But motorists 938Live spoke to did not seem to be clear on this. Some bought cars that come with built-in fog lights while others installed the lamps on their own.<br><br>Said one driver: "Using the fog lamp is an offence? Luckily, I have never used it! But if it's an offence, why install it in the first place? Â… I personally find fog lights from vehicles behind me very irritating."<br><br>LTA says it will soon launch a public education campaign on the proper use of fog lights.<br></div>

The position between off and full driving lights right? My host father in US told me that it's used for situations where you have to stop on like a highway but you don't want to drain your battery so you leave the parking lights on, they don't suck so much power and this way your car can still be seen by other cars on the highway to prevent high speed accidents.<br><br>The only time I've ever used them in Singapore was when I was following a sedan (I drive an SUV) on a road at night and I noticed my headlights were shining right into his rear view, so I turned it down to parking lamps and turned on my factory fitted fog lamps which are not high enough to cause a nuisance. The driver in front noticed this and gave me a friendly wave  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I do see some cars with only parking lights on and fog lights on sometimes, my neighbor drives a lowered Mitsubishi Galant and he loves doing it.

Can you just imagine, at night, from the opposite lane towards you, a car especially SUVs with big headlights and some more still on Fog lights fitted with either yellowish lights or HID bulbs type, they can actually blind thedriver of normal saloon car from seeing the kerb on the right clearly. With a higher level of foglamps on suv, it causes glares and distract saloon cars driver from seeing clearly the kerb.<br><br>It doesn't matter whether it is legal or illegal. The question is... does the road conditions and visualbility in Singapore requires foglamps? Iwould call those drivers that use foglamps as shoot bird " pak jiao" or inconsiderate idiots who are causing hazards and annoyance to other road user.  Even those that cars fitted with HID xeon head lamps... can't they lower the angle of beams to lower. Always see those stupid RX300 idiots headlight so high can practically blind you from the rear mirror. And worst still.. ralliart was supposed to be fitted with tiltable lights ... 1 idiot can still tilt it to the highest level...<br><br>I would not call foglamp illegal.. but it is those idiots who misuse it, causing road hazards let it ended up to be illegal.

LTA got lotsa funny rules la, no use thinking how they came about.<br><br></div></blockquote>Cant be helped ma. Since it's factory fitted. I dont think LTA will want to start ripping the HIDs off every Odyssey and RX. Maybe that's why they ban aftermarket HIDs.<br><br>But I do agree the RX one is really high up and can really blind the driver in front. Maybe that's the whole idea? Lol.</div>
