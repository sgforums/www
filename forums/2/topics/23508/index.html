Well, you'd be looking at forking out about $600-$700 per month in repayments on top of a $9000 downpayment (20%) calculated based on a 1993-4 Mitsubishi Lancer GLXI 1.3.  The car will cost about $40K depending on condition.<br><br>Once you've taken the plunge (to your bank account as well), you'll have to get insurance.  Your preference of coverage as there are several options...a) 3rd Party Comprehensive - Safest...covers your own car and occupants plus other drivers while driving your car with your permission. b) 1st party - Not so safe but cheapest option...does not cover your own car but covers any other car damaged by yours in an accident.<br><br>If you're below 25 years of age and have never owned a car (i.e. no NCB or no-claim-bonus), you're looking at paying about $1000+ per annum for 3rd party comprehensive. 1st party not recommended for brand new cars but for cars with only a couple years life on Singapore roads left, it's alright.  Not sure how much...can vary depending on insurance company.<br><br>2. Road Tax, you'd be looking at paying about $1000 - $1200 road tax per year if you get a 1.3litre car.  A 1 litre car in my opinion is too pathetic to even consider carrying more than 1 passanger.  You'd probably need to renew your road tax after six months (that's usually the duration the dealer will pay for you) so be prepared to fork out another $400-$500.<br><br>3.

That's gonna amount to $40-$50 for a full tank that'll get you anywhere from 380-450km.<br><br>5. Maintenance - You'd probably be servicing the car regularly (I hope) to keep it in good shape.  It'll cost about $50-$100 per normal service and about $100-$150 for a major service.  That'll come once every 3months or 5000km.

So, needless to say, car with COE left is of cos better.<br><br>As for the mileage thing, think GoonDu had already replied you. On the average, S'porean tends to cover 20,000 km - 25,000 km a year.
