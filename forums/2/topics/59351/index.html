            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, i've spent 3 hours today just on reading all the chats of u ppl on cars' selection and specs. Well, i'm currently on a project and will be planning to get a car by Jun 04. I have a few questions in which i really need advise in.<br><br>1. I'm very interested in getting a S15 coz i enjoyed watching experts drifting on it.. (well, i've tried it out on my employer's Opel Combo 1.7 Dti) quite nice actually but i dun know whether it's consider a drift a not but i really did quite some counter-steering. I've seen regulars like HENG@ and etc commenting on S15 and most have agreed that R34 is a better car. May i know, wat is the biggest diff in these 2 models and wat are they good at?<br><br>2. I was told that Supra is a FR too but i've heard from you guys saying only A.T model avail in sg. Is there's a choice between these 3 cars, which would u guys choose? and why?<br><br>3. Is there any info on the price for P.I and how long do i have to wait till i get my car? Will it be cheaper then to actually buy it from authorised dealers?<br><br>Please Kindly spare me yr precious time in giving me advises.

Mostly, the Skyline, esp the GTR, is the top of the range vehicle from Nissan, while Silva is a more affordable sports coupe.<br><blockquote><strong><br>2.

For Skyline, there are a few models, 25GT-T, 25GT and GTR these ranges are R34s.  25GT=non turbo and rwd, 25gtt=single turbo and rwd, gtr=twin turbo and 4wd.  Although the GTR and 25GT-t have the same power, gtr has more torque than the 25gt that makes it faster.  The 25gt model is a nonturbo, and the power is around 265hp.  But there is no point owning a GTR in sg coz u have no place to run and most probably only can showoff with your car; lastly the price tag would probably turn people off.  But if you really want a skyline, a 25gtt would be reasonable, priced not more than 140k for a second hand.<br>From what i heard from users in the forum, there are only auto supras in sg.  But supra have been discontinued since early 1998, so just consider b4 buying. (skyline r34 discontinued on mid 2002)<br>Heard that a second s15 is not more than 110k, and a skyline 25gtt is not more than 140k.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i see.. Wat i saw most is R34 that u guys are talking about. How about R35 then? Wat i heard is that R35 is much too heavy though there's torque.

It costs $130k<br>from a friend who tuned cars in australia, he says the Silva can be easily coaxed up to 300bhp with a minimal of $5k worth of mods.

If you thus desire to do so many a circuit in Malaysia would do well to serve thy purpose. Or if you so desire to do so in singapore, a deserted carpark devoid of cars would serve such similar purpose. i will, in a private message, pass upon you my ICQ number, for such chat purposes which u desire.</div>
