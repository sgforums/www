            <div class='col-md body'>I used to a an avid cycling enthusiast....have an Owlhollow and Bianchi collecting dust in my garage <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>As a cyclist in my younger days I was one regular face at Bukit Timah up to twice a week, covering 3 laps at least per visit   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> . However on the roads I always went by the rule "Do not Ever Insist on Right of Way, especially against motorised vehicles". I even use predestrian crossings <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  It is your life, limbs, flesh, bones and skin...as such I was always very defensive on the roads...or overly cautious as labelled by my friends. I made it a point to steer clear of vehicles even if it meant evasive manuveurs, e.g bunny-hopping to the pavement to avoid a car that passes closer than what I am comfortable with.<br><br>As a driver I must say some (not all) cyclist have the misconception they are keeping pace with the car or motor bike behind (when in fact they are road-hogging and fustrating the people behind) and some even cycle further from the edge of the road...making it hard for vehicles to pass them without edging out into the next lane. In short, cyclists should be defensive and give as much clearance to a vehicle as possible even if you think u have right of way...never anticipate the driver will yield to you. A sure recipe for tragedy<br><br>I have since gave up cycling as I simply do not feel safe on the roads and my wife thinks it is too risky too....I rather have 230 swedish stallions and 370NM of torque at my disposal on the prod of the accelerator while encassed in one of the safest shell the automotive industry can offer....so much faster not to mention safer.<br><br>I always give cyclists as much room as possible as I was one too and can understand how vulnerable cyclists are.<br><br>Once again it is always better to err on the side of caution and be very flexible on the highway code as many drivers still have the conception cyclists belong on the pavement.<br><br>Take Care</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i always try to give enuf clearance to cyclists on the road cos i know how it feels to be forced off the side by a vehicle.... but some cyclists are clearly endangering their lives when they cycle without any regards for the other road users.... i haf seen cyclists who cycle way out into the middle of the road, expecting the vehicles behind them to switch lanes or to swerve out to the next lane to avoid them, even on a busy road.... many of these r foreign workers, who might be used to this way of cycling on the road back in their home country.....<br><br>just last nite, after i got back to my car in a HDB carpark, i started my engine and on my headlights, check for any oncoming vehicles and started to move off when the coast seems clear.... then suddenly from my left, a cyclist appears in front of my car.... he is practically invisible in the night n i din know where he came from..... if i havent been alerted enuf, i would haf knocked into him..... thank god i didnt..... but if i had did.... whose fault would it be then?<br><br>i guess no matter wat, everybody should practise safe driving n cycling n riding n not expecting the other drivers to give way no matter wat....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buses and big vehicles (like lorries) always put other road users through a test of "WHO IS STRONGER??". How many times have we seen on the roads that big vehicles sway into other lanes without looking??<br><br>5 years ago, I was driving on CTE in the 2nd left lane. I was behind this lorry that intend to turn left. After the lorry went into the turning lane, the driver changed his mind and suddenly decided to come back into my lane, WITHOUT looking or signalling. I honked the driver but he ignored me. I have to performed an emergency stopped and hit the railings. The lorry driver did not bother to stop but quickly drove away to avoid a confrontation. Had I not been alert on the road, I almost died that evening.<br><br>Like the lorry driver, this 30yrs old - hot blood - bus driver must be thinking that his bus is bigger in size and must show his "colors" to this bunch of cyclists that got in his way. If the driver has such attitude, he will not give ways to cars or motorcyclists as well.<br><br>Doesn't he, as a bus driver, knows that on a road with single white line, he is not ALLOWED to overtake??  Is this driver telling us that the bus drivers study the rules just to pass and get the job??<br><br>This is manslaughter and YES, this driver ought to be HANGED!!!<br></div>

Mr Ang, 37, was pinned under the front wheel of a bus, after a collision while cycling along Lim Chu Kang Road on Dec 19.<br><br>On Christmas Eve, the store designer succumbed to his multiple injuries and died.<br><br>Early yesterday morning, his friends gathered more than 100 cyclists, including MP Ong Kian Min, to raise awareness of an issue that was high on the dead man's mind - getting drivers to recognise and respect cyclists as fellow road users.<br><br>Mr Ang's widow, who did not wish to be interviewed, flagged off the group from the Peirce Reservoir carpark for yesterday's 60km ride<br><br>The cyclists observed a minute's silence before setting off 7.30am, in memory of the man described as an excellent husband, a sports enthusiast and a good friend.<br><br>Most of them wore red, Mr Ang's favourite colour, as they pedalled their way to Mandai, Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Timah and back to the Peirce Reservoir carpark.<br><br>One of the organisers, Mr Adrian Mok, 29, said: 'People feel connected to Sylvester's accident. We've all experienced something nasty while out riding, but Sylvester's death was a blow to us.'<br><br>The group from the Triathlon Family, which comes together to train for triathlons and which Mr Ang was a part of, said yesterday's event was also to remind cyclists to ride carefully.<br><br>The police said comment on the accident is inappropriate as investigations are continuing.<br><br>However, aerobics instructor Noor Azmah knows the perils of cycling on the roads all too well.<br><br>The 30-something turned up for the ride, even though she didn't know Mr Ang, to 'support the cause'.<br><br>Just two weeks ago, Miss Noor, who cycles everywhere she goes, was in a collision with a car and hurt her leg. Two years ago, she suffered head injuries in another road accident.<br><br>Freelance writer Alan Francis, 47, attested to the callous behaviour of many motorists.<br><br>He, too, has been involved in several accidents and a lot of near-misses.<br><br>The avid cyclist said: 'Too many motorists think that cyclists have no right to be on the road.<br><br>'At times, motorists pretend that you are not there or try to scare you off by coming really close to your bike.'<br><br>Mr Ong, a Member of Parliament for Tampines GRC and chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, also showed up to give the riders a boost.<br><br>He said his GPC would work with the authorities to improve road safety and safety awareness for cyclists.</div>

The pace differs in the packs faster cyclist caught up with slower ones thus forming a bigger pack. Cycling in single file in smaller pack is easy but in bigger pack problems do occur.<br><br>A pack of 20-30 cyclist cycling in single file will drive the road motorist crazy. This is more dangerous because cyclist stretches out along the road in single file will cause unnecessary obstruction at filtering &amp; turning lanes. This will result in drivers trying to cut in between cyclist or even cut in ahead of cyclist abruptly (juz imagine the cyclist falling off the bicycle like humdee dumdee with both leg clip on the paddels)<br><br>If these cyclist cycle in pack &amp; occupying a lane but in shorter distance span. Cars are still able to slow down for lane changing &amp; turning off lanes. This is better, safer  &amp; more visible than cutting off abruptly or have to come to a halt waiting for the single file cyclist to clear off.<br><br>I'm not sure how drivers think of this?<br>Is it better &amp; safer for cyclist to be more visible cycling in pack or single file along road. (As i can often hear motorist arguing that they cant see the cyclist during the incidents, even with our blinks &amp; lights)<br><br>Mushigen, What u think??<br>Do u think it will be safer for the cyclists (30-40) to cycle in single file at a time &amp; blocking the turns..... waiting to get horned &amp; knock down by motorist. hmmm, I dont u will have the chance to turn out or in the left lane with 30-40 cyclist in single file(long snake moving down the road..haha) only after few mins of wait.</div>
