            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>Just wondering what you guys think about city and altis.<br><br>I know it might be an unfair comparison, but looking at the prices of these two,<br>they are pretty similar.<br><br>I'm looking at the Vtec version of city that comes with SRS and ABS. That's why the price is comparable to an altis.<br><br>I know that city has also brake discs on both front and rear.. but altis?<br><br>like to know about the cabin noise while travelling too.<br><br>and also FC.<br><br>thinking about the city because it claims to have better FC.<br><br>In addition, it is a 1.5CC car, which, correct me if i'm wrong, road tax should be cheaper.<br><br>but then again, if paying for that kind of price, might as well get a 1.6 altis...<br><br>dunno, pretty confused. hope you guys can help.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Go and test drive both cars. Altis looks much bigger on the exterior but the styling is conservative.<br>City scores on interior space and clever packaging (large boot, ultra seat) and comes with CVT but styling invites many opinions. Either you like it or you hate it, especially the rear section. Search the internet for review and comments. Also check out the mod City, with full bodykit.<br>Altis is family orientated whilst City is for the younger set.<br>Try out the Colt or Megane lah...not bad also. Reanult 407 is a stunner!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i'm driving a city vtec now..<br>IT accutually depends on what kind of car you want. Powerful or Big and spacious.<br><br>Spaciousness---city* like what the other guy said clever planning for the interior.<br><br>Look--- Altis* most ppl will take altis cuz its a toyota and it looks better than the city<br><br>Performance--- stabability--- altis wider and longer.<br>--- Power--- city* although 110hp, but Electric power steering<br>saves power imput from the engine and uses the battery instead. Giving the car more power..<br><br>---transmission--- city--- cvt+7 speed mode. that means that u have tip-tronic way of changing gears on the steering wheel. *for the city my experience is that when u switch to S mode and drive, the car blows dust on most cars until the 2.0 litre range without turbocharging your engine.<br><br>Steering---depends... * city's electric power steering makes steering very easy, but loses when high speed stabability.<br>--- altis Ok all round.<br><br>Braking---- City * guess its bcoz of the 4 brake discs.<br><br>Tyres ---- the tyres given on both cars are not fansastic, rather you change them to bridgestone s 03, gIII or yokohama avs sport (i think)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a Altis 1.6 driver...<br><br>Spaciousness: boot is alrite... back seats are very spacious... easily take 3 big guys, front is very spacious too...<br><br>Looks: I feel that it looks better than the city, all u need is a bigger set of wheels to make it look a lot better...<br><br>Performance: Handling could be better, and could be improved a lot with some after market stuff of a few hundred bucks... FC: most altis get bout near 13km/l, I get near 13km/l even with 16" rims... pretty good for a 1.6 if u compare it with the rivals.<br><br>Maintenance: Enuff said bout Toyota reliability....<br><br>Transmission:4 speed auto ECT, ok lah quite smooth if u r not a perfectionist<br><br>Braking: actually Altis also got 4 discs: front ventilated and rear solid discs<br><br>Rims and Tyres: if u wan better performance, use ur own money to improve on them.<br><br>Think most pple go for altis cos of we think it has better resale value, good FC against other 1.6 rivals, reliability<br>Now for less than $80K, u get the 1.8 Altis, i personally think it's a good deal...and the altis OMV should be higher than city, though the difference is minimal spread over 10 years...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand about the look of city... i used to hate it... but after looking at it for a while... not bad....<br>test driven it and found that it is quite responsive.... but cannot push it to the limit as it is just a test drive. Considering it because of its fuel efficiency... heard that the new jazz can clock up to 24km per litre with it's new idsi engine.... wow....<br><br>as for altis.... test driven it too... but not much of an impression...  i also felt that the interior of the altis is bigger than the city... dunno... mixed review.. some said that FC is not very good... while some said it is very good... some just said that depend on which batch of cars you collect....<br><br>tested the megane.. a lot of nice features... but price also a bit high....  pick up slow... but very quiet.....<br><br>as for 407... phew.... way out of my class....<br><br>basically i'm looking car that save fuel, has a backside to put things, don't costs a bomb.... and safe....<br><br>Thanks</div>
