Meaning actually pay might be 2.5k. But the rest of the figures seems reasonable. So maybe you can be like me, save up for 2-3 years. Down using half of the savings, half for rainy days and whatever you have not claculate for your car.<br><br>Of course, that means you can't travel, can't drink, can't kara-ok, can't shop like cazy, can't ......

But as a matter of public service I'm going to state this.<br><br>You plan to retire at some point in your life, no?<br><br>Say you are 20 now... you plan to retire at 60 and live another 20 years till you are 80.<br><br>That's 40 years of work (provided you have a consistent pay cheque.  ie. you never lose your job throughout your working life) in which you have to save enough to last 20 years during retirement.<br><br>Given inflation, housing rental each month (if you plan to buy your own place at 2K a month while owning a car...  good luck to you), food, etc...   You'll need 2K a month at least!!!  Although with current inflation more likely 2.5K a month.<br><br>So 2k x 20(years) x 12(months) = $480,000 (notice I didn't even talk about falling ill, hospitalisation, etc.)<br><br>So now you need to save $1K a month for retirement [480,000 / (40x12)]<br><br>Based on a take home of 1.8K a month - you spend 1k on a car (monthly + road tax + insurance + parking + petrol + servicing + occasional repairs).<br><br>That leaves you $800 a month...  not even enough for retirement fund, don't even talk about rainy day savings or money left for your day to day food and clothes, etc...<br><br>You REALLY want a car that badly?<br><br>Savings for marriage?  Kids clothes, food, schooling etc?  If you expect your kids to look after you.. think of this.   So hard to make ends meet now, you think your kids will have it easier in future?  You think they can look after you too?<br><br>Do NOT depend on CPF... that is not enough...  Think of it as further insurance incase you live longer than 20 years after retirement... as well as some misc medical cost (which you will need when you get older).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agreed with you. Worry too much and you will miss out what you want after you die. Life is short, just enjoy what you want, don't think too much but of cos to what you can afford la. Sometime too many planning is no good.<br><br>If we plan until nice nice like after 60 years old, you will have 500k...etc, do you think you will have the chance to enjoy, to use it? Who noes, may be u die early n u wasted ur time to save and it is not justify to save and never use, kind of wasting effort to save. After all, don't think we will live longer, cos we are eating too many good food and there are too many wireless thingy around us (handphone and wireless access point, too many radiation)<br><br>So just go ahead with your dream of owning a car if you can afford but u must calculate nicely so that you won't end up owning a car and you can't even go out.<br><br>Guess must set aside of 1k for car, $ 500 for ur monthly usag, the rest for saving or insurance or give parents....etc<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by endless373:</div><div class="quote_body">Worry too much will get u nowhere...<br><br>Do your own sum and you shld noe how much u can afford to fork out each mth.<br><br>your pay of monthly $2500 should be sufficient to own a small car.<br><br>Years ago, I got my first car also with pay of abt $2500. I have no other commitment, stay with parent, no wife, no kid... No, i dun need to eat bread etc... Life is as per normal... and Yes i have little saving at that time but as years passes by, your pay increases and that when your saving starts to build up.<br><br>Life is already so stressful in sg... dun need to worry so much... do your own sum and if you feel that u can afford, just go get it... </div></blockquote></div>
