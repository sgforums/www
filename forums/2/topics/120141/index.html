Once you gotten a car, you will have to cut back on a lot of your expense. Not impossible, just a bit hard at first. Worse if you are taking 10 years loan.<br><br>For a period of 10 years, better get a reliable "No Doubt" car that you will not grow out of, or not least you break even for the loan you are taking. Do a search on this forum, you might find a thread talking about Matrix selling off just after 1 year of ownership. That is a good lesson we can all learn. He took 10 years loan, have to top-up about 20k just to sell the car off. Do have a look slowly, no rush. Widen your choices so you can choose and compare.<br><br>Car is a sure-lose investment that you have to hold on to to minimise loses. Remember that. Not advisable if you are not finacially stable.</div>

Always thought that you save up of the car price, then use it on the maintences. Buying second-hand car when buying your first car doesn't seems advise-able. 1 important factor is you might not know any mechanics that could help you check out the car. Also very hard to calculate the maintenece cost involved in it.</div>

That's a real fun car to drive, but needed to get a 4 seater, 4 door for family.   So I had the option of selling the DelSol and buying another 4 door, "safe" car for the family, but with enough power for myself ($$$)...  or keep the DelSol and buy a cheaper second car.<br><br>I decided on option 2 and ended up with the Rio Hatchback.  Can't compare the DelSol and the Rio (apples and oranges), but it's fun enough to drive (IT IS!!!) that I don't feel like a lame turtle when I'm in it instead of the DelSol.<br><br>So, in the end... it's really up to you.  Test drive till you're satisfied.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
