I have been driving Altis since 8th Jan 04, so far so good. The bad pt so far is the HU is ugly and sound quality isn't great. The 14-inch rim is a bit small for Altis body. Other than that, the ride is good.<br>Test-drive the Altis yourself to feel/see whether this car is up to your expectations. At the end of the day, you are the one driving.</div>

Also grappled with some of the same issues when deciding. Here is why I bought eventually.<br><br>main critique - made in Thailand .... implication being a inferior quality, likely to break down, fall apart, not as quiet etc.<br><br>My reasoning : Merc is made / assembled in S.Africa, your Volvo is assembled in India, the BMW are also done in S.Africa. Lexus produes its cars in US now. Toyota produces Corolla in every continent now, Australia, Asia, US, Europe and Africa. No one has complianed that local produced Corollas are inferior. In fact, the Thailand plant is supposed to be the toyota plant with least defects per car internationally.<br><br>Conclusion ?? : Look at the car for yourself. A toyota fan would say that the altis is the best. A honda fan would say that the altis is outdated. Look, drive and decide for yourself if you like the looks, handling and the interior.<br><br>I decided after looking and test driving twice. The quality is definitely there. The most impt parts of the car, the transmission, the engine and body are Japanese built. Who cares it is assembled in thailand, except that the same quality is evident.<br><br>On the contrary, I decided against, e.g. lancer cos the quality was very different ... try other cars like suzuki, kia etc to see ... simple things like sound of door closing ... or the feeling when you sit inside  ....<br><br>It is your $70,000 or $80,000. Whatevery you buy, u must make sure you are happy with your decision.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all....<br><br>Mmm ... I am not a car owner currently but hope to get one soon. Not 1.6litres but a 1.3 prefer ... looking at Getz currently.<br><br>I drove my brother Lancer 1.6. When ... overall driving experience is not bad. Good Point are.<br><br>1. Styling is sportier and nicer with sport rims as compare to other similar range 1.6<br><br>2. Price is cheaper than Toyota and Honda (Elegance model - with Leather seats, upholstery, sport rim and fog lamp)<br><br>3. Transmission is smooth with CVT<br><br>4. Leg room are good for tall pple<br><br>5. I think the back is nicer as compare to Altris, Corolla and Civic.<br><br>Bad Point.<br>1. Engine are noisy especially when driving 90km/h and above<br><br>2. Audio Unit are lousy especially when listen to radio (poor reception)<br><br>3. Engine is old but improved version of old, trusty GLX<br><br>4. Pickup is so-so only<br><br>For me, to buy a car since its purpose is to ferry pple. The most important factor in order are as follows:<br><br>1.   PRICE<br><br>2.   Maintenance cost<br><br>3.   Fuel Consumption<br><br>Cos I am riding a bike now, I prefer to get the above points to ease my pocket.<br><br>For pple who prefer accel, styling and speed. I think should not be looking at 1.6 cos 1.6 litre saloon cars are not known to be accel 0-100km/h under 10 sec except for the Turbo version of Ignis and YRV.<br><br>If comfort, accel, speed and look are what u looking for. 2.0litre sporty car like Galant, Audi A4 or continental cars are what you should be looking at.<br><br>My 2 cent worth.</div>
