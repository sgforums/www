            <div class='col-md body'>What is the rationale behind the levy of 6 times of normal road tax if the private vehicle is diesel-powered.<br><br>As far as i konw, diesel powered car used to be more polluting than petrol ones. Thus government imposed this tax to discourage people using diesel cars.<br><br>BUt nowadays and in time to come, diesel powered vehicles are cleaner. In a years time, diesel cars must comply with a new standard that is very strict. the new standard has proved it emits HALF of the CO2 petrol cars does.<br><br>Also, diesel cars have nearly double the fuel efficiency of a petrol.<br><br>So isn't time Govt should do away with this tax? or they got other reasons?<br><br>hmmm... please avoid comments like "govt love money what".<br><br>because europe have diesel version of Subaru Forester and legacy already.<br><br>and like in recent news, SAF considering diesel powered BMW m5,  rexton, etc as the Rover Defender replacements.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is to discourage the ownership of diesel vehicles on our road....<br>The initial diesel engine is relatively loud and emits alot of harmful gases.<br>Another point is at their existance are primary as goods vehicles in Singapore...

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks.<br><br>But what i meant is......  "modern" diesel engines now emits less polution and noise than petrol counterparts.....<br><br>why should singapore still discourage private ownership of diesel cars?<br><br>isn't it time sgp govt should do something about this??<br><br>especially now that petrol price is increasing on a monthly basis.<br><br>at least diesel gives more mileage per litre.</div>

Half of europe private cars are diesel powered and they are encouraging it as it is more economical AND environmental friendlier now.<br><br>Moreover, they are coming out with what EURO 4 emission standard. Singapore is making the local buses/commercial vehicles comply with this standard.<br><br>With this new standard, vehicles produce half the CO2 petrol cars emit.<br><br>2.

Diesel engines can now be made much quieter.....<br><br>in fact  the VW TDIs are so quiet one have to be really close to tell it is running on diesel.<br><br>4. Pollutants emitting from diesel are caused by poorly maintain vehicles/engine.....<br><br>one major culprit, SHIPS registered in Panama, etc but plying singapore routes.<br><br>second major culprit, i guess the SAF rovers?? haha.<br><br>poorly maintained vehicles but somehow managed to get away with VICOM.<br><br>A full tank of diesel bora TDI travels about 1000km compared to Petrol Bora about 300km.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... If the rules are relaxed by the government to allow diesel powered passenger cars in Singapore, I think there will be a gradual increase in the number of people flocking to buy diesel powered cars because of lower fuel costs. If this happens, the rate for diesel in Singapore will most likely to go up too. Just my point of view.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
