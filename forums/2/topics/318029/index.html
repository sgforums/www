              <p>hi forum,</p>
              <p>need you to share some advice and experience.</p>
              <p>i have not tint the windows before.</p>
              <p>many do that.</p>
              <p>I like to seek your comments:</p>
              <p>1. with the best tinting, putting your car under direct sunlight of high noon, on a hot afternoon, under no shelther, for say 2 - 3 hours straight, without turning on the air-con on, with the windows all closed tight, without any other sun block tools, just plain tinted windows, will the car be unbearably hot also when one enters it and close the door after this period of time?</p>
              <p>To me, my understanding is a car is a greehouse. As simple as that.even with tinting, this car will still be very hot and warm after 3 hours . If not after 4 hours. It accumulates heat fast and even little heat allowed in will easily snowballs into a unbearable heat.</p>
              <p>2. For a normal driver, with tinted rear and rear side windows completely black visible from exterior, on a night, driving on the roads, will this tinting in any atom of a way hinder the vision of the driver? I was told visible as opague black from exterior, such windows will appear less dark from the interior. I can accept this but still i like to know, is there any risk introduced ? If there is slight risk introduced, please let me know. If there is completely no risk, please advise also and explain why.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, could you please give me your 2 cents.</p>
              <p>thankyou muchie</p>
              <p>  </p>

              <p>hmm. actually even if u tint ur windows or windscreen. ur car will still be hot under direct sunlight when u leave it there for 2-3hrs. like hw science explains it. no matter what, black is still a gd absorber of heat. it's onli when u driving, e sunlight which passes into e car wun be so bright which will hurt ur eyes.</p>
              <p>secondly, when u tint ur window or windscreen, there will of cuz be slight visibility changes to ur vision. it will be darker at night. but as time passes, u shld adapt to e change pretty quick. n i think e current law onli allow 20 or 30% blocking of sunlight in e front windscreen n 2 window, den e back windows 70%.</p>
              <p>anyway, i will still support tinted windows n windscreen</p>

              <p> tinting only reduces the speed of heat buildup inside the car, by restricting the amount of UV and radiant heat through the windows. No matter what, if you leave you car under the sun for an hour or 2, the cabin temperature witll soar.... just simply leave the doors open upon entry or wind down the windows as you drive off for a few minutes to let the hot air escape.</p>
              <p>Personally I feel that the current tinting laws is sufficent to allow enough visability at night. It's just like driving a van <img title="Very Happy" src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"> but at least you still have less blindspots</p>

              <p>dear frens,</p>
              <p>thanks for the kind replys.</p>
              <p>can i say the front windscreen must never be tinted?</p>
              <p>why is it that side ones can be and not the front one? not even slightly?</p>
              <p>given the same explanations of adaptation with time and only 20-30% sunlight block, why is it that side windows and rear window can be blocked almost completely black and not the front one?</p>
              <p>To me, I think rear windscreen if blocked 100% is a real risk to both passengers, driver and road users.</p>
              <p>so, why the different policies?</p>

              <p>quote from one.motoring:</p>
              <p><em>a) They must not be of the reflective type.<br>b) The resultant light transmittance for the front windscreen and two front side windows must be at least 70%.<br>c) The resultant light transmittance for the rear windscreen and the rear passenger windows must be at least 25%.<br>d) The front windscreen must not prevent, obstruct or interfere with the transmission of signals between the In-vehicle Unit (IU) and Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) facility.<br></em><br>You can tint the front windscreen, but only with very light tint. The front windscreen and front side windows are the within the driver's field vision... so to maintain some flexibility, they let you tint to certain extend while still achieve optimum visibitity.</p>
              <p>I wanna comment on your view on the blocked rear windscreen...  I personally drive a minivan and though I hardly have anything behind to hinder my view through the rear mirror, most of the time I depend on the side mirrors and of course, exercise precautions, like signaling side indicators prior to shifting lanes or turning. Can't always depend on the law to ensure safety right? As a driver, you have to put on some responsibility to to ensure safety not only to yourself, but to other roads users too.</p>
              <p>I think your perception on "blocked almost completely black" is just based from the view from the outside right? You may not able to see inside, but from the inside looking out, it isn't as dark as you'd thought it'll be. As long as the interior environment is darker than the condition outside... there shouldn't be a problem... unless you decor your interior with flashing christmas disco lights, dices or whatever.<img title="Very Happy" src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"></p>

              <p>Thank you frens! :)</p>
              <p>Its good that its confirmed that:</p>
              <p>1. front screen can be tinted to a minimal extent with practical reasons for being so.</p>
              <p>2. Generally people can adapt to the dark tinting of the rear and rear side windows as long as interior is darker than exterior.</p>
              <p>3. Risk may be there , though minimal , when you tint the rear and rear side windows. Exception is when one exercise good safety habits and take precautions. I think the bottomline is still that tinting introduce some risks to drivers especially new drivers or old folk drivers with weaker visibility.</p>
              <p>4. no matter how you legally tint a car, any car, it will still accumulate heat that you feel unbearable when you first enter it after parking under hot sun for at least 2-3 hours straight.</p>
              <p>cheers!</p>
