            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah not to be disrespectful but that road leading in and out of seletar dam  is not level so to speak and not to mention the numerous heavy vehicles parked along the side of the road during the night. Even for a car going at say 80 going into(or coming out) of one of the "dips" of the road could redirect the car. Looking at the pic I can only say its a pity. The MR-S group of ppl frequent the dam and other spots in the north regularly. Some of them has pretty prominent licence plate numbers ( hint" the "6" and "8" combinations)  on their MR-S and MR2.  Now, another one bites the dust, one is dead and the pax...laid up in hospital...pity</div>
