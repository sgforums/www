            <div class='col-md body'>hi, I do rent cars before and by far has not encountered much problems.<br>My rental policy is to make sure I get a well-maintained car, not some COE car for 40-50 bucks. Physically it should look sturdy. When collecting the car I'll drive around nearby to ensure no problem, also drive to petrol kiosk to check the oil &amp; tyre. Should adopt such practice.<br><br>Below are some the people/companies i've rented b4. Do note I don't have any affliation with any of them:<br><br>North: Raj @ 93855270. I like his 3dr Rav4. $65/weekday, $75/weekend.<br>Central: Serangoon Shopping Centre, 92765934. Rental company, can get a cheap nissan march at about $50.<br>West/East: Falconair. Can get a pretty new (&lt;5yr old) proton wira at $50+ also.<br>East: Yonghow @ 91919922. I hope this guy is not the Henry mentioned. But my 1 time experience with him left me impressed. He'll go the extra mile to arrange the pick up/collection at your convenience.<br><br></div>
