            <div class='col-md body'>owning a car here if you don't use it often is like carrot by the garmen. Somemore the cars made in thailand like some toyotas and honda and jack up the price to ridiculous price. even people say cheap now but overseas with that price, can get a even better car. anyway alot of SG people moving out of SG nowdays so am i. Cars in SG is you pay for the high price but you get inferior quality.</div>
