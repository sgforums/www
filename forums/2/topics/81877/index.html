            <div class='col-md body'>Presently driving the City 1.5L iDSI CVT. It is the top spec version with dual airbags, ABS with EB and cost me $69,500/-. It has so far clocked 8600km and due for the 10,000 km servicing next month or so.<br><br>Fuel consumption so far is about 550 to 600 km on full tank of 42 litres, with mixture of urban/highway driving. So far the car has been giving me sheer driving pleasure. In a way, I call this car a 'transformer' . Why? Because when you are engaged in the auto 'D' mode, you are a goody 2 shoe but when you engaged the 'S' mode and activate the steermatic 7 speed manual over ride, you are a wannebe street racer. Yes! The City just simply underwent a radical transformation. You can feel the max power coming on at an instance and propel the car so fast you have to tap on the brake to avoid hitting the car infront. No, this is not an exaggeration. Just try it!<br><br>City recently introduces the Vtec version. I have test drive it but find the Vtec power coming on only aroud 5000 rpm, whilst the iDSI full torque comes on at 2700 rpm. Vtec is only useful if you go for manual. The iDSI makes the best of both world, auto and steermatic.<br><br>Some has say the City rear end is odd looking and it concerns me initially but after previewing the internet review and opinion, just adding on a rear spolier will silence the critics. There is also after market OEM Mugen bodykit avaliable in Malaysia for RM1300/-. They look awesome!<br><br>What about the Vios? well, my colleagues drives the Vios but after they have seen the City and test drive it, they were cursing themselve for their choice. Need I say more? All said, don't follow the crowd, try it out yourself both City and Vios. But be warned about the SE at Toyota Ubi. Dress rich and you will be served and yes, if you hold your cheque book in your hand or flash your gold card once in a while.<br><br>Cheers![/img]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree the City's rear is a topic of discussion but then again, to each his own liking rite? I personally do not find it an eye sore, i.e. if you add on the rear spolier and body kit.<br><br>For the Mugen look alike bodykit, just ask around any access shops in JB. Ask for the PU quality type. Anything more than RM 1500 is expensive. Oh yes, if they offer to do spray paint, don't take it as their quality if not up to par with that of Singapore. That's my experience with the rear spoiler.<br><br>Any City owner would notice that the left sun visor lacks a vanity mirror rite? Well, you can get it from Honda Malaysia for S$45/-. For the beige color car mat, you can get the bigger version with snap on button also. The ones supply by Kah Motor are really midget size and I have it replaced immediately.<br><br>For the Vios, no pun intended but don't they all look alike from far, i.e. the Altis and Vios. You can't tell them apart until near when you notice the smaller width of the Vios. There goes for creative design by Toyota. They always tend to be conservative and like to stick to the same tested concept again and again.</div>
