Being denied a test-drive based on your image is ridiculous - I know personally a few wealthy individuals whom, judging by their first-hand appearence, do not look like the sterotypical millionaire.

Here more than 90% of Porsches on the road, regardless of a base model Boxster or a top of the line 996 Turbo are equipped with a tipronic 5-speed Automatic, killing much of the appeal of the vehicles to true enthusiasts, but apparently not to the more image conscious.<br><br>Even the performance-oriented 996 GT3 MK1 and MK2 sold here have been specified with sunroofs (slightly ironic when considering that they are equipped with weight saving measures such as carbon composite seats and stripped out sound deadening!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ).<br><br>It really is a shame, as it doesnt matter whether your paying 65'000$ to buy a Suzuki Ignis Sport or 540'000$ to buy a Porsche GT2, you really would want to get a subjective feel behind the wheel of a car before you go on to commit to a purchase. Being denied a test-drive based on your image is ridiculous - I know personally a few wealthy individuals whom, judging by their first-hand appearence, do not look like the sterotypical millionaire. If I was refused a test drive in any cirumstance based on this joke known as local customer service (or more clearly, distinct lack of it in Singapore) I would walk away without hesitation. There are many high-end vehicles available on the market, but apparently true customer service is at a even higher premium here...</div></blockquote>agreed. apparently, local marketing trends for these exotic machines seem to indicate that the majority of the well heeled would rather spend their time looking good in and feeling comfortable in their automatic supercars.</div>
