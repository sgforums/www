In all other estates in Singapore, we usually come across one continues concrete divider or island divider, or those red/orange flexible rubber flaps that bend if you run over it.<br><br>These solid blocks of conrete markers/divider are curb-height, look like little pyramids, and can cause some serious damage to the under-carriage of your vehicle, knock your steering off-balance, or possibly break your steering arm or puncture your oil sump!<br><br>I slammed into one at around 15Km/h, and the impact threw my steering off-balance.  These stupid things were painted yellow, not the usual red or orange warning colors. Besides color-code, it's not safe to use solid concrete for these markers!!<br><br>You people who visit this estate, watch out for these markers cum dividers, or you can potentially end up with costly repairs to your vehicle!
