              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Don’t EVER lose your parking Ticket while at City Square JB as you are treated as a criminal….</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">We have a very nasty experience at City Square on 19 July 2008. Just wish to share with you guys of what we have experience. Just remember don’t EVER EVER lose your parking ticket when you park there! </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is our first time parking at JB City Square. After our meals and shopping, while trying to make payment for the parking, we realized that we have lost out parking ticket. A fine is inevitable and we accept this as this is our penalty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">We went to the car park management office in B1, beside Secret Recipe to pay the RM 25 fine. To our surprise, they demand a photocopy of our passport which of course we refused. Why should they make a photo copy of our passport over a lost ticket? Is this some sort of a criminal crime? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">I questioned them why a photocopy of the passport and they give me different reasons after asking them for the reason several time. Reasons being management required them to do so; police required them to do so; it’s the standard procedure! </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Of course we refused to give because we don’t feel safe giving them our passport over a lost parking ticket. Moreover, we think that they don’t have a right to get a photocopy of our passport; neither do we think this is necessary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">So we demand to speak to management but they refused to let us do so, citing that it’s a police procedure! So I challenged them to ask the police down to tell me if this is really a required procedure by the police. They just kept quiet and ignore us. And the car park supervisor said to us rudely that they won’t release us out of the car park if we refuse to provide our passport.<span>  </span>Given no choice and after some argument, we are forced to relent. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The next most absurd thing is that after we fill up the form give them our passport to photocopy, they sent a guard to follow us all the way to our car. We were wondering why, we thought that he is going to escort us out. To our amazing shock, he is actually armed with a digital camera to TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH of our car plate! By then I really lost my cool and start shouting at him that WE HAVE ALREADY given out passport photocopy why does he still want to take a photo of our car plate. Of course I refuse to let him take. Stupid reasons follows: they are just following management procedure and they can’t let us go without a photograph taken. And the photograph is taken to prove that the car plate number written on the form is actually the same as the car that we are driving! After 10 minutes of reiteration, we gave up as we only have 15 minute grace time to exit the car park.<span>  </span>And by then all we want is to leave this horrible place. We will never return to this horrible place again. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Till now we still don’t understand what their rationales behind their actions are. Till now we are still wondering do they have a right to take a photocopy of our passport? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">I am posting this to warn you guys if you don’t wish to gone through what we have gone through, PLEASE be careful with your parking ticket!</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You should not have relented by letting them make a photocopy of your passport. You may be in deep shit later on, as the details may be abused.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should actually call the police on the spot. If not, park your car at the exit and hold up the traffic there. They may just let you pass then.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me tell you a similar incident. My colleague drove into Suntec city and could not find a parking lot. He then drove out but had to pay for parking charges as he had been inside for more than 10mins. He refused to pay because he had not parked his car at all. He had an arguement with the carpark management. He then parked his car at the exit, holding up the vehicles leaving the carpark. In the end, the carpark management had no choice but to let him leave without paying up.</p>

              <p>Ya I have never drive in to JB to enjoy the cheap petrol, cheap food, cheap shopping etc. Not because I am rich bt because I do not want to risk things happening to myself and my car. If I wanted to eat cheap seafood once in a while, I will just take a taxi in with my frens.</p>
              <p>Its really funny to hear my car club frens or their frens who complain what kind of things they encounter in JB or Malaysis but yet still continue to drive into it. There was this encounter recently I find it so funny being posted in the CTR forum. THis guy wanted to drive to Genting. Along the way, he kena robbed in a petrol station. Anyone in the right mind would have waited for the police or even if wan to drive off would have drive and come back to Singapore. But guess what, that guy says he continue to drive up to Genting. WHAT SIA! Kena robbed still got mood to go Genting!</p>

              <p><a href="../../../users/242933">Anticitysquare</a>, from my point of view, what the management do is right. They have to make sure the correct owner of the car can drive away to prevent any car stollen case.</p>
              <p>Let's say i go to management and pay the fine, got the exit ticket, then i can just broke any car and drive out. The security follow u to the car make the same purpose, to make sure the thieft did not smash the wind screen and drive away any car cause already have exit coupon. That's why they advice you to keep the parking coupon with you, to prevent somebody smach your windscreen, go to pay the parking fees or report lost and then can drive away.</p>
              <p>What will happen if after you shopping and found your car is stollen? U will sure scold the management without the proper check can easily issue a exit ticket. As we all know the car stollen case in JB is very high, the more strighten rules is needed.</p>

              <p>Erm what's wrong with them requiring you to let them see your passport when your parking ticket is lost? You only have yourself to blame for losing the ticket, and once they notice that you are a foreigner, confirm they would want to know your identity what. Otherwise what if you happen to have found the key to the car, drove it out and it happens that the car belongs to another person?</p>
              <p>They are taking the necessary precaution. You should be glad they are doing it instead of complaining over here. If you do not want the same trouble to crop up, then take good care of your ticket and don't blame the rigorous procedures you need to go through if you happen to lose it!</p>

              <p>I support what <a href="mailto:user@user">user@user</a> and rainee said.</p>
              <p>The car park assistants is right, what if "Somebody A" is not the real owner to the car that "Somebody A" who paid the fine?</p>
              <p>Anticitysquare, considered youself lucky. What if somebody have found the lost parking ticket and so coincidently smashes your car window and drive it away with car theft technique?</p>
              <p>Me never go to JB ever since their Mgovt ppl wanted to implement the $20 entry fee, which they can't decide to collect it or not even after more than a year now. Haha... think they quite worried JB economy will drop deadly if we Singaporean never visit them again.</p>
              <p>Even they begging now, I'll never go JB again. Why go? Want to kena rob, sodomy, rape or kill is it?</p>
              <p>Now even Cppl there don't feel safe living in JB anymore and started moving out from there. If the trend continue, then sooner or later JB will be another Kelantan liao.</p>
              <p>You know, it is very frustrate situation. They wanted us to bring them money but then they keep showing us how big their C is when we really travel over there. What this man?</p>
              <p>I've know this type of Malaysia ppl. They have this stupid feeling to think that Singaporean we must be always thinking that we are superior than the Malaysian (as we are richer and achieved better overall) even we never said that. So in order the make that stupid feeling away, they try hard to force us to see their ugly C so they could feel balance in their stupid brain. To put it simple, this type of mppl always feeling inferior when they met us.</p>

              <p>The whole incident to me is a communication break down. all both party are not showing a good face to each other that causes the arguement.</p>
              <p>I did lose my ticket last year in the same carpark! I was requested to do the same things as what TS mentioned. maybe I was lucky that time I was explain by a malaysian driver that even malaysian have to do the same if they lose their ticket.</p>

              <p>ACS, there is a very simple reason why they/you went thru' the trouble, and they probably experienced it before already.</p>
              <p>say a car thief managed to break into the car and starts it (without much of a fuss), the only way that they can drive out your car is to declare the ticket lost. the 25RM is nothing to the thief if he were to drive away your car.</p>
              <p>hence, the need to get further proof of documentation, etc. so they are protected in case of being accused to being lax. the thief will also not be able to leave the premise with the car if they cannot furnish these details.</p>
              <p>you should be glad that they are asking you that level of identification so that no one can drive away your car easy. their procedure may not have been most efficient, and if you don't speak malay well, there could be some misunderstanding. nor you may not like their work attitude. regardless, you get to drive out safe. you could have gone to where you park the car and find another car parked there.</p>
              <p>first of all, your fault. why can't you keep your parking ticket properly. you fault others for your complacency and carelessness.</p>
              <p>secondly, i will park at city square more often, because now i know they are pretty stringent over loss ticket.</p>
              <p>you sent out the wrong message. just don't lose your ticket again.</p>
              <p> </p>
