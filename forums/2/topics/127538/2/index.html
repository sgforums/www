            <div class='col-md body'>In most of the scenario where manufacturer shift their production from a High-cost country to a lower cost country. The quality of the production will sure dropped and it is their marketing department that requires to fixed this problem by saying the lower-cost country have the same or better facilities and very good QA controls over the high cost country. Thus the quality shouldnt dropped at all.<br><br>But if this is the case, why the Made in Thailand ford, vios, city, soluna all have pple complains about built problems?<br><br>Another thing to note:<br><br>1. If Thailand facilities is better than Japan as what Toyota states. Y Toyota branded exports cars like Vios, Corolla Altis, Camry manufacture in Thailand whereas the Lexus branded exports cars are manufacture in Japan??<br><br>Does that means Lexus built quality is slightly inferior than Thailand made as the facility is not as good??<br><br>Wonder ..... just a cents for thought.<br><br>As far as I know where I worked with Thailand counterpart before, their skilled workers is not as skilled as folks in Japan. Labour is cheap but doesnt mean quality is there.<br><br>But then again, that doesnt mean their quality wouldnt improves but just donno when.<br><br>I do notice something too about Vios that the plastic they used is no longer as good as those found in Japan made Toyotas. Whereas, Hyundai for the new series of cars, I found that their interior is getting better. Korean made stuffs doesnt mean more inferior than other countries.<br><br>In summary, I found that Toyotas are making more $$$ selling Thailand made cars than cars manufacture in Japan mainly<br><br>1.

I heard a few industry bringing there production back to Japan......think getting a little off topic here.<br><br>Coming back. Pay for what you can offer.
