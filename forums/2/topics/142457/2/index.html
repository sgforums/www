In recent years, US demand has risen because of strengthening economic recovery. China's demand is far outstripping their production of oil.<br>The OPEC cartel accounts for half of the world's supply of crude oil and attempts to manipulate prices by limiting production. Market speculators have also exacerbated oil prices. Given the dramatic upward trend of oil prices, it looks like we are headed for an oil crisis similar to the one in 1973, when the complete dependence of the world on oil became painfully clear. The impact of an oil crisis is severe, as fuel shortages will turn the economy into a recession. Workers will be laid off and only the very rich can afford petrol.

If the current trend goes unchecked, i'm afraid we'll be facing the worst oil crisis in history. Oil companies used to hold massive stockpiles to ease supply shortages. In recent years, these stockpiles have been drastically reduced to improve efficiency. Be prepared for the worst. The price of oil will double to more than US$100 a barrel within three years, triggering an economic collapse. There will be widespread retrenchments and the country's infrastructure will be crippled.</div>
