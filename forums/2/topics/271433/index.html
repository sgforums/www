            <div class='col-md body'>Auto car usally got 4 drive trains.. or transmission<br><br>Higher ends one have 5AT, usually u find many 4AT<br><br>4AT = Gear L or 1, Gear 2, D then Neutral, then Reverse.<br><br>Some come with OD button or Over-Drive button.<br><br>For Gear L or 1 - It is used for situtation where u might be struck in mud or bad road condition and nid to get out. Gear 1 or Low Gear being the best gear possible to get out from a struck position. Note that Gear 1 will not automatically go to Gear 2. It will maintain at Gear 1 until u move the level to 2 or Drive. but for L gear, Low gear, it will automatically switch between Gear 1 and 2 to get out from a struck position or slope position.<br><br>For Gear 2, mainly for slope, especially for down slope. Example, coming down from genting. it will maintain at Gear 2 until u move the level to Drive or others.<br><br>For D or Drive, it will automatically switch from Gear 1 to the highest gear based on speed. To be used in all normal driving condition.<br><br>For OD or overdrive, it's main purpose is to push the car faster at relatively higher speed. Like when u driving north-south Highway in Malaysia and needed to pick up speed to over the 100km/hr, u can use OD to make that come about faster cos it will use the 2 or 3 gear longer before switching to the higher gear or fuel efficiency gear. Note also that the RPM meter will shoot pass 3k rpm or more before switching gears in OD mode. Usually, ard 2-3k rpm, the gear usually would have automatically switch to the next higher gear.<br><br>If still in doubt, try reading up at howstuffworks.com<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey dude,<br><br>yes, I understand. Just that I like to explore these gears since money spent already should utilise mah.<br><br>would it be damaging if say driving in D gear at say 80km/hr or higher and then shifting to gear 2? I mean, would shifting from  D at high speed ( i not a racer lah. so 80 is high) to 2 bring any damage to gear or engine?<br><br>Another reason I asked is I not sure would it help to speedup if I make us of power gears 2  and D by shifting between them gears?<br><br>any reply would appreciate lor.<br><br>cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like when on 90km/hr u wanna overtake and require extra power, use the OD(over-drive) button. it will drop one gear and u haf more power. or, u can do a double tab on ur accelerator. auto still can play one. just see how u play lor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Friends!<br><br>I learnt driving using manual car and my car  is auto. That is why I not completely sure about auto gears. I like this forum. There are many helpful forummers and I am glad to become a junior member.<br><br>In manual, there is a clutch to handle when shifting gears.<br>In Auto , there is no visible clutch to operate by driver.<br><br>Another scenario : lets say I am driving at 80kph, D mode, and suddenly see a high slope to climb.  Am I right to say I can engage the gear 2 to climb this by 1st  reducing the speed to Gear 2 level  ?  Or should I use OD mode for climbing?  I am not clear how the auto system switch between gears as I cannot see or control the clutch. And thus I am concerned about gear / engine damage when shifting gears, for example, when climbing slope when the car is not starting at gear 1 or 2 but at gear D 60-80kph.<br><br>Can I also say that gear shifting is ok in auto gear as long as I match the gear with the car speed at time of shift?<br><br>Lastly, is it not advisable to use the OD frequently even when it is used appropriately like at the right situation?<br><br>Thanks again Friends !!<br><br>Regards<br>R.<br><br></div>

I think your auto gear will know how to drop to a lower gear when your car gets on an upslope, so no need to use "2" or OD... and no worries about damaging your gears...<br><br>Just wanted to say that I've destroyed a gear box once by shifting to "2" while running a high speed... so take care!<br><br>I guess OD would wear out your engine faster lah,... it's like always dragging your gears for a manual txn,...</div>

Needs abit of experience to get it right.<br><br>When i jus floor e accelerator e speed was like picking up slightly fast, but when i tried e "double tab", i took 2-3 tries to get it right, e pickup was very very fast, so I knew it had to b enable by double tapping.  But i dunno if it goes for other makes of cars..  I tried on my car it wasn't very obvious such tt i dunno whether it was jus "flooring" or "tap"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS, btw wat auto car u driving?<br><br>hmm... juz share wif u guys wat i noe abt toyota.<br>Overdrive is to be on-ed at all times for fuel efficiency, off it under conditions such as towing another vehicle.<br>if u want fast pickup, higher revs, use the ECT or Super ECT (depending on the make of ur toyota).<br><br>many toyota drivers do not noe abt this ECT or Super ECT n thus do not utilise it. the ECT or Super ECT is extremely useful in msia when u wanna overtake another car fast.<br><br>u can oso try switching on the ECT or Super ECT n then try accelerate from 0 to 100km/hr, u will be able to rev till 6 - 7k rpm easily but better dun whack too hard. u will be surprised how fast an altis or camry can accelerate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seriously drive auto car in singapore, basically u onli need to know hw to shift to D, P, R and N. onli if coming down from steep slope like what other seniors said above, genting highlands, it's best to engage gear 2. it has higher power n thus more engine brake. in D mode, if e car realise it is picking up speed as e car slides down e slope, it will automatically engage a higher gear n goes on. in tis case, there is not much control of e car as no engine brake. tis is why u see so many reports on pple crashing when driving down genting highland. see, for certain car double tap does auto drop one gear n give u stronger boost. if it can't work for ur car den try to floor e accelator, e car will sense it after like 1 or 2 sec depending on hw gd ur car is. for some auto cars, there is tis mode call e DS. a small S sign beside e D. it will also boost ur car too.</div>
