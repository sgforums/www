I've heard him mention stuff like Hondata, cam, volk racing but seriously, i have no idea what are they.

Actually, it's my boyfriend's coming birthday and I was just thinking if I should get him something for his new car (he's a car fanatic and always talking about car projects). However, I am quite clueless about the technical stuff and have no idea how or who should I seek directions from. I've heard him mention stuff like Hondata, cam, volk racing but seriously, i have no idea what are they. Is anyone able to offer some advice on what would be practical and perhaps within a budget of 1.5k? </span></div></blockquote>1.5k can get a decent setup of sound system for his car. further more u and him can enjoy it together. which is also good. and it can also be removed and switched to ur future car.  consider it</div>
