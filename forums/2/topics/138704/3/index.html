            <div class='col-md body'>woah... so glad i stumbled on this post man. i'm oso thinking abt wat to buy for a car-fanatic bf. but my budget not as high.<br><br>well, i think tt unless u r super rich n 1.5k is like nothing to u, it's best to juz bring him down to e workshop n c how he would wanna spend e new-found $$. tt'll be a v sweet surprise liao. n the thot of u willing to part w so much of ur own $$ would be like.. "wow!" the bottom-line, guys r juz a practical bunch.<br><br>else, the carbon fibre bonnet looks really great i think. esp w a white car. n esp if it's an integra. it's really nice. if u wan an idea of how e carbon fibre will look w a white car, look at e most obvious eg: initial d's ae86. suede...<br><br>next in line would prob be a change of rims. bigger rims can improve a car's cornering speed too. but i hav no idea wat r e specs of a stock integra.<br><br>other thots.. maybe u can make a personalized sticker? can make e car look fiercer n add a personal touch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>hope u dun mind if i ask a few qns of my own here... (i posted a thread but e replies were scarce  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ) i was thinking of sponsoring new tyres 4 my bf. wat kinda tyres would be gd for a civic es vti? he's using 16-inch forged rims now. not sure abt e wheel profile though... my other choice: titanium heavy weight gear knob. recommendations?</div>
