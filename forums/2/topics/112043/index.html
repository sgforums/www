That explains the design, which I totally agree with you that it has tamed down in terms of aggressiveness of the R34.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>R34 is a famous car because of race repuation<br>Japan Touring Car (JTC) - Won 29 race out of 29 race from 1989 to 1994<br>In 1994, because of its dominance, the Skyline was given its own series in 1994 the JGTC, (Japan GT car) series.<br><br>In 1991 Nurburgring 24 hour endurance race (First participation) Skyline GT-R<br>won the Group N class. At the Spa Francorchamps 24 hour endurance race 1991 the GT-R won overall beating Group A, and Group N1 cars. From 1991 -1997 the Skyline was undefeated in N1 endurance racing in Japan, winning 50 times.<br><br>To win with such dominance, it need to be a good car, and it is.<br>2.6-litre engine DOHC Twin Turbo producing 276bhp and capable of handling over 600bhp without internal modifications. It also comes with electronically controlled AWD system, the ATTESA E-TS system an electronically controlled all wheel drive system. When the computer senses a loss of traction it automatically sends up to 50 % of the torque to the front wheels. Under normal conditions the car remains rear wheel drive. It also has a four wheel steering system.<br><br>As for bhp and torque, this is one of the most common question asked in motoring and yet no one can really provide a complete distinction to it. Basically, bhp has something to do with max speed while torque has got something to do with the car acceleration, ceteris paribus. Please correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>Yes, by changing the stroke and turbo-charging + some heavy modifications, a 2000cc car can achieve 600bhp that a 6000cc car produce. The difference is the damage done to the engine and the fuel consumption. A 6000cc V12 engine can easily travel at 300kmh on a highway without much problem. A heavily modified 2000cc car struggles to keep at speed 300kmh, if in the first place if it is able to do so. Very soon, it will run out of breath. Chances of engine blow is rather high. It may not be wise to just look at bhp (and torque) alone to determine the car performance. There are still many other factors to be taken into considerations (engine efficiency, engine overheating, maintainance of engine etc)<br><br>Hope that answers some of your questions... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

GT-R brand will be seperated from the Skyline bloodline from the R35 onwards, and the GT-R will be an entirely different model.<br>LOL. Skyline is so famous in the touring car scene. As early as the R32, they have been involved heavily in FIA GT, esp Le Mans. The famous Nismo R400 raced at Le Mans against cars like the McLaren F1 GTR and the Ferrari F40 GT. Also, the skyline is very famous in the JGTC series.<br>Famous skylines include the R33 and R34 pennzoil skylines:<br><img src="http://racing.jbskyline.net/2001/Gallery/Bilder/2001%20JGTC%20Pennzoil%20front%20right2.jpg"><br><br>Falken Skyline which competed at the Nurburgring 24hours enduro:<br><img src="http://www.gt-eins.de/Bilder/bfglm02/24hnring/044-001.jpg"><br><br>Calsonic R33 and R34 Skylines:<br>R33:<br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/motorcity/speedway/4868/skyline-02.jpg"><br>R34:<br><img src="http://racing.jbskyline.net/2001/Gallery/Bilder/2001%20JGTC%20Calsonic%20front3.jpg"></div>
