            <div class='col-md body'>Here is my advice -<br><br>Firstly, learn all the theory about safety, road regulations and such. Learn to control you're vehicle and be cohesive in the way you handle it (<span style="font-style: italic;">this does not mean drive at snail pace through every corner you take</span>). Simple enough and it won't take much effort if your determined to drive.<br><br><strong>Then </strong>-<br><br>Dont be afraid to use the accelerator. For some reason, most folks who take their license test here, and most P platers here, drive as if their car has blown a head gasket. Its there for a reason, and the testors are really sensative about this - as long as you are under the limit, accelerating swiftly is actually a positive attribute rather than something you can get marked down on.<br><br>If you want to pass you're practical ttest, remember this, and please for my sake don't forget this once you get your P's as i've had enough of sitting behind jokers driving at 50 on the highway with nowhere to go. Lets not make everday driving in Singapore more lifeless and slow-motion than it already is.<br><br>And thats it.</div>

Well, nothing you can do about it now so just reflect and learn from your mistakes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Anyway from what you mentioned, you should have anticipated to stop a little earlier than the front car if you should see a cab and a person standing beside the road flagging for a cab cause most likely something is going to happen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Unless you did not even notice the person flagging for the cab then bo bian.<br><br></div>
