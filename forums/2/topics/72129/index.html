Insurance i still dun think RX8 is cheaper coz i have frens who wanted to get RX8 but was deterred by the insurance quoted. Both are cars with a diff class. Depending on wat the buyer is lookin out for. Ur 1.6 can be on par? thats impressive.. Turbo charged ur car? Dun think u have met a real euro R.

Depending on wat the buyer is lookin out for. Ur 1.6 can be on par? thats impressive.. Turbo charged ur car? Dun think u have met a real euro R.

RX8 is a 4-door sports car. The look is entirely up to individual, both can be kitted to be very nice/fierce, both stock dun look very nice. Euro R brand new is about $125-128K, RX 8, I'm not very sure. But the 5 speed n 6 speed one differs in price, bhp, and if u notice, looks in terms of rims and fog lights. Power wise, I believe euro R will be powerful, new Euro R is using K20a, Integra type R and Civic type R engine. Only setback is that it is heavy, so it doesnt performs exactly similar to DC5. But euro R is fast, compared to Rx8 5 speed. Rx 8 6 speed, i believe will be on par with a euro R, maybe slightly faster. Reason being i have sat in both new n old euro Rs.<br><br>New euro R is quieter, very smooth, old euro R is very raw, slighlt more noisy. Power quite impressive. have tailed a Rx8 5speed, with the older batch euro R, dunno if its the owner dun dare to play, or haven run in, but its not super impressive.<br><br>Btw, insurance for RX8 is under 4 door sports car, its still about those 3-4k range for young drivers. Euro R insurance will be cheaper, abt &lt;2k for young drivers. Anyway Euro R will have more boot space, n passenger space. Both are getting rare, not many colors to choose from. Or if u want, can consider the CL1, the previous batch of euro R. Only about 30-40 of them in Sg. very rare. If u interested in CL1, private msg me. Hope this helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>you sure that rx8 insurance is 3k-4k?<br>its a four door seat &amp; 1.3cc( although,it was rotary x 2 ) car.</div>
