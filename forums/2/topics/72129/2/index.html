It is the process of owning a car that u like, satifsy u(urself only) in terms of the looks, power. Its not to show off to people.. I also think that pple who trying to show that their car is more powerful by rushing off to the next traffice light only to stop again by the red light is dumb.. I m answering the fella's qn of my opinion of both cars.. not ur car faster or which car faster.. u misunderstood my msg. I dun have a license, I'm only 18.. u think u noe more about cars then me, good. thats ur problem. but dun think becoz of my age u think i sure dun know anything about cars... I m a car lover.. and its not based on ur age that u will know more...<br><br>I might be wrong in terms of the insurance.. but then its up to pple to check it out themselves if they are really interested.. cool off la.. i dun intend to argue with u on the insurance or watever here.. everyone is here to learn more about stuffs that they dun know.. juz correct me if i'm wrong..  no need to tok about racing or whose car faster.</div>

I was a civic EG6 owner and i really like Honda... my frens owns EP3 and DC5, all the K20 engine.... but the problem with euro R is that the car is heavy so it is really SLOW!! brakes also problematic cos it is weak, handling so so only.... it was my dream car for about a year.... wanting badly to buy it and get the defi meters to match that car!! and then the RX8 came out, looks cool.... but only for looks, performance is not so good in terms of power cos it is not a turbo charged.... as for the insurance on euro r... for a below 30 years old with full discounts 50 + 5%, still got to pay like S$2048 from ntuc.... for RX8 i dunno cos i was not really interested in that car....<br>so i went car hunting, i wanted something which was 4 doors and had good power..... then i chance upon the WRX GD a and GD b (my03) and asked my many frens who owned that car.... if u have the budget of S$130k and below... i think it is worth it to get the STI wrx cos it comes with all the good features like brembo brakes, 6 speed gear box, turbo charged.... 265 bhp on standard spec(uk), WRX was never my favourite car list as it was so expensive.... since now the price had gone down by so much..... then i think it is really worth to get 1 now.... as for the standard rex at 225bhp, it is selling at about S$105 to S$106k.... damn cheap! insurance is about S$1800+ for someone who is over 30 years old and with fully discount 50 + 5%. as for euro r, there is also not much potential for improving horsepower for now..... and can be easily taken down by a big durian civic.....<br>but if u insist that only choosing btw euro r and rx8, i will choose a euro R..... looks good anytime!!</div>
