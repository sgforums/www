            <div class='col-md body'>Reverse into the lot at a 45 degree angle until the entire length of your boot is just aligned with the bonnet of the car behind you (with sufficient space of course), then turn the steering wheel to reverse the car fully into the lot.

Thats the trick and never 100% trust reverse sensors. Once you got all that you can park in the tightest of parellal lots.</div>

I just have one more qns in addition to the above will do: hope you could help clarify ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Since the steps for left-side parallel parking is finally clear, may i ask if does this work on right side parallel parking too?? (except reversing all the action appropriately such as instead turn left, turn right etc ... )<br><br>or is there any changes we should look out for or make during right hand side parallel parking ???<br><br>Thank you much !<br><br>Regards.....<br><br></div>
