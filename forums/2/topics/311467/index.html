              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>I'll get straight to the point as the title is pretty much self explanatory. According to my dad, this issue has constantly resurfaced time and time again despite the numerous police complaints made. The time in-between each mass car-scratching incidents averages around a few months and the perpetrator scratches indiscriminately so it can't possibly be an individual issue.</p>
              <p>I'll leave out the exact details of my location as these details are besides the point, however  for the sake of discussion, I'll just go as far as saying that I live in the East Area.</p>
              <p>Im sure most of us folks that park our cars in the HDB multi-storey carparks have more or less experienced such incidents at least once in our lifetimes. What I would like know is what relevant actions did the authorities in your immediate area do? e.g Installing of cameras in the parking lots, forming neighbourhood watch groups etc. Or did they simply step up their patrol routines for a few weeks but only to stop it after the commotion has died down?</p>
              <p>In addition, I would like to hear from you guys what in your opinion would be a feasible resolution to rectify such wilful acts of vandalism, besides merely reporting to the police, as far as your past experiences are concerned.</p>
              <p>If theres any police folk around here, feel free to give your comments and feedback regarding this issue.</p>

              <p>These are nice reasonable suggestions, but im afraid their uses are limited in preventing mass car scratching incidents.</p>
              <p>For our current situation, the cars in our carparks there get scratched like every couple of months and its obvious that the local authorities aren't doing or can't do anything to prevent such incidents.</p>
              <p>Are the cars in HDB multi-storey car parks really subjected to the whims of such wilful vandalism that we can't do anything about it? Perhaps you have encoutered such a situation before? And if so, what action did your local authorities did to stop such incidents from re-occuring?</p>
              <p>Anyway, around 5-6 cars were scratched last week on the same deck that my car parked on, again. My dad doesn't even bother to re-spray the car anymore. Yes, its that serious.</p>

              <p>Brutus, you mean you did an internal car cam installation to catch the vandals red-handed?</p>

              <p>As a matter of a fact, I was considering whether to leave notes on the windscreens of all the parked cars in the multi-storey carpark, informing them of this serial car scratcher (assuming its always the same fella) and to keep their eyes open. Then again, its kind of like stating the obvious though. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>You want some advice? The police have better things to do, bigger fish to fry. If you want something done right, get together as a community. Organize &amp; discuss which floor of the carpark you want to string up the culprit from when you do apprehend him/her. Probably a guy though, women where got so bo liao do this kind of thing...? Anyway, before you hang the fool, give him a good hammering, maybe a tyre iron or something. Don't kill him or anything like that, it would seriously undermind our legal system and things of that nature. Police officers will do what they can but know that this car vandalism thing is not top on their To Do List. Better yet, you spot the vandal..., call police, say you saw <strong>Mas Selamat</strong> loitering. That'll give that inconsiderate hoodlum a good scare.... LOL...</p>
              <p>On a more serious note, really... get organized with fellow drivers that use that carpark. Catch him before he starts causing serious damage.. All the best... Hope you nail his balls to the wall. :)</p>

              <p>HDB does not install cameras for season parking owners.</p>
              <p>and you are right, almost all cars in HDB have been scratched. Almost all. If not All.</p>

              <p>as far as we know,</p>
              <p>HDB does not install cameras for season parking owners.</p>
              <p>and you are right, almost all cars in HDB have been scratched.
              Almost all. If not All.</p>
              <p>the difference is only how badly they have been scratched and I
              mean scratched on purpose.</p>
              <p>its a known and perennial issue.</p>
              <p>when people are not happy, they do many things.</p>
              <p>and its easy to get away with it. No cameras.

              <p>It is true that HDB does not install cameras at the multi-storey carparks, however they do install cameras in the lifts of certain HDB estates in order to curb the waves of crime in areas where old people or women were mugged in the lifts.</p>
              <p>So unless the mass car-scratching situation warrants the attention the authorites deem to be the equivalent of the mugging incidents in lifts, I agree with you that HDB would never install cameras for the season parking owners.</p>

              <p>I understand that the problem isn't going to go away, however we a society as a whole, or at least the folks living in the nearby estates aren't doing anything affirmative to prevent or stop this situation.</p>
              <p>It seems as if were making it too easy for such vandals to commit random acts of vandalism on their own free will.</p>
              <p>Is it purely a collective dejected resignation to fate or are we really that ignorant?</p>
              <p>I would claim that its more of a diffusal of responsibility among all the season car parking owners, with each thinking that its not their responsibility to take some necessary action and to wait for someone else to do it as their cars were victimised as well.</p>
              <p>The situation is the status quo not because we live with it but rather everyone else is just too ignorant/selfish/lazy to expend that additional effort and push for some real action to be undertaken by our local authorities.</p>
              <p>I, for one, would like to break this vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>This would lead me to my primary objective of this thread: To solicit any suggestions/methods/experiences that you folks and the police residing in the other parts of SG have and to compare and contrast these with what the local authorities in my area do.</p>
