            <div class='col-md body'>Let me ask you good people in here for your opinions and views regarding the following scenario:<br><br>I was about to park in the MSCP at my place. I usually park on the 4th level, and there was this car in front moving slowly. As we reached the 3rd level, I saw the hazard lights blinking. I applied my handbrake, and turned on my own hazard light to wait for him/her to park. I waited 20 seconds, and still the car in front was not making any move to reverse into the lot (the car is now diagonally positioned to enter the lot in reverse), so I honked briefly - a short jab on my horn. The car moved a little, and jam brake and waited some more for no apparent reason.<br><br>So, I waited also without honking - I got all night to wait if the other party wants to play waiting game. Then after one full minute, the car starts to reverse. As it reversed into the lot, I can see that it was a lady driver, with a male passenger appearing to be teaching her how to park. So I stared at them with my mouth agape and a puzzled expression.<br><br>Odd thing was, after I parked my car on the 4th level, as I walk down I could see the male passenger standing at the other end of the MSCP with his arms on his hips!<br><br>Am I supposed to know, that  the driver was a learner? Where's the 'L' plate? Are people allowed to learn or teach parking in HDB MSCP? Was my short blast of my car horn too much? Should I have waited 10 minutes before honking instead of 20 seconds?<br><br>I don't see others being that patient with me when I'm parking.....<br><br></div>
