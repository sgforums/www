U're supposed to be training to be a gd racer. These sort of logical decision making skills are supposed to be second nature. how can u make this kind of mistake? So no more next time ok?

No amount of writing will make them change their minds - and to a certain extent I am happy with that. Let them not consider the evo, pls. Chances of insurance premium going up is less due to lower incidents. There must be a reason why subaru drivers and even BMW drivers are changing to evos now... SEI should know some of them from the BMW club.</div>
