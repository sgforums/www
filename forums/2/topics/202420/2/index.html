If we were in this car... I think I wouldn't be writing this right now... The car we were in was a '98 Subaru Impreza by the way... Got hit by a Holden station wagon...<br><br>In the end, it's not totally about how someone drives, since accidents can and do happen, even if you are careful, the other driver might not be...

They obviously have no regards whatsoever to safety, not even to the tiniest degree, so we can forget about our comfort, performance, reliab..bla...bla...bla. I would hate to see people wasting their money on this.<br><br>FX1: Yes although criticism by itself is not necessarily always the most welcome response, we are serious here when we say this is worse than a piece of sh1t.<br><br>Despite them being new in the automotive industry, there is absolutely no excuse for them to produce such a vehicle. And for that kind of price, you are not just paying for some junk. You're paying your respect (and lots of money) to hypocrisy in its meanest form - a commie bas7ard ripping your money off in the most capitalistic manner. For 30k, I'd rather buy and older second hand car, filled with technology that's modern enough to make this P.O.S look like something that predates bicycles. There's really no excuse for making something this horrifically, abysmally, appalling. Until they get better, it's only criticism that I would give them.</div>
