            <div class='col-md body'>The LTA &amp; Tp are now claming down hard on mod. As long as visible from the exterior, they will take down plate number, pictures of it. This includes, kangeroo bar, spot lamp uncovered, visible under chassis neon lights, illegal mod exhaust etc etc.<br>If it is damn obvious like kangeroo bar etc, they will send letter  c/w summon to the owner house. If suspected of heavy mod in the engine bay, they will either wait for the owner near their car or send a letter to ask them to go LTA inspection center within 24 hrs.<br>So far I only heard of 1 person kenna within 24hr car inspection package... lolz..<br><br>This is to say its best to keep the car original on the outside. But inside... as long they cannot see from outside they dun bother.<br><br>Normally they aim cars which are ricey and loud in appearance.<br><br>So far areas affected which I heard are MSCP @ CCk, BB, SK, NT, PSR.<br><br>Hrmm... Maybe the Tp should do road block @ Nee soon dam or WC mac or SK or CV at night during the weekends when alot of dare devils comes out and nail them in 1 shot... lolz..</div>
