            <div class='col-md body'>Haha amusing thread. But I must say the Thread Title was a little provocative...so I guess celica fans might take it the wrong way.<br><br>Anyway, I've driven an Evo 7, DC5, WRX, Celica SS2 and Rx8 and had the fortune of owning 3 of the above mentioned cars previously.....<br>well I guess all the cars have their good and bad points...no point comparing which car more powerful and which car faster...becos there is always a faster car than yours.....and if you wanna talk about mods and pro-tuning, then it will be an endless debate.<br><br>There will be people who would love your car or hate your car no matter what car you drive, so I think it is pointless to argue becos if you hate a car....face it you would hate it no matter what others say about it....and if you love a car...well you're entitled to your own opinion and you would probably stick to it.<br><br>I've always kept an open mind about cars....used to hate WRX but when I drove my friend's car for a week when he was out of town....It was a really fun car to drive.....and quick as well.<br><br>On the topic, stock to stock, the DC5 is of course faster. But I loved the celica 'cos it looked kindof fierce with bodykits and all. Out of topic but I went to Sepang once and raced a stock WRX using a DC5 and an RX8 both stock. And I actually lost to the WRX in the DC5 but beat him in the RX8....was quite amazed...but maybe driver factors came into play?.....dunno......<br><br>Well to each his own. Peace.</div>
