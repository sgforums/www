            <div class='col-md body'>while there are girls who skilled driving then the average guys on the road.. still the majority are a bit inconsiderate (i dont want to use the word lousy).. road hogging, anyhow cut lane etc and also.. parking.. this is an area most of them have problems with esp the tai tais who drive the suvs.. they can hardly estimate their vehicle size!</div>

Then lights turn green guys and girls alike, like need a few seconds to react one. Sianz.<br><br>inconfident? ahahaha. i know a few guys who are inconfident. but worse, most male drivers are OVERCONFIDENT. And thats why there are more accidents by guys. Luck can only keep u safe so much.<br><br>Inconsiderate, hah. I already kp about male drivers who straddle 2 lanes la. then add in those cut lane no give signal, better still, cut lane never check MIRROR AND BLINDSPOT, turn out from small lane like want to commit suicide one, anyhow park one... etc etc. so many are male drivers. want to say inconsiderate, male drivers really not much better. probably worse. couple inconsideration with over-confidence, and u have a receipe for disaster.<br><br>unaware of surroundings? lets drop that in with inconsideration shall we? all those straddle 2 lanes one nvm. im behind them and they seem to cannot see a whole car behind them. like i said, drive never check mirrors one. wah kaoz.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the be fair enough, i have seen female drivers who are very skillful, and male drivers who are clumpsy. Let's not talk who is better and what not.<br><br>personnaly i think most people nowadays like to use auto rather than manual cars. Well, as well known, auto is very easy to drive, no challenge at all. Evryone can be extremely skillful when it comes to auto. But a manual car is more difficult to drive because rather than maneuvering the car, one needs to take care of the gear.<br><br>To be a good driver=safe+smooth+fast+fast in corner<br><br>Anyone one wanna race with me? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>By the way, i am really fast in corners.....and i use manual</div>
