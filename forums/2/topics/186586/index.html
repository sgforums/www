Not to change tyres during race so, ferrari and bridgestone were caught up! Not enough time for ferrari and bridgestone to do the developements on their tyres as bridgestones says they not enough teams to test their tyres accept minardis and jordan so the info is not there unlike the michelins (if i spell correctly)... and not also that.. the F1 car is designed by aldo costa instead of Rory Bryne which his design is a full success... But remember, Ferrari need a fresh designers etc2 before all the old staff like john todt, brawn, martinelli comes to retire.. so they can, i mean 'teach' them to be a success..<br></div></blockquote>sigh. u really aren't making this hard for me.<br><br>M'dear, ALL this "inside" info u're telling us, is a matter of fact, public information. One can easily glean any of this info from F1 news websites to F1 and autosports magazines.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FERRARIman:</div><div class="quote_body">Ferrari has shake up the camps.. and this what happen... ! quite frustrating but it's ok.. its a sport, we can't always be on top! So i think the new guys<br>will be a success in the future not now... but years to come.. not easy remember ferrari is not that good in the 90's... after all these guys came to ferrari in 1995... 1996 (study year), 1997, (settle down but close to win the title for schumy, 1998 (raise the technology) 1999 -2004 (domination year!)</div></blockquote>This is just common sense. I could have told u this even if I weren't an ardent F1 follower.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FERRARIman:</div><div class="quote_body">For schumacher's case. Honestly, if i were him, i juz retire on the high honestly. But.. he loves the sport, he juz love to drive. So when he retires? well... i think this is intresting, if ferrari dont win in san-marino.. hmmm then u gonna hear what he says... but i have information from the ferrari camp. It says... they use the 248F1 version 2 in san-marino! haha... and they have been testing dat car like hell.. well wait and see....! U might asked why ferrari has done badly in Australia and both are out? well if u are a racer dat drives alot of racing cars, i'm sure u will understand the tyre world accurately than us! In Australia GP, Ferrari is unable to shine their pace its because THE TYRES AGAIN, the bridgestones tyres are not up to the temperature for schumacher which he has no "bite", but after the second set of tyres (after the pitstop) LOOK! how fast is he when he catch up near jenson Button! because he says (schumacher) the tyres is up to the right temperature and he able to do the speed... but he actually oversped and hit the "grass hump" loss ctrl and kiss the wall! i think if schumacher not involve in the accident, he already passed jenson button and probably won the podium no.3.. but it crashed.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> So, it gaves u a clear picture why he don't want to retire... simple, because according to FERNANDO ALONSO and the way i see it after the second pit stop, MICHAEL SCHUMACHER IS STILL QUICK AND HUNGRY FOR MORE WINS!..... ok stop talking, lets watch san-marino GP and see what happen... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Your "information from the ferrari camp about them using the 248 V2 car in Imola? Old news, boy, old news. reported by a few sites over a week ago.<br><br>MS loving the sport and wanting to drive beyond 06? old news too. his decision to continue dependent on how this year(and San Marino) turns out? Old news...<br><br>Yes M'dear I understand what tyres mean for a racing car more than u ever will. So explain how come Williams on the same tyre could have lead the same GP and might have netted a podium if it wasn't for an engine failure. The point beyond me understanding the effects the tyres have on a racing car, is whether YOU, m'dear boy, understand the twin dynamics of dependence the tyres and the chassis have on each other. If your car is unable to work the tyres into their operating temperature range, is that the tyre's fault or the car's fault? I don't see Honda blaming the tyres alone for their not so sterling australian performance. The blamed an inability to work enough temperature into the tyre, which means the car takes some of the blame.<br><br>As for the other factor about the car's loss of speed in Oz, I wil point out to u further down in my reply. It has to do with the wings.<br><br>as for Schumacher. Yes hes a fast driver, but under pressure historically he's always shown that he cracks on the race track. And I think thats what happened in Australia. He started driving off the circuit and then crashed, plain and simple. And he's often cracked a lot while racing. Think back to the 2000-2004 period. For races where he did not start on pole, how often did he actually win a race by overtaking his opponents during a race? Never. He waits till the pitstops and then bang in fast laps. Sure he's skilled, wins the races, but it shows he can't overtake. And when it comes to wheel to wheel fighting, I've seldom seen him win a battle. Yes he is hungry for wins, yes he is quick and skilled but no, I do not think he's a consumate racer overall. As for whether he is going to retire, I don't think I could care less now that he's not dominating anymore. In fact when he was dominating, I didn't want him to retire. I wanted to see him beaten and thats what has happened.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FERRARIman:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm.. Remember, Ferrari has a super technology to do something.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Is only up to them!</div></blockquote>Ferrari sure has the super technology to do something alright. That something is to CHEAT.<br><br>I will point out that, for the 1st 2 races, Ferrari had the flexi wing, which they modified for Australia. According to Ferrari, the wings were modified for "performance reasons"<br><br>if so, then they must have screwed their R&amp;D up since that "performance" was more like "backwards performance"<br><br>in the 1st 2 races, the flexi wings either allowed the tyres to get up the their operational temperature quickly, or else they must have made up for the deficit of the tyres not being within their operating range. Either way, it had a positive performance effect for the car. In race 2 this was shadowed by Ferrari's engine woes. Come to australia, FIA must have told them secretly those wings are NOT LEGAL, which as a result, Ferrari have had to modify them. To maintain a public stand that they have not been found cheating, they claims the wings were modified for "performance reasons". I think the race itself has shown why those wings were really modified.<br><br>So I guess if u wanna blame something, don't blame the tyres. Blame Ferrari's inability to win without cheating when the going gets tough. sure its up to them. Up to them to play outside of the rules. Afterall, isn't life great when the FIA loves u? U get caught cheating and the FIA just gives u a "please don't do that" under the table. Not even a public rapping of its knuckles.</div>

Ok guys catch me on the other new thread to come!</div></blockquote>oo u wanna know why i have the enthuaism to debate in this topic?<br><br>simple.<br><br>1) before u call someone bro, make sure u're getting their gender right<br><br>2) making comments like 'last time i was as blur as u' is not being mature or professional because u make the assumption that people are blur when they're not, and because u're too lazy to check your assumptions against reality.<br><br>3) same thing, making comments like "u should act professionally and mature towards your rivals" is a no-brainer. Especially when u can't spell either word correctly. 1stly, U're implying that im not professional or mature. 2ndly, I am not their rival, nor am I competiting in the same series they are. I am offering an insight into their actions as a generic motorsport POV, and I don't have to mince my words if I don't like the fact that they don't play by the rules. 3rdly, respect is not demanded. it is earned. The fact that Ferrari has often had to skirt the rules is not something that has earned my respect, neither has Schumacher's ungentlemanly driving. Like I said, even within the industry, there are people who don't mince their words, I don't see why I should. U might see this as being unprofessional and immature, but I could equally claim that u're someone who is not straightfoward and the kind who hides a knife behind your smiles. The truth is, there is nothing immature and unprofessional in pointing out the obvious.<br><br>4) If u wanted to keep things professional, be mature, avoid revenge and simply garner opinions of the car itself, u wouldn't have said something like "i was right about the lights i beat heng@" because that was already downright immature. It goes against everything u've said to the contary. Now u say u're 39, but by that post u originally made before u edited it, i could have sworn u're a 12 yr old kid who gets kicks by being right about the number of lights. Also, i am sure it is professional and mature to say that u know about ferraris because u've visited maranello while the rest of us "poor turkeys" have never visited Ferrari's factory, hence we have no idea how they class their cars. So I guess because i never visited their factory, I do not know the Enzo is a super car, nor do I know it has a V12. That information is "inside info" only, just as the fact that Ferrari is introducing a updated version of their F248 at imola is also "insider info"<br><br>I don't care if u own a Ferrari, sell Ferraris for a living, or if u've got any special ties to them whatsoever. U come here trying to sound "holier than thou" with regards to ferraris, and can't even get simple facts right, u better just keep quiet. I've never had someone take PUBLIC formula 1 news and try to present it to me as "insider info". I mean, seriously, did u think we're all stupid here just because we've never visited maranello, or are u just a blur king?</div>
