Now then know the number is not infrared rej percent. But I still feel v-kool is very ex for the heat rej.

            <div class='col-md body'>Vk mirage is ok. During hot days when on a/c speed2 at 75% cold, the car can cool down quite fast as around 10mins. at night less then 1 min cold already. If you are hitting Vpower you will feel even colder fast.  But I must admit, when I fixed it at 599, its quite steep. The lifetime warrenty for defective or bad worksmanship is not a bad deal as long as you dun get your screen broken. Its actually proven that Vk is one of the best quality films in the market if compare to 3M or other brands.  But since you are using  for a MPV, the price definately will be steep. The $1400 u getting if i am not wrong is the highest grade approved by LTA . If you use mirage should be around 800 nowadays.</div>
