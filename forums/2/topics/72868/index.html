But you get some idiots who simply love to honk at me, esp when i'm cruising on the 1st lane of the Expressway, then honk at me to give way?? Can't they just signal or something?<br><br>Else, when at traffic light moving off, sometimes you move off a little slow cos distracted or sth, then you get pple honking at me, when the car beside me is still not moving too.

So i'm not sure, maybe he was really frustrated that you were in the overtaking lane when you shouldn't be. Would you rather he honk of sit on your arse?<br><br>I'm also a P plates.. and have been for the last 2 3/4 years.. I will get off my Ps this June. I don't see why you are complaining.. everyone else gets honked as well.

            <div class='col-md body'>When non p-platers see a p-plater driver on the road, they mostly have the mindset "they suck".<br><br>Well, if they(non p-platers) try those stupid stunts(overtaking then jam brake) on me, dun blame me for abusing my p-plate. If buang the best, seens this car goin to scrap liao, I dun mind getting more dents on the car, seen how pple drive the game called daytona? I'm goin to waste tat token of urs like how I'm going to waste ur brand new car on the expressway rail.<br><br>I'm drive on the left lanemost of the time, unless feeling kinky and wanna go 100&lt;. And if left lane some "hero" still wanna horn and flash headlight, my right leg will feel very tired and need a rest.<br><br>I hate to use the horn unless in a very dangerous situation, most of the time I only flash my high beam, and nothing else. And overtaking, if I can't overtake, I'll wait for a chance, no point horning and flashing at the driver in front for being slow, he's just being cautious, is there anything wrong with being cautious??<br><br>And yes kopi, can't you be a little more flexible? If you can't overtake by the right, overtake by the left, common sense right? Unless the left lane is too crowded, then I hope you can be more patient and tolerant.<br><br>Driving in the public roads is all about tolerance and courtesy, cos all of us is sharing the same old road. If one can't even understand shuold BASIC courtesy and be tolerant, I suggest one needs to give up one's vehicle license. No point putting danger to all the road users. Who thinks I'm wrong about this can frame me now.<br><br>And if u wan some kind of road tat noone blocks u when u overtake, take it to sepang circuit, the road is wide and clear, u can crash, smash, slam, screech, drift, slide, skid, smoke, ram, jam all u wan. I dunno bout the price though but prepare to pay, with ur pride when u found urself overtaken and lapped over and over again like there no tomorrow instead of overtaking pple.<br><br>And as for taxi drivers, gotta hate them, gotta love them. Bcos of their "heroic" acts, they make us more alert on the road, I thank them for tat, and my driving skills getting better bcos of them.<br><br>A word of advice to fellow p-platers, keep at least 2-4 cars lengths behind a taxi and try to predict wat they r trying to do next(be observant on the road), this will give you enuff time to react and will not catch you off guard.<br><br>If I offended anyone in my post above, I aplogise in advance. Just trying to make a point, not to start a war. Stay cool fellow drivers.</div>
