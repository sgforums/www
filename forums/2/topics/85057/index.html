I guess their rivals might be warning us of some possible gimmicks by some irresponsible used car companies.<br><br>Anyway,  you might want to go down to the car mart, check the car condition, iron out all the details and then maybe you could share your findings with us.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>99.9% of the time they placed such advertisment is to entice you to go down to check it out. They can even convince you it is so on the phone and even give you their name. But when you arrived, they will always give the following excuse:<br><br>a. Alvin? Oh, he went out to do some task. Can I help?<br>b. That car? Sold already or...<br>c. No lah...where got such thing or...<br>d. Show you other 'lemon' cars and claims they are better<br><br>There was one delaer at Goldhill Centre. I was tricked twice and I nearly lost my cool. What a waste of time and being pestered to buy.<br><br>The other time as at Turf City. Test drive a Lancer and the salesman ( a typical ah beng and its so typical, 8 out of 10 used car sales man are that catergory) insist I must buy. Tell him where got such thing. He told me business bad, he has not make a single sales in 2 months. He refused to let me go and call out his colleagues and even his boss( his boss picture always featured in the Classified Ads, so I recongise him instantly). Anyway, I threatened to call in the police, so they no choice but let me go but not without telling me to walk carefully, look out for cars (in hokkien).That, literally is a threat...<br><br>So be careful and stand your ground. They cannot force you to sign. As long as you don't sign anything, you are not obligated. Just walk away.<br><br>Also if you bring your gf or wife along, don't! Especially if they are young and attractive type. The ah beng salesman will be paying more attention to her and try to take mental advantage, if you know what I mean. They will even dare to whistle or pass lewd remarks at her, even with you next to her.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...guess 99% of the advert selling car at 10-15K are all bullshit. Ever called , ask them that if I bring down the 10-15k in cash..can I drive the car off without anything else..they simply say yes Yes yes....<br><br>The chance is that such advert is for car with COE ending Sept, Aug 2011...cause the COE is only 19-20K in 2001 for the mentioned months.<br><br>Once down, they will bring you to see the car...trying to make you love the car....but once you ask them the price...they tell you different story....saying the 13-15K is only for COE only....ask abt the 200++ instalment..they say that you have to fork out 20K for downpayment.....all the gimmicks....<br><br>Been to the one at beach rd, balestier.....all the same....so...guess don;t ever trust them....there are advert inthe ST...a pot calling kettle black....you get what I mean.....</div>
