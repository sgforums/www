            <div class='col-md body'>Dear friends, not sure if anyone happened to see this accident or knows anyone who saw it yesterday evening.<br><br>Place : Cross Junction of Alexandra Road / Lower Delta Road<br>Date : 1st September 2004<br>Time : About 1815 hrs<br>Involved : Mitsubishi Lancer, Nissan Urvan<br><br>I was travelling along Alexandra Road towards City(left most lane), traffic light was green (with no green arrow) and speed was about 60km/h. As i passed the traffic light, a Nissan Urvan turned right from the opposite flow of traffic into my path. I jammed my brakes and swerved the car to the left, but it was too late. A police officer passed by and helped direct traffic for us to shift to a side. The officer subsequently left as there was no injury. The van driver admitted that he was at fault as he assumed that i was turning left instead of driving straight. I asked him why he thought so as i had no signal light on. He apologised and promised to pay for repairs.<br><br>However, his boss called me later and accused me of being at fault and threatened to report police. I told him he got his facts wrong; he said he'll speak to his employee again. I have tried calling the driver again but he refused to answer. I sent the car in to IDAC and then went to workshop. They tell me it's 50:50 and its not clear cut that i'll win. So they want me to pay in full first then fight the case.<br><br>Any witnesses?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You might have won because there was an injury, to you. The poster's one I don't think so....had a similar case along the sliproad to CTE at Braddell, Nissan cabstar overtake from the left and rammed into the side of the car as the driver cut in front. IDAC also said 50:50 because its 'side damage'...complain to TP they say need eyewitness (on an expressway yeah right) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
