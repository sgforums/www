              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>By Ng You Liang</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A TRAFFIC accident can be an emotionally distressing affair. Struck with the double whammy of an injurious and potentially costly affair, a driver can easily panic and forget what to do.</p>
              <p>   The Motor Claims Framework (MCF), implemented in 2008, sought to redress that by providing clear and common procedures to follow in such an event.</p>
              <p>   Says Mr Peh Chee Keong, vice-president of Motor Insurance, NTUC Income: "Today's car owners are more aware of what to do in an accident, including having to report at approved reporting centres or approved workshops under the Motor Claims Framework."</p>
              <p>   Here are the steps to take if you are involved in an accident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #7030a0; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Check for injuries</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If someone has been injured, stay calm and call for an ambulance and the police immediately. No vehicles or people should be moved, but you should use vehicle breakdown signs or reflectors to warn other road users of the accident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #7030a0; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Important details</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Exchange particulars with the other party involved.Take down the registration numbers and names of insurance companies of all vehicles involved. Don't forget the names, identity card numbers, addresses and telephone numbers of the drivers, passengers, injured pedestrians and witnesses.</p>
              <p>   Also, remember to take photographs of the accident scene and the accident vehicles as well, including the damage sustained. This will also help you to resolve the accident claim. Once done, the accident vehicles can be moved to the side of the road so as not to obstruct other road users.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #7030a0; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Make a report</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You must make a police report as soon as possible or within 24 hours if the accident involves death or injury to a pedestrian or cyclist, or damage to a foreign vehicle, a government vehicle or property. Never allow unknown parties or touts to take your accident vehicle.</p>
              <p>   According to the Automobile Association of Singapore, sending your vehicle to an unauthorised workshop may result in inflated claims as your insurer has no control over the repair cost and quality. This may result in higher premiums during the next renewal.</p>
              <p>   Call your insurer's 24-hour hotline for a tow truck or for further advice. Some insurers such as NTUC Income, known as Orange Force, and Tenet Sompo have an emergency response service that will arrive at the accident scene within 20 minutes to provide onsite advice.</p>
              <p>   You should also report and take your accident vehicle to your insurer's appointed approved reporting centre or authorised workshop within 24 hours or by the next working day. This is regardless of whether your vehicle is damaged and irrespective of whether you are claimiDg from any insurers or third parties.</p>
              <p>   If you fail to report to your insurer with your accident vehicle, your insurer may reject your claim, or even claim from you sums paid by it for a third-party claim made against you. Your No Claims Discount (NCD) will be affected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #7030a0; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Filing a claim</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you decide to file a claim under your own policy, you should send your car to one of the insurer's approved workshops for repairs where an independent adjuster will assess the damage to your vehicle and negotiate the repair costs. Once the costs are agreed, your insurer will authorise the repairs. If there is any excess, you will he required to bear it.</p>
              <p>   However, if the damage is minor and the repair costs are low, you can opt to settle privately with the other party, maintain a clean record and enjoy your current NCD and premium on your policy renewal. But do make sure that the private settlement form is duly filled up and signed by both parties. If payment is involved in the settlement, the recipient must acknowledge receipt of the amount as well.</p>
