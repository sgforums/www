            <div class='col-md body'>I like to pose this question, because I find that a Daihatsu Extol though greatly lacking in pick up, has the ability to stay rather firm on the road at above 100KmH. Approx. 110Kmh<br><br>No wobbling, no rattle, no floating sensation, just pure wind rush and tyre hum. The engine just turns into a soft whine. ( Funny it sounded noisier at low speeds )<br><br>I do note however, that crosswinds ( wind blowing across an expressway )can affect steering on such a small van at high speeds.<br><br>Disclaimer: I normally DO NOT speed. I am lawy abidding motorist, I was just testing the stability of my van. Did once only. And it's back to doing 60Kmh or 70Kmh at best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey extol ah? good good. same class. i use suzuki carry. ever hit 120+ then scared already, slow down. i think stable up to 100 perhaps. at high speed, even gentle turn of steering also makes the van feel like want to overturn. our these carry/extol very light, cg very high, wheel only 13inch. maybe thats why.<br><br>hey was thinking up the wheels to 14inch, anyone knows can or not? as in any harm to the van? lta inspection? from 155R13 to say, 175/65R14? more stylo, and more choices of tires to choose.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hi Young_One,<br><br>( Me old one ..hehehe ), I don't think it would be a good idea to continue driving at such speeds. It's firstly against the Law, and secondly, foolish - because vans aren't built to travel safely above 100Kmh.<br><br>Sometimes, I feel it is necessary to speed up and overtake certain long trail of trucks and lorries that are moving too slow, and traffic on the center lane usually don't have patience for vans overtaking and going back into the left lane. So speed then, is needed. But not upto 160Kmh lah....<br><br>Wheels are small on Extol and Carry, and I believe if we install larger sport rims and tyres, it will surely add stability but will also increase fuel consumption because of roll resistance and drag of larger heavier rims and tyres.<br><br>I think if we stick to small wheels, changing tyres will be cheaper than having a large range of expensive sporty tyres to contend with.<br><br>However, I am thinking of changing the airfilter box to K&amp;N filters, and perhaps one of those air-intake booster units. I am also wondering if I am allowed to install a pair of front fog-lamps in the bumper of my Extol? The other thing I like are those chrome tube bumpers that wraps up from under the front of the bumper. Any leads on these two mods?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi STiYaKuzA,<br><br>I don't think it would be good for my Extol to run speed-tests. It is NOT BUILT for fast acceleration. It has high torque for hauling load, but not pick up.<br><br>On a hot afternoon/day, the engine is really sluggish due to heat build up and hot ambient air. But feels really good on rainy days and early mornings or late at night, when air is cooler.<br><br>Very bad for cornering without any cargo load. But feels really firm with at least half the max cargo load.<br><br>Engine runs quieter at high speeds, noisey at low speeds. Reverse gear noisey. Consumption fair in my opinion.<br><br>I removed the orginal beeper horn that came with it, and installed a twin Hella compact trumpets. Why? Because NO ONE could hear me with those blinking beeper horns! Nearly got squashed by a 6 tonner one time because he couldn't see me for my size, and my horn too soft. Stupid factory horns.<br><br>Now I have to be careful who I honk or get a black eye, or give an old folk a heart attack. These new twin compact trumpets are MEAN. Honk in a multistorey carpark and all floors will hear it. with echo even... 120db max</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey shutterbug, agreed, stability is best with some load. but that means fc up, so obviously i travel with no load most of the time. i also thinking put k&amp;n filter and cold air intake. dont know where got do, and in first place, possible for our vans or not. fog lamp i dont know, but the chrome thing you want on the bumper i think cannot. inspection cannot pass. i think those cars come standard with it, no choice. but extra fix ones are not allowed. by the way, how your fc ah? i get 12+ km/l, shell 98, air con always on. are you into ICE?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Young_One,<br><br>What, on earth, is ICE? Execuse me ah, but I not very into all these fashion trend thing. Even my handphone is fit for museum display.<br><br>My FC ( fuel consumption ) is around 10Km per litre, and I use Shell 92.<br><br>Well, too bad about those chrome bumpers. I am considering fitting a K&amp;N unit plus an air-intake booster. Later, will change the exhaust header, mid muffler, and tail-pipe muffler. Also put on a nicer looking tail-pipe.<br><br>I don't thinj it will make my van very fast or powerful, but I like the responsive feel of a mod vehicle. I can expect FC to increase a bit after these mods.<br><br>I asked about fog lamps over at www.eurovanclub.com and a forumer said that it is possible, but must be done by agent, and costs about $500 per pair. Rather ex, but they're approved ones.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey man. 500 is quite steep. what do you want the fog light for? really use? or for the look? if anything to do with lights at all, i was thinking change my bulb to those white light one. not HID, just white bulb. but also dont know if approved. my inspection coming end of the year, so removed the interior neon first. ICE ah, In Car Entertainment. the only thing i look forward to when taking a drive is listening to music. very satisfied with my setup. anyone else here into ICE for vans? i just changed to alpine head unit. very good. killer. highly recommend to anyone. i got the 9830. also do you know if sports rims and side skirts approved?</div>
