            <div class='col-md body'>Driving an Auto Car.<br><br>To D or not to D<br>This is the most commonly asked question by owners of automatic cars: Â“Should I put the lever to N, or leave it in D while waiting at traffic light junctions?Â” The answer is, leave it in D and use the brakes to hold the car at a standstill. All modern automatic gearboxes are designed to cope with this, so there is no unnecessary wear and tear on the mechanical components.<br><br>Frequently shifting from D to N and vice versa, however, puts strain on the gearbox and its electronically controlled solenoids. In the long run, this may result in premature failure of some components, and a hefty repair bill. ItÂ’s also a common misconception that holding the car with the brakes leads to additional wear and tear on the braking parts. Since the car is stationary, there is no friction between the pads and discs, so there is no extra wear.<br><br>My Question is , is our Picanto come with modern automatic gearbox that are designed to cope with this ??<br><br></div>

If got change see what I done to my present corolla interior and also the window area. Those are the things I learnt when I used to go to Singapore Toyota Corolla Club. Also think of design some decals now. Frankly speaking (no offence) the 2 decals to votes in Sg Kia Club don't really look nice.

            <div class='col-md body'>Did anyone realise that the Picanto is now more expensive, and C&amp;C is playing dirty by not reducing prices even though Cat A COE prices have dropped by over S$1,000 during the last 2 bids.<br><br>Take the example of the Picanto 1.1 manual<br><br>Launch price - S$49,999<br>1st price increase (21 May) - S$50,999<br>2nd price increase (11 June) - S$51,999<br><br>Since then, the last 2 COE bids ending 23 June &amp; 7 July have gone down by S$500 each time.<br><br>But C&amp;C has yet to pass the savings back to buyers by reducing the Picanto price. But the moment the COE price goes up, C&amp;C will be first to increase the Picanto price.<br><br>And it is very disappointing that with such high margins, they have not been securing COEs for buyers who have signed on the dotted line as far back as April. This is as good as being taken for a ride, only to be told to top up later.<br><br>Doesn't that make you feel like a fool?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

And I can understand that it gets even more fustrating when you have bought ALL accessories for your Picanto that has yet to arrive.<br><br>Jokes aside, well, we don't have to stage a demonstration. But if we could do what I did to Borneo Motors, it could do C&amp;C some damage &amp; wake them up.<br><br>Borneo Motors refused to honour the 3 year warranty for my Corolla, even though I had sent my car faithfully back to them for servicing (S$400 each time, compared to just over S$100 elsewhere) and there's no mods to my car.<br><br>My 4 external rubber window seals are all warped and causes rain to seep into the cabin during downpour &amp; when travelling above 100km/h, I get wind entering the cabin. Borneo refused to replace the faulty rubber seals, saying "This is normal". In fact, practically all Toyota owners in the Sigapore Toyota Club experienced this problem &amp; they are all pissed off to. And it's no use writing in to complain.<br><br>So what I did over a few weekends was to make trips down to Borneo's showrooms and mingle amongst the crowd. And I managed to convince a few potential buyers to consider Toyota's competitors' brands. I warned them about the problem I faced with my almost brand new Toyota, and these potential buyers were shocked. I even led some of them to my car and showed them the problem. This sure turned them off.<br><br>Every lost sale to Borneo Motors is victory to me! And I have posted this problem I faced, in almost all other car websites<br><br>These car distributors should be taught to treat their customers with integrity, respect &amp; some basic courtesy.<br><br></div>
