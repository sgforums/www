A cooler car requires less air conditioning.<br>- For the same reason, park in the shade when it's warm.<br>- Roll down a window instead of using your air conditoner.<br>- Clear your car of junk. Extra weight uses up gas.<br>- Get an update before you leave to avoid sitting in traffic:<br></ul><br><br>Driving style:<br><ul><br>- Don't pump the gas pedal before starting your car.<br>- Make sure that your parking brake is fully released.<br>- Don't floor the pedal when accelerating from a stop.<br>- Conversely, brake gradually wherever possible.<br>- Don't ride the brake. Try for a smooth, constant speed.<br>- Don't exceed the speed limit. It wastes gas.<br>- If safe, turn off the car when idling more than 30 seconds.<br></ul><br><br>Maintenance<br><ul><br>- Keep your tires properly inflated.<br>- Replace worn tires.<br>- Get regular tune-ups.<br>- Get regular oil changes per your owner's manual.<br>- At the same time, check your air and fuel filters.<br>- Make sure your gas cap fits tightly.<br>- Keep your transmission fluid at the proper level.<br>- See a mechanic if smoke is coming from your tailpipe.<br>- Fix a slipping transmission immediately.<br></ul></div></blockquote>To add to the list,<br><br>1) Travel within the stipulated speed limit (50km/h on the normal streets). This minimises wind drag, and also optimises fuel consumption based on the low rpm. (You will see even the trucks overtaking you)<br><br>2) Accelerate like a snail whne the light turns green and try to stick within 2000rpm. You are going to get high beamed and horned from behind, but what the heck... so long as you save fuel.<br><br></div>

Let any opponent 'jio' u on the road, u just be your usual self. If u challenge him, u are making him happy because he got his motive liao.

Yes there are 1/8 scale gas car capable of 0-100 in less than 2 seconds, top speed is around 130-140 km/hr. The better ones are Serpent, Mugen, Neo and PICCO. I used to play with these....wickedly fast little things. But they are not cheap.....for a decent race set-up, be prepared to blow about $2000 per car. For one weekend run, expect to spend $60 on tyres and $30 on fuel. It is quite an expensive hobby......play with real car better leh.</div>
