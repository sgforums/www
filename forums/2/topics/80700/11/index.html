Four of us, good bargainers, including a car enthusiast, "grilled" the SA for about an hour before he gave us the car alarm and reverse sensor.  I even failed to get free petrol vouchers.  Now that everything is more or less confirmed with the COE obtained, I doubt he will let us squeeze him for more freebies.  Moreover, a lot a exposure in the media about the Kia Picanto has gathered a lot of interest in the car.  A queue has formed and even those who booked their car earlier has not gotten it yet.  Dun know why we have to queue for anything or everything in Singapore.  It's not like we are queuing for something free, mind you.  Buy a car also have a queue for 2 to 3 months.  Really sian, man.  I only hope the car will live up to all our expectations.</div>

And consumers like ourselves end up paying out-of-this-world prices for such a basic car.<br><br>Downunder in OZ or USA, S$54K (Price of Picanto auto in S'pore) gets you 3.8l Ford Falcon for your drive to work on weekdays, a topless Corvette for those Friday night and weekend flings, plus a 2l Suzuki Vitara for those off holiday road road trips... &amp; still with $$$ change $$$ to spare.<br><br>Car buyers in Singapoe should be awarded a "Loyal Citizen" title, as they add tonnes of money into the govt's coffers.<br></div>

Singapore govt also knew long ago that the rising car population is a problem cannot be solved.

Anyway, if I am going to spent this kind of money on a car, I will make sure that the car create convenience for me. What for to scrimp and save? Might as well dun buy a car in the first place, right?  I dun want to get a car but end up waking up much earlier than usual to avoid the ERP charges. That will defeat the whole purpose. But having said so, of course I won't purposely be stupid and pay more than I should. If there is free or lower parking fees, I will take them of course.  No choice lah, Singapore is such a FINE city whahhhtt.  The moment you step out of the house, it costs $$$$.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to do a head count, how many of you have driven off your Pica.  Is it that the first batch left only black?  Anyone with other colour?  Those with first batch, is it true that the bumper colour is different from that of the body.  Seems that bumper was sprayed locally.  Was told that only first batch has no central locking.  How true?  For those already driving, how long did C&amp;C take to do up your accessories like reverse, alarm, etc.  Please share your driving experience.  Thanks.</div>

So all dun have but i change my $300 shopping vourcher to central locking, alarm &amp; reverse sensor.  I'd tried to squeeze for spoiler but failed.  U consider lucky coz u still got an ipod!
