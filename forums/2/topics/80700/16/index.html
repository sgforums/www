Perhaps stick to 13" tyre and buy a set of white hud caps. If get too dirty change.</div>

Btw your car will come with Rike cool right ? Don't tell me you want to tell our SA that you don't want the Rike cool and want to install it by your own. If like tat I also opt out my $3000 of luxury package. Then I can do my own leather seat, reverse sensor and central lock with alarm on my own. That at least cheaper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi see fu, actually i really 12 do that but our sa told me that he had submit my booking form already that y i cant change my package thaere for he told me that i can trade my petrol vouc to him and he will come out $80 for me which i thing he earn the $80 rether than paying for me,as for the tyres is cheap cos i did a survey if i get a wss rim plus a yokohama tyres the lease is abt $600+ - so i felt the price is still reasonable.<br><br>As for car alarm i felt is expansive,but he told me that due to this car need to install a rod in it and then can activate the 5 door car alarm system and as what he told u he also say the same to me he say they need to drill holes at the rear in order to make the 5door alarm sys, so workmanship is more expansive as for other car model $250 can make it, but for this car it is $380 for 5door and 4 door is $300 ($80 for installation of the rod).<br><br>tyres i might change from them but stil considering the central lock..<br>can anyone give some sugesstion to me</div>
