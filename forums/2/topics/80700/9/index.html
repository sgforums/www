Why do I say so?  I booked my blue diamond picanto end May 2004 and successfully got my COE today! Mind you, this is the first bid and I got it!!! Furthermore, my car is supposed to come in September.  There are altogether 6 bids and you are sure to get the COE sooner or later.  I told myself not to be too anxious or desperate in getting the car.  If I get it, fine, if not, forget it. I told my SA plainly and firmly that I will rather give up the car than pay anything additional. That's why I think he did his best in assisting me in getting the COE.  Perhaps a previous posting by my friend Vit4WD will explain everything clearly, read on the copied posting:<br><br>You are being mislead that C&amp;C does not make much from the Picanto sales.<br><br>I did my sums and calculated, that based on COE prices at S$28,000, C&amp;C still makes between S$5,000 to S$7,000 profit for every Picanto sold.<br><br>Please remember that the OMV of the Picanto is very low.

            <div class='col-md body'>My dear so-call Thai hero,<br>There are many features tat a K-car have and J-car doesn't. I believe tat K-cars are more 'solid' to the new generation J-cars. Maybe you want to try and use your J-car(if U have) to try and knock on my K-car. I think this place is for interested korean cars present and future owners. Just quickly find a home,  get in there and comes out when Singapore holds an Olympic/world cup. BTW, if u want junk, look into the mirror.<br></div>
