They initially increased it by $1,000 and then went on to $2,000. Why did they do that? The increased COE gave them more reason to increase the price they mentioned earlier. That's what they mean by early "bird catch the worm".<br><br>I do not mean any offence, however I am pretty sure that C&amp;C-KIA will not back down and decrease the price at this point of time or any time soon. They might do so when of the same kind new model launches (just like what they are doing to the Rio now; don't quote me for this though).<br><br>As for the shipment, that's something they cannot control.<br><br>I do not know anything about the preivous KIA distributor/s however C&amp;C-KIA has a reputation to maintance, so don't worry. The only thing we can do is wait; like many have said, the sales executives would love to close the deal too.<br><br>Others might have more to add to this... feel free<br><br>Vincent</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Vit4WD:</div><div class="quote_body">Did you all know that the picanto price has increaed by S$2,000 (S$1,000 each time) since its launch, both times when COE increased (by less than S$1,000).<br><br>Since then, COE prices have dipped by S$500 each time on the 23 June &amp; 7 July biding, and by S$700 on the 21 July bid.<br><br>That means COE prices has gone down by S$1,700, so effectively, the Picanto price should have dropped by at least S$1,700, or back to the launch prices of S$49,999 for manual and S$52,999 for auto.<br><br>But C&amp;C is taking that "act blur" approach &amp; not reducing prices. With such huge profit margins now that COE prices have gone down, they are NOT :<br><br>1) Delivering the cars on time to those who have secured COEs<br>2) Bidding very low and NOT securing COE for those have booked their cars 2 months ago (probably another sales gimmic to have you buyers top up)<br><br>I hope history is not repeating itself like the what happened to the previous KIA distributor who failed to deliver the cars and ran off with customers' deposits.<br><br></div></blockquote>Wah lau, Kia Picanto has dropped to its original prices due to the falling prices of COE.  I have booked my car at 1K more, man!!!  Frankly, if I have gotten my car, I would not have mind the fluctuations in the prices, but it like while waiting it out, you see the price going up and down like the share market.  For me, I can still force myself to swallow the bitter pill.  What about those who booked at S$2,000 more?  Siannn, heart-pain, man.<br><br>Think I might be going down to C&amp;C Lengkee showroom this Saturday (31 July 2004) at between 2pm to 4pm to get a black and white confirmation on the arrival of my Picanto.  At first when I booked, I was told delivery was between early to mid September.  Then it became mid to end September.  Latest heard from my SA is that delivery in early October!!!  What is this, man?  Happy, happy changed the delivery date!!  Might as well tell me delivery in Christmas or better still Chinese New Year!!!  Really dampen my enthusiasm.  I dun mind waiting, but when the delivery dates keep changing, can get really pissed off.  If they really confirm in black and white on the delivery date and still can't deliver, I will take back my deposit and book another car, maybe a Getz or Vios, whatever, better than waiting like a beggar.  Anyway, Getz prices has dropped also.  If you noticed, there is no more advertisements on the Picanto in the newspapers or TV commercials anymore.  Just last Saturday, they took out a half page advertisement in The Straits Times Classified and only advertised on 4 four car model.  No Picanto at all.  Sounds fishy.  OK, this coming Saturday at Lengkeng showroom.  Who's keen? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

However, in the last month it's been in the repair shop 5 times and I've had over $1000 in repairs done (the cars is barely 2 years old!). I've had the alternator ($236), the battery ($70), the idle motor/throttle assembly ($687), and the pcm (the main computer that controls everything - luckily this was covered under warranty) replaced. I also had to take it to a mechanic who specialized in electrical problems so he could make sure that the Kia dealership I took the car to didn't mess anything up ($65). Aside from these recent repairs, I have also had to replace all four tires ($280), another battery ($60), the PC valve ($55), and I've had assorted repairs done that were covered under warranty. Part of the problem this last month could have been with the Sante Fe Dodge/Kia dealership, but a Kia repair shop should know how to fix it's own cars. I've done some checking around and having to do this many repairs does not seem to be anything out of the ordinary for Kia cars. I've talked to several repair shops and have been told that Kias are good for about 1-2 years, after which time they start to fall apart. This car has left my fiance and me stranded on the highway 4 times in the last month. Once it almost cost my fiancee her life (the car died at night on a 2 lane highway with no shoulder and she had no power at all - she couldn't even turn on the hazzard lights) Buying this car has been the worst mistake of my life, and I want to prevent other people from making the same mistake. If you are planning on buying a Kia, please read some of the many bad reviews and horror stories that I have found on the internet. To read some of the many reviews that other unsatisfied Kia owners have emailed me (sorry, but I am no longer accepting or posting anymore emails), click here. Most of these reviews make the problems with my Kia seem very minor.<br><br>Update (3/25/2000): A week after I finally got my car back, the brand new battery the dealership had put in died and needed to be replaced (leaving me stranded for a 5th time!). The dealership told me that they have been having problems with Kia batteries. The idle is also acting funny again, just like before it stranded us for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th times. It seems my ordeal with this car is never going to end!<br><br>Update (5/26/2000): I was contacted by a law clerk today looking for anyone who may have had problems with seat-back failures. She is working on a case where a 12 year old girl was severely disfigured when the driver's side seat-back reclining system failed during a rear end collision and hit her in the head, breaking every bone in her face. Click here to read the email that she sent me. If you have any information that she might find helpful, please email her.<br><br>This page has been viewed  times since 3/18/2000.<br><br>Read some of the many emails I have receivedEmails - page 1Emails - page 2Emails - page 3Emails - page 4Emails - page 5Emails - page 6Emails - page 7<br><br><a href="http://members.tripod.com/aiki_joe/i_hate_kia/" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/aiki_joe/i_hate_kia/</a></div>
