They might be gimmicks. Might be normal plastic sheets similar to those people paste on glass window with design. Unless they have certification like vcool, else, its just buying without knowing whether its real and in the end, its only xin1 li3 zuo4 yong4. For me, I will only spend money on such films after I got all my other accessories. Bcos this is something which you paid a lot, but get minimal in return. If spend money on a good ICE system, at least can hear the nice and clear music.<br></div></blockquote>Yah...maybe it's true in a way.....that' y hv to find somebody who has installed and personally experience it...<br></div>

Congratulations on getting your ride.  Do update us on the experience and joys of driving your Picanto.  BTW, is yours from the 2nd shipment?  Where did you collect it from?  Any procedures?  Your Picanto manual or auto?  What colour?  Sorry for the so many questions.  Perhaps you could post some pictures of the exterior and interior of the car to show us. We will sure appreciate that.  Thanks a lot! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>My 'baby' is auto, black.  Think should be first shipment as no central lock. The engine is really quiet.  As still run-in, had not really floor the accelerator but travelling up to 100kmh on highway is definitely no hassle.  Overall, performance quite satisfactory.  Most importantly, tis car really looks cool.  Only slightly shorter than saloon car but the width pretty similar.  Steering also quite comfort and aircon &amp; audio up to expectation.  Only bad thing is: pick up on slope slightly slower (guess manual will not have such trouble).  Hope you guys dun get too down.  I also waited from May till end Jul.  Will try to snap some shots of my pica to post.</div>

Only seen from website b4. But thats not important to me bcos I am tall enuf for the steering to be in that position, no adjustment needed.<br><br>Yah true, all dun have central lock and alarm. These two are to be installed separately on request. Central lock piston cost 20 each, need 4 so abt 80 bucks. Alarm also abt less than 100. Total of these 2 is 200. But most SA give free.</div>
