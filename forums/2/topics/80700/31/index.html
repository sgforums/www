            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone, by the way, I happened to see a Mr Roy (looks about 50+ years old) last Sunday while at Autobac.  His car plate starts with SFJXXXXD.  Guess most of us would probably be SFL, SFM, or SFN.  Chatted with him for a while and he was kind enough to show me the interior of his Picanto.  He has his Galaxy Black picanto for about 2 months now.  He claims to be the 1st person to collect the picanto in Singapore.  Told me that in the 1st shipment, C&amp;C juz brought in 8 cars.  He got his Picanto by chance as his son has bought a Rio, and C&amp;C sent him the brochure for the Pica.  Roy went down, liked it and bought it.  For the Kenwood hifi, he told me that his car has only 2 speakers and for fuel, he is using 95 though he was told 92 would be sufficient.  No need to go for 98.<br><br>As he was busy, did not chat for too long.  Thought I would share the info with all of you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Since you have driven your Picanto for over a month, how is the fuel comsumption in reality?  Is it really as good as it is told?<br><br>Everyone, by the way, I happened to see a Mr Roy (looks about 50+ years old) last Sunday while at Autobac.  His car plate starts with SFJXXXXD.  Guess most of us would probably be SFL, SFM, or SFN.  Chatted with him for a while and he was kind enough to show me the interior of his Picanto.  He has his Galaxy Black picanto for about 2 months now.  He claims to be the 1st person to collect the picanto in Singapore.  Told me that in the 1st shipment, C&amp;C juz brought in 8 cars.  He got his Picanto by chance as his son has bought a Rio, and C&amp;C sent him the brochure for the Pica.  Roy went down, liked it and bought it.  For the Kenwood hifi, he told me that his car has only 2 speakers and for fuel, he is using 95 though he was told 92 would be sufficient.  No need to go for 98.<br><br>As he was busy, did not chat for too long.  Thought I would share the info with all of you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Thanks pupakia for the info. Seems like a good testimony you have provided us with. With fuel 92, i think would save us quite a sum of money in long run.</div>

It is after all a new car.  Roy is using 95 for it also.  Maybe, you could consider it also. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Saw Carrfour selling.....</div></blockquote>As far as I understand, blind spot mirrors are usually attached to the left and right side mirrors.  What I meant is the rear view mirror inside your car which enables one to observe what is directly behind.  Usually, the clip-on mirror is longer and wider than the existing car mirror.  It allows the driver to see the traffic behind him from a wider and broader perspective.  I saw the 270mm and 300mm mirror at Autobac.  Since the picanto is a small car, I bought the 270mm mirror. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
