            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Vinsanne:</div><div class="quote_body">Worth? In my opinion, it's what you can afford, how you are going to use the car and can you live with a korean car. Who does not want to own a japanese or even european car (in Singapore), but the price difference is just too great. I wanted so bad to get the Honda Fit or Jazz... but the difference of more than $25,000 is just too much for me to bear. (I believe I will end up spending more money if I did get a Fit/Jazz. Yes, larger rims definitely... FC will go down though many have told me Fit/Jazz should have even better FC than Picanto (before they up the rims), after the rims... I would want more) So getting a basic car makes senses, stay basic.<br><br>My uncle whom I recently brought the whole family out comments were: "I don't think the car can go up to the carpark (including me the driver, three adults and three kids), and also highway, you better stay on the left lane". That's before we set off.<br><br>This were his comments when I was parking our Picanto on the third storey of a carpark: "The korean makers are really picking up. I cannot believe at 1.1litre, the car is still as powerful yet smooth and quiet".<br><br>He also warned me to drive the car with ease, as it's afterall only a 1.1litre engine. I think the engine will stay healthy if you don't drag over 3,500rpm (that's over 120km/hr). This one, i totally agree with him. If you over rev a small engine, the engine will not be as smooth and quiet anymore.<br><br>My final conclusion for Picanto. Basic car that is very worth for money, even if you bought it at $3k more, you will ultimately save money in the long run as the fuel consumption is good... forget to mention, driving the car with ease should see the car achieve over 18km/litre after the first few services. Very urban driving should still get you over 14km/litre on a Picanto.<br><br>Vincent<br></div></blockquote>Thanks a lot Vincent. Really informative things you have mentioned to me. As my family are pretty big sized I guess should be alright to get this car. The most worry thing is the fuel consumption as I have to travel from Sengkang to Clementi to study. Hee..So thats why need a more affordable car and the most important is less in FC. Thanksa  lot. Hee... Overall I guess you provide me with a great information. However, is the engine noisy? Because I went to test drive the Kelisa and find that very nosiy so it stops me from ordering one. I have seen a couple Picanto over the weekend on the road and my mother commented that it is very nice so do my other family members. I guess I needed more of performance than the outlook.

He has seen my agony and frustration.  You must remember one thing.  We have nothing against the Picanto.  In fact, we think it is a great car.  Can you still remember my initial enthusiasm.  Well, the long wait has definitely dampen it, not to mention the extra money I have paid for booking early.  We are not trying to demoralise anyone here.  We juz want to share our experience and let them not raise their hopes too high.  I have given encouragement to frustrated people over &amp; over again. Check the initial postings, you were not even here yet.  By letting the Picanto enthusiasts know, we hope to lower their hopes of a quick delivery, and thereby cushioning their disappointment.  If any new buyer does not need the car soon and they can wait, by all mean, get the Picanto.  I would applaude their decision.  People are starting to get pissed off becos of the waiting time, for example, RELAXMAN and astroken, who has paid an extra 3K just for booking the car early. Ha, can you imagine that?  The Picanto is worth the wait, provided the wait is not too long to pissed people off. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>And Vit4WD, I think you and I need to shut up.  Not everyone appreciates your "meaningless" comments.  Seems like you are more of a troublemaker.
