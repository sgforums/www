Just been to the forum on autoworld.com.my, one guy from Singapore said his SA just call him saying that this coming shipment(second shipment) only consist of Pica with black, white and cobalt blue.Diamond blue will be in Aug. And the SA from my friend as previously I have post the info from him that those colors in the first row in the brochure will arrive first. Wa lau, now I am confuse.<br>According to my SA about 400 to 500 Pica sold so far.<br>IF as what you said collect the car on same day, that will be a big day for us. But I think we might bounce to some of us in this forum on the day of collection<br></div>

Outside no doubts is cheaper but they r not familiar with ur car coz it's still new.  They'll some how less tighten some screws or might break ur door panel coz they do not know where to dismantle excatly (i kena once on my previous new car, heart pain <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ).  Yet done in C&amp;C can claim their warranty if any thing goes wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Juz a reminder Pica doesn't come wif centre locking that means u still gotta install the pistons for ur doors.  I think outside also around the same $$ la.  If u want cheaper u may go JB as the $ there is aournd RM190.</div>

DBS is cash rebate on total interest......I took DBS coz it's more cost-saving....as mine is an OPC, my loan amt is not that high, so I'll give maybank a miss...</div>
