Why do I say so?  I booked my blue diamond picanto end May 2004 and successfully got my COE today! Mind you, this is the first bid and I got it!!!

I told myself not to be too anxious or desperate in getting the car.  If I get it, fine, if not, forget it. I told my SA plainly and firmly that I will rather give up the car than pay anything additional. That's why I think he did his best in assisting me in getting the COE.  Perhaps a previous posting by my friend Vit4WD will explain everything clearly, read on the copied posting:<br><br>You are being mislead that C&amp;C does not make much from the Picanto sales.<br><br>I did my sums and calculated, that based on COE prices at S$28,000, C&amp;C still makes between S$5,000 to S$7,000 profit for every Picanto sold.<br><br>Please remember that the OMV of the Picanto is very low. Only S$6,000<br><br>Whatever the case, please DO NOT top up the extra S$1,500 for guaranteed COE.

They have been in this busines for decades. They have the margin to secure your COE, even if it rises above S$30K<br><br>The only issue is that it eats into their profit levels, so they wil try some tricks to get you to top up.<br><br>At the end of the day, if C&amp;C does not secure your COE, they make no money out of you, but if they secure your COE, they can still make some money out of this sale.<br><br>And also, if C&amp;C cannot hit KIA Korea's sales targets, they wil be taken off the KIA dealership in S'pore.<br><br>So please relax. You can get your car without any top ups.<br><br>Everyone got the picture here?  The more you gian (desire) it, all the more the SA will play on that aspect and you may get your COE later.

Browsed the Kia website but it does not seem very clear. But I think it will be a very nice colour; just a feeling.  Anyway, I got the colour partly  becos it should be easier to maintain.  It will not be immediately visible if the car gets dusty or dirty, when I am lazy to wash the car, hee hee.<br><br>Kinkichong, I think we have not much bargaining power now, since everything is more or less confirmed.  That is why when I bought the Picanto at Kia's showroom, I squeeze the SA and got the car alarm and reverse sensor.  I even wanted to push further for some petrol vouchers but the SA says that he has given everything he could.  If I still insist, he will dip into his commission and buy me the petrol vouchers.  Not wanting to put him in a spot, I did not press him further.<br><br>By the way, can I check if the car alarm and central locking the same thing??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kinkichong, don't be too upset...  I am in the same boat as you.  I only managed to get a price reduction of $300 and nothing else..<br>At least I'v learnt a lesson...  i.e.  if you know that there is no parallel import for a particular model car, never buy from the main distributor.  You can always get a better deal elsewhere.<br></div>

You have saved S$1,500 already.  Think of how you can use it for other things.  Regarding the car alarm, I think your SA bullshitting you.  My SA told me the car alarm is about S$200 and rear sensor is about S$200.  I heard you can get the car alarm done outside for as low as S$90 provided you have the lobang. But anyway, not so bad since you have the S$100 petrol voucher.  I think your SA must be very sian that you decide to opt for "non-guaranteed" COE, right?</div>

When I book the Picanto, my SA told me that they are bringing in all the colours on the brochure, and I will definitely have any colour I choose.  Everyone, dun ever let the SA use the "hang up and sell" (diao ki lai buay) attitude on you.  Remember, they are more eager than you.  If you dun buy, they dun earn their commission and have to "eat northwest wind".  Anyway, there were 4 of us around when I booked the Picanto. We have test-driven and done our homework for quite some time on other cars, and one of my friend, Vit4WD, is an experienced car enthusiast, so the SA knows that he cannot "xiao-xiao" and smoke us.  Anyway, my SA is quite a sincere, friendly, helpful and efficient person.</div>

Nevermind lah, we can use our experience in this to help those who are interested in buying the Picanto.  See, you are now a Si-Fu also, haha.  BTW, when did you booked your car? Have you ever seen a blue diamond Picanto before?  I booked mine end May 2004, also blue diamond, based on gut feeling cos brochure colour not very clear.</div>

Wow, you so lucky, got the S$300 voucher in addition to the alarm and rev sensor. But anyway, I am contented.  The last time I went, they did not have blue diamond. You mean now blue diamond is on display, maybe should go and take a look.</div>

One of them called his SA and cancelled the S$1,500 "guarantee COE" thing. Lucky he did so, if not wasted.</div>
