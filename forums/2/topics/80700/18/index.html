Just ordered one yesterday at IMM for $56,999.  Suppose to get $5k free (1st yr insurance &amp; 6th mth instalment) but must pay $150 (lower instalment scheme) per month for 9 months.  After reading all the postings, I managed to get the reverse sensor but still nego for other items but now waiting for my SA to contact me as he was busy with customer.   Can you ppl tell me what to squeeze from my SA wen he call.  He told me not to change to leather seat cause it may get scratch with the folding and unfolding function.  Is it true? Got $288 lucky dip and ipod.</div></blockquote>hmm...can try getting petrol vouchers..and car alarm w/ central lock...getting free leather seats is almost imposs judging from wat we all got here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

The 1.3M is going for only S$53K. The Picanto 1.1M retails for S$52K.<br><br>For an extra S$1K, you get a more powerful 1.3l tested &amp; proven Mitsubishi engine, plus a HUGE boot &amp; loads of interior space. And no worries about spare parts - lots of them up North.<br><br>All that talk about Protons being unreliable are untrue. More likely some competitors trying to tarnish Proton's image. I have personally rented the Wira 1.3M several times and trashed it real hard. It held its worth. I also have friends who own the Wira and they have no regrets or complaints.<br><br></div>

Think about it, a 1.3 manual Rio cost about S$2,500 than a manual Picanto. You yourself has said it, bigger boot capacity, more powerful engine. I saw a black Rio the other nite at Downtowneast Pasir Ris. Enhanced with at least a spoiler and sport rims, it's really a beauty. Also, can get the car earlier, dun have to wait until my "neck long". But then again, the Picanto has a newer engine and its really cute and stylish, and most importantly, we will be one of the first batches to own it in Singapore.  The model is something new and has all the hype to it. This feeling is really shiok. This is my personal opinion. Think about it. Quite a difficult choice, really. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
