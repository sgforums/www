            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ford Focus Â“EatsÂ” Cerato</strong><br><br>I test drove the Cerato auto today and was directly behind a test drive Ford Focus at a traffic light junction, waiting to turn right<br><br>When the arrow turned green, the Ford Focus blasted off like a F16. I floored the accelerator with all my might but the Focus looked like a speck of dust miles ahead. Soon, I lost sight of it, until I came to a halt at the next traffic light junction, side by side this German marque.<br><br>With OD (overdrive) turned off, hands firm on the steering wheel, and adrenaline rushing down my blood, my face flushed, my heart pumping at thrice the speed of lighting, I could feel the sweat glands on both my palm working at full load as I focused on the tarmac ahead, and turned to glance at my rival (aka Jackie ChanÂ’s Â“ThunderboltÂ” style).<br><br>As we waited for the lights to turn green, the seconds seemed like hours. The green wave finally came, in Daytona-like fashion. VVRROOOOOOMMMMM !!!!! Off screamed the Focus. I did not stand a chance at all. For once, I though I was behind the wheels of a Picanto. Flabbergasted, I downshifted to Â‘LÂ’, and as the coarse Korean workhorse started to protest in anger, I thought Â“I am finally <strong>Killed In Action</strong>Â” (KIA).<br><br>While the heavy Cerato tops the scales at 1275kg, and is sluggish in pick up, I could not believe that it could lag that far behind, not even if the Focus were a manual version - unless the Focus had a NOS in the boot.<br></div>
