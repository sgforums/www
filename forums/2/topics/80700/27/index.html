But my SA cannot tell me definitely when is the delivery.  He simplyshut me off by saying 'same as what I told you before lor'.  When I reminded him that he has told me '25 Jul shipment', he said 'yah, around there'.  What kind of attitude is this?<br><br>Fortunately, we are not in a hurry to get a car.

Changing to a broader tyre will NOT prevent skidding.<br><br>My Vitara, using 205/70R15 tyres, Made in France Michelin Pilot MXV3A (no ABS) also faces the same problem. I was travelling at about 40km/h on a straight road when I approached a hump and applied hard pressure on the brakes. The wheels locked.<br><br>In contrast, my Corolla (with ABS), using thinner 175/70R14 stock tyres (Yokohama) has never skidded nor has the wheels locked when I tried jamming the brakes on the highway at 80km/h (with no cars behind me of course).<br><br>It is the ABS that prevents skidding, not the tyres.</div></blockquote>abs helps to prevent wheel locking. my opionion is, given two similar cars with abs, one with 155mm tyres, another with 205mm tyres, stopping distance for the latter will be better.<br><br>i wonder if a Mercedes SLK will skid on 155mm tyres when e-braking from 80kmph.</div>
