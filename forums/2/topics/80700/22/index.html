Just a $300 petrol voucher that they are suppose to give and a $300 petrol voucher from the lucky draw. All these on Roadshow at Century Square.

Well, they are quite different compared to Ultrashield. "V-Shield is a glossy, clear, self-adhesive polyurethane plastic film, laser-cut to fit your car's shape exactly, it goes on top of the critical impact surface areas of your car such as the front bumper, headlights, grille and bonnet. It is not a wax or polish." (www.v-shield.netfirms.com)<br><br>However, V-shield only protect the "critical impact surface areas". That means, your top (roof), sides (doors) and back (boot door) will not be protected.<br><br>Ultrashield is wax and polish! They give you a package of one shield protection on your first polish (I suppose, it's a very strong layer of polish), and follow by five maintenance polishes. To do a job like this, proper wax, equipments and most importantly; the skills required will be critical. And remember, by buying a maintenance package, you have a period of up to 18 months to use your polishes. The rest of the time, you just need to rinse, shampoo then rinse your car again. Quick and easy.<br><br>In Singapore, time is money <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The UltraShield promotion is on July 10(Sat) - July 11(Sun), as quoted from SGKIACLUB FOR SALE forum.

Well, they are quite different compared to Ultrashield. "V-Shield is a glossy, clear, self-adhesive polyurethane plastic film, laser-cut to fit your car's shape exactly, it goes on top of the critical impact surface areas of your car such as the front bumper, headlights, grille and bonnet. It is not a wax or polish." (www.v-shield.netfirms.com)<br><br>However, V-shield only protect the "critical impact surface areas". That means, your top (roof), sides (doors) and back (boot door) will not be protected.<br><br>Ultrashield is wax and polish! They give you a package of one shield protection on your first polish (I suppose, it's a very strong layer of polish), and follow by five maintenance polishes. To do a job like this, proper wax, equipments and most importantly; the skills required will be critical. And remember, by buying a maintenance package, you have a period of up to 18 months to use your polishes. The rest of the time, you just need to rinse, shampoo then rinse your car again. Quick and easy.<br><br>In Singapore, time is money <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The UltraShield promotion is on July 10(Sat) - July 11(Sun), as quoted from SGKIACLUB FOR SALE forum.

If i have to choose one, definitely will take up the Ultrashield. However, I understand Vshield will ultimately protects better in terms of pebbles when driving.</div>
