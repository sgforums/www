All modern automatic gearboxes are designed to cope with this, so there is no unnecessary wear and tear on the mechanical components.<br><br>Frequently shifting from D to N and vice versa, however, puts strain on the gearbox and its electronically controlled solenoids. In the long run, this may result in premature failure of some components, and a hefty repair bill. ItÂ’s also a common misconception that holding the car with the brakes leads to additional wear and tear on the braking parts.

Only the current facelifted model comes with stock 175/70R13 tyres</div></blockquote>Hi Vit4WD,<br><br>Yes, changing to wider tyres casues higher fuel consumption. I know that we are not driving that fast on Singapore roads. However, I personally have experience of skidding on wet roads even at 30km/h with 155mm wide tyres. I've since changed to 195mm tyres. Grip is definitely much better, even on wet weathers. Of course, I dont mean that after changing to wider tyres, anyone should try to push the limits further. Driving safely is still the ultimate goal in the list.<br><br>As for my Accent, the stock is 155/80R13. Unless Komoco motors gave me the wrong tyres when i collect my car, else, i pretty sure that it is not 155/70R13.<br><br>Now I'm on 195/50R15. Fuel consumption is slightly more. Won't feel much difference in the consumption when travelling on North South Highway.<br><br>In my own opinion, slight increase in operating cost is worth the great safety i got in return.<br><br>You are right about the primary reason for choosing Picanto. Perhaps shouldnt consider 15" as an option. It may be too much a burden for the 1.1l engine. A fair compromise could be a 14"....<br><br>Once again, all these are my personal experience and opinion. Just wanna share with people who are interested here. I come from a very neutral stand. I'm not into persuading anyone to upgrade their rims. As I mentioned in my earlier post, everyone has different needs. They have to find a balance between both.<br></div>
