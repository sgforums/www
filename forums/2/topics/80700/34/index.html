            <div class='col-md body'>Free tips to improve mileage,<br><br>General hints:<br><ul><br>- Use a sunshade. A cooler car requires less air conditioning.<br>- For the same reason, park in the shade when it's warm.<br>- Roll down a window instead of using your air conditoner.<br>- Clear your car of junk. Extra weight uses up gas.<br>- Get an update before you leave to avoid sitting in traffic:<br></ul><br><br>Driving style:<br><ul><br>- Don't pump the gas pedal before starting your car.<br>- Make sure that your parking brake is fully released.<br>- Don't floor the pedal when accelerating from a stop.<br>- Conversely, brake gradually wherever possible.<br>- Don't ride the brake. Try for a smooth, constant speed.<br>- Don't exceed the speed limit. It wastes gas.<br>- If safe, turn off the car when idling more than 30 seconds.<br></ul><br><br>Maintenance<br><ul><br>- Keep your tires properly inflated.<br>- Replace worn tires.<br>- Get regular tune-ups.<br>- Get regular oil changes per your owner's manual.<br>- At the same time, check your air and fuel filters.<br>- Make sure your gas cap fits tightly.<br>- Keep your transmission fluid at the proper level.<br>- See a mechanic if smoke is coming from your tailpipe.<br>- Fix a slipping transmission immediately.<br></ul></div>

True tat Mit cars are good as I drove b4, but if it is driven by a monkey like driver who switch lanes like monkeys hopping from tree to tree, then I really pity the car. As mentioned earlier, that this section is for KIA owners (present and future), unless you never been to school and do not understand ENGLISH. True that we all suck(don't you suck milk).  If u need attention seeking, Mandai is the place. Wish U good luck on the road !!!</div>

So for those who are Anti Kia, Mit, Honda or Toyota.....Just stick to your own forum if u have and stop disturbing people. Like someone quoted, if one day someone goes to your forum and said that your car brand sucks and waste of money getting it, I think you will feel the same. True that we might not outrun the Lancer, but always remember that NOT EVERY DAY IS A SUNDAY. The world is round and everything will come back. After reading what Saab95 typed, certain things he says is true. Also I believe all of us in here are old enough to be parents &amp; also know how to think, if this goes on, there will be no end. If u think KIA sucks, ok it sucks but I am happy owning one for my daily use and not for speeding. Just remember what you type here as it might insult Hyundai owners too as both are the same company. Good luck on the road.</div>

What Pupakia says is true. It is actually directed at Mr Black, and also in a fit of anger. Truely I like Volve, Saab and Merc cars, I heard that the safety features is good for Saab, true? My neighbour in my office recently just scrape away his Volvo and change to a SAAB own by his wife(now his wife car less liao). BTW, from what I read you change from Getz to SAAB, why? I believe highly educated and rich people like you not only own 1 car right? hehe<br>But is maintaining it very high?</div></blockquote>Actually u are right, there is a Lexus and Camry in my family Garage but they are my dad's. The Saab I am supporting myself, that's why the GETZ had to go. Initially was thinking of passing it onto to my bro by he got a nice job (fat salary-cushy workpace)  in Canada....now he is eyeing the M3 ......LUCKY FELLA!<br><br>Yes maintainence can be an issue but with the right mechanic (only 2 in Singapore besides Tran-Eurokars) and a little knowledge on SAAB cars, it is not much worse than a Camry @ Borneo Motors....if anyone needs help or recommendation I will be glad to assist.<br><br>Y'NOT U test drive a SAAB.....experience it for yourself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Yes it is very well endowed in both active and passive features.....in short I feel very safe in it even at speeds well over 200KM/hr.....very stable and quiet. Engine is equipped with twin balancer shafts (very rare on 4cyl 2.0 litre engines), very smooth even at full bore....can lose liscense quite easily if never check speed.<br><br>Also, the car is easily modded to give even more searing performance  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>

True that we might not outrun the Lancer, but always remember that NOT EVERY DAY IS A SUNDAY. The world is round and everything will come back. After reading what Saab95 typed, certain things he says is true. Also I believe all of us in here are old enough to be parents &amp; also know how to think, if this goes on, there will be no end. If u think KIA sucks, ok it sucks but I am happy owning one for my daily use and not for speeding. Just remember what you type here as it might insult Hyundai owners too as both are the same company.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, speaking with regards to cars.....if I could have two wives (cars) then the first wife will be the SAAB and the mistress will be the Evo8....hahaha!<br><br>I am happy to note that most Evo drivers are responsible ppl who do not indulge in cheap thrills....after all no point in challenging with the knowledge that you will most definitely win anyways. Hope if indeed Mandrake owns an EVO8, he belongs to this group. Personally, I hate the boyracer types who like to smell my car's butt, sometimes I have this urge to slam on my brakes and guess wat SAAB against EVO....SAAB probably minor reconstruction, Evo8 very likely scrapped, EVO driver prob will never drive again.<br><br>See the point? Ever car has its good points. Sure, Evo8 faster than my SAAB but what about safety and build quality? Similarly EVO8 Versus KIA....at the end of the day....whose bank balance will look healthier if both parties have the same salary?<br><br>For our picanto friends I am sure they will appreciate the Evo8 for it's capability but what about practicality? When u have family committments, it is much more useful to have some cash surplus at hand. Insurance and FC for Evo8, very staggering even for me......not good when u consider that u can take ur family on a nice holiday on the premium alone.<br><br>It will be good if ppl can be more detailed and constructive in their comments. If u say a car is bad, why and what are your personal experiences with it. There should be an element of credibility to your statements.<br><br>Anyways I have test-driven a KIA RIO 1.5 (AUTO) last year for my friend. He wanted a simple car without too much sacrifice in performance, problem was he had not driven for more than 6 years, so had to get me to test-drive on his behalf. My impression of the car was a good one, the engine was above competent and handling was suprisingly good. Only beef I had was the odd cabin design and platicky feel....but then again it is a budget car!<br><br>With proper maintenance a late/new generation KIA can just be as reliable as those toyotas rolled out of BMS. Personally my favourite KIAs that I think are worth every $$$ spent are the new CERATO and SORENTO....masterpieces at mortal pricing.<br></div>
