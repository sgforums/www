What Vit4wd said is true, it is up to C&amp;C to settle themselves the problem. But one thing is that Singapore is not the affected country. Currently, Swenden has totally run out of stocks for Picanto. As for Cerato, it was done after the strike, so the stock is so called more than PICA. Now even in M'sia, stocks is running low too. When I collected my Picanto 2 months ago, my sales already told me that stocks will be running ourt soon.<br>As for some, it may be so happen that there is stock and also the colour of their choice when booking was done, thus was able to receive their car very soon, no matter what brand and model. So we must understand that it is not C&amp;C doesn't want to give you the car, but it is they don't have the car to give you. Also, Relaxman, where u book? I would suggest that you demand a B&amp;W from the office on the delivery date for the car and if not, they have to rent a car for you. Remember what 'Dodong' did for his CERATO. Or did they promise you earlier, but now they cannot delivered to you? If that is so, try to nbang table like some of them did and also at the same time, send a mwil to C&amp;C customer service letting them know about it. Try to be firece in the mail like treatening to withdraw....That provides you book from C&amp;C.But even you book from Fulco, feedback to C&amp;C on their service too,like empty promises.....</div>

We met the guy in M'sia who is the President(nick 'ManB') of Kia club last few weeks. He says that the Gen2 is not selling well as it is over priced in M'sia too. Also  there are cases where customers collected the car and noticed the paint work chip off at the power window switch. He also says that 1 Gen2 actually went into flame when owner was driving it for about a week only.<br><br>Happy Driving</div>

If bidding after the 6th attempt is unsuccessful, they might ask you to top-up cash to secure a COE.  If you refuse, they have to refund your deposit.  If your bank loan is not approved, they have to refund your deposit as well.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
