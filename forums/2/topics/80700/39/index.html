            <div class='col-md body'>Generally the same cc vehicle, auto should consume more than manual. But if versus a heavy footed drag racer drving a manual and a relax driver driving auto, guess maybe the manual consume more than auto. It depends a lot on how u drive.<br><br>Each person has different driving style. I belong to those relax and light footed type, so my fuel consumption regardless of riding bikes last time or driving different model of cars is always a lot lower than people riding or driving the same model as me.<br><br>This is tested and proven, my friend have the same car as me, I can go to 13km/liter, but his is 11km/liter, In the end, we swap car for one week, and guess what I still attain 13km/liter on his car and he still attain 11km/liter on my car. Our car is totally the same, no modification at all. So its a fair test. Of course u cannot compare 2 different cars or a moded car with non-moded car.<br><br>Auto is slower than manual is bcos auto version is heavier and manual one u have the option to drag gear and down gear when not enuf power.

I dunno whether you can get full loan amount or you need to pay at least an percentage upfront. My upfront amount is less than 10%. Here is an example.<br><br>KIA Picanto Manual $49,999<br><br>Upfront amount = 5% = $2500<br><br>Loan amount = $49,999 - $2500 = $ 47,499<br><br>For 10 years loan interest = $47,499 x 2.45% x 10 years = $11,637<br><br>Monthly installment = ($47,499+$11,637)/10years /12mth = $493<br><br>Monthly about $493, excluding pertrol, insurance, road tax etc<br></div>

Bcos they dont scare u run away, even if the first instalment after u got ur car never pay, they can tow back and sell away, still got lots of money left.<br><br>Overall, not worth to get 8,9 or 10 years loan. The interest is higher. If u intend to sell with few years, you have to top up money just to sell the car. Best is minimum 10-30% downpayment and 7 years loan. Anytime sell also wouldnt lose money one.</div>
