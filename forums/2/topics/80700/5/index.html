About the board luckily I make a deal with my SA if the car don't come with the board, he will give me $100 to make myself. As you said you SA order the board for you at $20+, if I get my Pica can ask your SA order one for me ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Kingfisher, according to JC5 at Jln Sultan (address at www.swog.com.sg) the visor  and rear spoiler cost about $120 to $180 each. Still not sure. If that is the case, the visor can get at Alexander. According to John at JC5, the visor cost about $120 (bit expensive). FYI, Pica air-con is very cold.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey requested by my kids, go down to C&amp;C to look at Pica again. Now there is only one car furthermore is a test car in Ubi. Have take a second look and check the cabin space, confirmed few things:<br>a. 3 persons of my size(1.72m,65kg) seating behind no problem.Please note that the 2 front seats adjusted to allow person of my size sit comfortably.<br>b. The rear mirror can tilt to shield the glaring light from car behind.<br>c.With the tray remove in the boot, the storage space is quite good.<br>And have talk to my SA, this time round they did not bid for me as the car is not in Singapore yet. According to him will be in in July and each shipment about 100 cars. Also he said the booking is quite good so far about 400 to 500 Pica has been booked. Some people have to collect their car as late as October. Is overwhelming !<br></div>

But can be following scenerio:<br>1. is the instalment for a weekend car OR<br>2. is the instalment after they deduct the DBS 20% rebate(if you get a DBS loan) that spread over first 12 months period. After that you pay full amount of the instalment.<br><br>More likely is the second scenerio.<br>[/b]</div>
