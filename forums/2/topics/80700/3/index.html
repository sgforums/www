So Thur can go jalan jalan see whether you can spot a pica on the road. My present car a Toyota corolla 1.3xli. Don't know is it because of my broquet that why cannot feel the effect of Magnefuel. Anyway both broquet and magnefuel will be transfer to my pica. Voltage stabilizer is to stabilize the battery voltage or in another word to ease out all the spike or sudden surge of current due to devices that drawing current in the car battery. Some guys used said have bright head light, hifi sound different, easy start of engine etc.</div>

But the intensivity of vibration depend also very much on the type of engine. For example 2 same 1L cars, one have a double overhead cam with 4 cylinders and 16 valves will be smoother and vibrate lesser than a single ovehead cam with 4 cylinders 12 valves engine. But if the single overhead cam 4 cylinders 12 valves engine compare to a double overhead cam 3 cylinders 12 valves engine, it may be vibrate lesser. I know of the kelisa vibrate very badly, cause I have test drive both the manual and auto. For auto kelisa I found even worse at idling.</div>

It's about Picanto being one of the most affordable car in its class, considering the fact that it's only 1.1litre. Of course we are not trying to compare it with cars out of this league. We definitely cannot compare this car to the Merc A Class which look somehow similar. We are also not comparing it to a 1.6litre Toyota that is definitely more powerful.

The UK verdict claim for highway driving... Picanto can easily hit 600km with 30litres of petrol, with 5 litre left as spare. As for singapore driving, fuel consumption is already hitting 16-18km/litre range by earlier bird owner Joseph. Not bad at all.<br><br>Once again, you can see Joseph's Picanto (2nd owner in Singapore) on the below link.<br><br><a href="http://pbase.com/caravincent_feb04" rel="nofollow">http://pbase.com/caravincent_feb04</a><br><br>Enjoy,<br>Vincent</div>

Some will be lower and some will be higher, "lia teng por tay" maybe can earn a bit. COE lower, you will buy the car at lower price and instalment will be lower. COE higher, your instalment wil be high. But come to early scraping of car can get more money. As the chinese saying "sheep fur grow on the sheep". They still can sell you at $49,999 if after calculation they still earn or else they will tell you to top up lor. End up you may have to pay 1k to 2k more for your car. Selling price will be $50,999 or $51,999, not quite worth.<br>By the way my SA did not call, so don't know did I get my COE. Anyone out there get his or her COE ?</div>

But got this SMS from my sales rep. this morning that, the bid was unsuccessful.<br><br>Here's some thinking...<br><br>If total price is $49,999 (FIXED)<br>COE being $28,790++<br>Car price is about $21,200++ ONLY (original car price in UK)<br><br>Will car dealer profit from the COE too? They then make less from the car price right? Higher COE better or lower COE better for buyer? Will they in turn say, they cannot sell the car at $49,999 to us anymore? Will they be increasing the total price (with COE) for the Kia Picanto in the end? Can they do that?<br><br>Vincent<br></div></blockquote>Hey Vin,<br><br>i believe the SA is going to ask u to top up for the next COE bid based on the hike or maybe have to wait for next bid...but judging from the trend, i dun see COE coming down... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Just curious, wat was the COE price they told u for the selling price of $49,999?? thats their reference....check with them and see wat u need to top up..or wait for the next bid..<br><br>Of cos COE lower better lah! lower COE = lower selling price! tats how car sales work...<br><br>but hor, got once when the COE went down, car dealers claimed that they did not increased price when the COE increased previously..so no reduction also when COE fell...JERKS!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I do not have a very good impression of car dealers or SA! sorry abt that.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Ben<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Pica friends,  Seen a lot of reviews, would like to know from those who got the first shipment.  Is it true no central lock, body colour different from the bumper (sprayed in S'pore)?  So far no one commented  on the power of the auto version.  Any comments?</div>

Manual will not give you any extra power but it is has more torque on the lower gears. The bonus for experienced manual drivers on the Picanto is; it's more fuel efficient.<br><br>Hope this helps</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the Picanto looks decent and reliable enough for basic transportation use.<br><br>However, I still have my concerns over its fuel consumption since it is after all, still a Korean-made car. I would very much like to compare it's fuel consumption with the Kelisa.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The FC chould be good cos ftom some of the european and malaysian forum most of them say that the fc is gd and for manual is abt 18-20km/l &amp; as for auto will be 14-16km/l.But some of the people say that if you fill it with magnefuel it will make the fc better by 20%.<br>i tested drive the auto it is ok but during the moving off of when then 1st gear going to shift to 2nd gear it is a bit slow in respond but after that it is fast n powerful.Although slow in moving off but when i get up slope with both my parents (84kg &amp; 78kg),the agent (abt 70kg),my wife(50kg)and me (77kg).can go up with up flooring the acc or changing to c2.drving wise very comfortable.If you 1 real power and torque take the manual cos it is better power than auto 1(for sure every car is like that).</div>
