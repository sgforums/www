In my opinion, it's what you can afford, how you are going to use the car and can you live with a korean car. Who does not want to own a japanese or even european car (in Singapore), but the price difference is just too great. I wanted so bad to get the Honda Fit or Jazz... but the difference of more than $25,000 is just too much for me to bear. (I believe I will end up spending more money if I did get a Fit/Jazz. Yes, larger rims definitely... FC will go down though many have told me Fit/Jazz should have even better FC than Picanto (before they up the rims), after the rims... I would want more) So getting a basic car makes senses, stay basic.<br><br>My uncle whom I recently brought the whole family out comments were: "I don't think the car can go up to the carpark (including me the driver, three adults and three kids), and also highway, you better stay on the left lane". That's before we set off.<br><br>This were his comments when I was parking our Picanto on the third storey of a carpark: "The korean makers are really picking up. I cannot believe at 1.1litre, the car is still as powerful yet smooth and quiet".<br><br>He also warned me to drive the car with ease, as it's afterall only a 1.1litre engine. I think the engine will stay healthy if you don't drag over 3,500rpm (that's over 120km/hr). This one, i totally agree with him. If you over rev a small engine, the engine will not be as smooth and quiet anymore.<br><br>My final conclusion for Picanto. Basic car that is very worth for money, even if you bought it at $3k more, you will ultimately save money in the long run as the fuel consumption is good... forget to mention, driving the car with ease should see the car achieve over 18km/litre after the first few services. Very urban driving should still get you over 14km/litre on a Picanto.<br><br>Vincent<br></div>
