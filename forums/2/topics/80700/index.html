Initially took up the AUTO Picanto, but later (monday) changed it to the MANUAL one.<br><br>After a test drive on both cars, I was furthered convinced by my desicion.<br><br>On the AUTO, I have to floor the pedal each time i want to over-take but it's not responsive enough.<br><br>On the MAUNAL, you can actually feel the torque!<br><br>I believe both cars will have pretty much the same fuel consumption, BUT... that means, you will have to drive the AUTO very conservatively (no flooring). A good MANUAL driver will be able to do very good mileage.<br><br>Anyway, I am surprise the shifting of the gears on the MANUAL are so easy on this budget car.<br><br>Enough said.

I got the $300 shopping voucher from the LuckyDraw. My sales rep. mentioned to me that i might be able to convert the shopping voucher to a reduced cash rebate (still pending).<br><br>I have checked with other car sales rep. from other competing brand.

Leather seat, are you kidding? It's close to $1,500, don't think they will be giving anyone for free. Anyway, the leather seat is way too expensive at $1.5k; stay with the original cushion for now and if you see the need for the leather, you can always find shops and get it done professionally.</div>

The AUTO car is not so bad if you are looking forward to ease of driving, and remember, the Picanto is a very basic car afterall.<br><br>Now, I realized once again why it's important to buy anything (example; insurance) from someone with knowledge and experience.<br><br>One more thing, on sunday at Century Square itself, I actually asked about full cash payment and to buy my own insurance. For these two requests, she mentioned there will be a surcharge of $2000 each. What is that mann! (my colleague later explained to me that, they do make some profit when we take up their in house loan and insurance).<br><br>Still, can anyone verify that?<br><br>Vincent</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Yes, for the sales person in car trade.<br>You decide right, they make.<br>You decide left, they make.<br>For the 2 you chose to opt out, they make nothing.<br>so you have to pay a panalty.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

When I was at the road show at Tampines, there seems to be only one tone for the seat but they do have the interior white color trims.<br><br>The RIMs... would someone tell me when they find a reasonable good looking and affordable one. But uping the size of the RIMs is going to hurt the fuel consumption bad?<br><br>As for the alarm, are you guys considering that comes with ignition system, where you can start the car remotely. My brother that drive a IST has it fitted for $300+. Will confirm the price again if anyone is interested.<br><br>Vincent</div>
