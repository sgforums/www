Before buying the Picanto, my wife and I did went around a few showrooms and carmarts, and always something made us hesitate.  We also went to C&amp;C Lengkee juz to looksee and we didn't forsee that we will book the car immediately.  Initially, we really were aiming for a Japanese car and did not have a strong liking for Korean cars. I guess it is a combination of factors that made us like to the Picanto. The spacious interior despite being a small car (the headroom is better than Rio), the competitive pricing, the stylish exterior, the ease of handling and most importantly the fuel consumption.  I guess comparatively, it is also cheaper to "maintain" the Picanto. I really think we made the right decision.</div>

At first, he seem reluctant to tell us, but relented after a bit of prompting. He really told the 4 of us there, so we could not have heard wrongly.  What I understand is that depending on which car brand dealer, the basic salary of an SA is very low, about S$300 to S$500 per month, so they really depend a lot on the commission.  For a pricey item such as a car, it is by no means easy to sell, unless it is extremely popular. I heard so far, about 500+ picantos were sold. S$100 to S$200+ seems very low leh.<br><br>My friend, Vit4WD, please comment on this if you see this reply.  I think you heard it also when the SA said S$400, right??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

My SA told me if C&amp;C is goona bring in the full accessories Pica (same like d UK version)  it'll cost around 65-70k liao, by that i think most of us will rather consider a jap car than this mini car rite? BTW did u watch d commercial this moment, it said even if u have all those high tech safety features, if u drive like mad it kills 2!  My dad's proton still running around fine even without ABS, SRS airbags.  The most important idea is, car is juz a tools for transport purposes. And Pica is a pretty affordable basic car that can bring u fr point A - point B, 'mai hiam liao'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
