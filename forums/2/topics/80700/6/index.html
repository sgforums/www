He too was told color does come into the picture for delivery of Pica. He tell me to look into the brochure on the 2 rows of different colors of Pica, His SA said those booked with the colors show on first rows will get first( as this july shipment, cars are with these colors). So I think those who booked a Manual, with the colors on first row will get first. congratulation.</div>
