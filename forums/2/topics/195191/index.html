            <div class='col-md body'>Nowadays I happy to get to point B from point A in one piece. Long time ago I crashed into the pillar at ECP just bfore the airport and the car flew 60 meters after hitting the wall about 10 feet up. (With My foot on the Car brakes jammed tight)<br><br>If I not wrong I hit the wall at about 150 to 160 kmph. This is the pillar supporting the connection across the ECP for planes to go over to the other side.<br><br>The cars bonnet was /\ shape. The engine touching the ground. The roof /\ shape. and the part that hit the wall, the roof almost touching the passenger seat (no passenger or 100% dead); the front car tyres no longer "straight up"  I " but "flat  _ " ; so the engine was almost touching the ground.<br><br>I went home in a cab and later went back to the car and one of the policemen who was there asked me: "You the driver?" Like he cannot believe I am still alive. Then he started to "scream" at me.<br><br>A frend called me and said she saw a smashed up car being towed away and it looked like my car, but since I am talking to her on the phone, it couldn't have been me because she is so sure the people in the car all dead or in a coma. I told her I was talking to her in hospital.<br><br>Some glass chips penetrated my skin in the face and hand and body and had to be taken out by the doctor. One of my molar teeth broke because at the point of impact I was biting so hard the molar tooth broke! My face smashed into the steering wheel and my lips was sore like hlel.<br><br>After the impact I blacked out and when I came to; the first thing I asked myself was, "Am I still alive?" or am I dead? Blood was everywhere, but not much. I was more shocked than happy to be still alive. I moved my limbs and nothing was broken.<br><br>I got out of the car and a few cars (it was about 5am) on the way to the airport slowed down to look at me waving my hands at them and drove on like they were looking at a ghost.<br><br>One taxi stopped and the woman inside wound down her window and was screaming in a histerical manner at me.<br><br>I think I must have looked very bad. The blood and the green coolent splashed all over me. The car had (an unused) heater system that channeled the radiator coolent inside the car and the pipe broke and splashed hot radiator coolent all over me.<br><br>hahhaha I am a good stoy teller aren't I? It is a true story. All the details are accurate. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I even lose to SBS bus.  Ask SEI better. Juz the "horse" on the car alone can kill that GLXi already. Later I can throw in a few ponies too.
