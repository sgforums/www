Only thing good about lancer is its space and handling. But manual Lancer and Vios, think there are still room to fight. Also, Lancer CVT is super noisy, unless you are the gentle driver.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, i got the same problem as you....argggg.......<br><br>Initially, i compare, toyota altis, toyota vios, lancer, city and sunny.<br>After much consideration, i think sunny too ahpek... try to see the car on the road, the front ok but the rear.. sigh... y can't they improve on that (so sunny out) but overall i think the interior not bad. Sit in my friend;s altis, warah..... the dash board bery boring and the rear sit my head kept banging on the roof and the car looks abit like for ahpek too. Then saw the city vtec, wow got disc brake for all wheels, but then the rear look strange too and the price like upper end of the 60k's range so now city oso out. Now left the vios and  the lancer.<br><br>Vios got all the things needed but the space... sigh..........<br>and lancer got all the nice appearance....<br><br>if i choose will go for lancer, true enough that someone said that you bought a car and every time u go near it, u r not proud and feel damn sian when looking at the ugly car. Lancer, i think is ok la.... the look is there, the F.C don;t think will save much from it (hm.. may b i am wrong), and after all u r driving a car to travel from point A to point B, need so much power  (Singapore cannot race la, unless u thinking of going malaysia and try then i dunno)?????<br><br>Just get what you like, F.C and power may not be that important but may be can improve next time. I may get a lancer, now consider manual or auto...... arrrgggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh............. once got bonus will go n try but wander when will the newer model coming out.....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by retroguy:</div><div class="quote_body">hi guys, create another topic with another headache...<br><br>My friends intro Vios to me saying FC is much better, cheaper, no problems, etc... better than Lancer...<br><br>Now my problem is that the body not as nice as Lancer, but everything alse about Vios is what i want to...

            <div class='col-md body'>i personally prefer the Vios, but if you have family liabilities then get the Lancer, the Lancer i would recommand the Manual ones , unless you are working in the city or go up north often then the auto one will be perfect to suit your needs ... the F/C wise is errrr how to say , cannot be compared to the Vios as per mention by some of our bros and sis here<br><br>The price range is also not so far off from each other, so make a decision wisely, even Vios might look boring, but there are some cosmatic you can do to it, ask Free4ever or Quek , they saw quite a few Vios this morning with nice and cool designs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Just my 2 cents contributions</div>
