              <p>if you rent monday - wednesday, i think not worth it. Cos you
              pay almost $ 50 - $ 60 per day, which amounts to $ 180 for three
              days. Might as well you take the car till Friday, and you only pay
              like $ 180, which is about $ 36 per day.</p>

              <p>hmmm cos i only need the car for mon-wed only, that's why.. monday-wednesday is 2days only (don't mistaken) they count as mon-tues (1day)..</p>
              <p><br>As you know rental car company sometime cannot be trust, if half way, the car breakdown while you are renting for 5days and you have only rent for 2days like tihs breakdown, no car will be replace want, am i right? From eazicarlease company..</p>

              <p>Can't really comment on that.. They used to provide free exchange, if the car breakdown. That was when I rented from them in Bendemeer, their first hideout.</p>

              <p>Rented a Verna from eazicarlease for their 5days package, the
              fifth day being this friday.<br> <br> Called the company at 1pm, and decided to get the fiat skydome
              5door,  as it was cheappp.</p>
              <p>Verbal agreement that i'm to arrive at their rental place at
              7pm. Upon arrival at about 630pm, they offered me the 3 door
              skydome instead, to which i agreed as the other guy needed it to
              fetch his family from the airport.<br> <br> They photocopy my IDs , check the car here and there, and as i was
              about to drive it of, they say got miscommunication/ poor
              scheduling and thus, they have to change the car again, now to a
              hyundai verna. Was kinda pissed with their service. Not organized
              at all.<br> <br> Had to pay a little more for the verna, and i was more than willing
              to drive off before they decide to change the car again.<br> <br> Car condition was pretty bad. The second door on the left side of
              the car cannot be open from the inside. Interior light not working.
              Hardcore scratches on all 4 corners of the car, which prolly is nt
              their fault, but still. .  . . Other than tad, no other issue
              ba.<br> <br> I guess its kinda worth it for the price im paying. $180 for monday
              to friday.<br> <br> but sian la, rent at 7.30pm on monday, gotta return by 5pm on
              friday, else $20per hour charged for being late.</p>

              <p>Hihi that time you say you rented for 5days package right? How was it? The last day you returned the car, did the company charge you any extra money? You went the big round or go the shotcut?</p>

              <p>Fiat Punto comes in either Manual, or Selespeed (Fiat's name for Tiptronic gear).</p>
              <p>But from what i know, Eazicarlease only have the Selespeed version of Punto.</p>
              <p>The good thing about punto is :</p>
              <p>4 airbags / 6 airbags</p>
              <p>Hill slope assist. (when u go down any steep ramp in carparks or major roads without stepping on the accelerator pedal or foot brakes, the car will regulate itself and slow down steadily, so you can manuoever carefully. For most japanese and korean cars, the car will just roll down quick and you got to control using the foot brake.)</p>
              <p>Important thing to note, even though it is a longer way, always follow the flow of traffic to prevent getting into unnecessary accidents and trouble. Esp you are still on the yellow triangle. No point losing your hard earned licence.</p>
