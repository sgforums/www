              <p>Hi maskangel,</p>
              <p>Try http://www.eazicarlease.com.sg @ commonwealth car mall (thanks linwei20 !). (P-Plater friendly, rented with them before i got my own car)</p>
              <p>Cheap rental, quite a lot of models to choose from (Consist of mostly fiat, some toyota, honda, kia, hyundai etc).</p>
              <p>One thing to note, most are automatic transmission. If you want manual, book early (popular like hot cakes, cos cheaper). The rates can range from 40 - 130 per day (model dependant).</p>
              <p>Heard that they got packages for their cars:</p>
              <p>Monday - Friday: Min $180 (Model dependant)</p>
              <p>Friday - Monday: Min $180 (Model dependant)</p>
              <p>Weekend must take 3 days, cos they don't operate on weekends.</p>
              <p>The car renting process goes like that:</p>
              <p>1. You call the company and make a booking for your desired car.</p>
              <p>2. You go down on the rental day to collect your car (stated time).</p>
              <p>3. The staff will hand you a form to fill in while they photocopy your NRIC And Driving Licence.</p>
              <p>4. If the car is not back yet, the staff will inform you to wait a while (maybe cleaning interior).</p>
              <p>5. The staff ask you to follow him/her to your rental car.</p>
              <p>6. The staff starts the engine of your rental car (checks fuel gauge level).</p>
              <p>7. The staff does an exterior body assessment. (PLEASE remember to check the car thoroughly WITH THE STAFF, even though he is already checking. Don't be lazy, it can save you from unnecessary disputes or claims).</p>
              <p>8. Once done, sign on the form to indicate acceptance, pay the full amount, and drive off.</p>
              <p>9. Drive carefully and on the day before u return, check the car for any  "additional dents" or scratches, (might not be caused by you, but other son ** ***** at carparks).</p>
              <p>10. Purchase turtlewax or other reliable wax to try to remove the minor scratches.</p>
              <p>11. Return the amount of petrol that came with the car. (Means if you got the car at half tank petrol, top up back to half tank before you return).</p>
              <p>12. Return in order and walk away happily    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>IN CASE OF ANY MISHAP OR ACCIDENT</strong>, please notify the rental company. They will ask you to bring the car to any workshop of your choice to make good, before you return. I think they don't charge you for the additional time that you use the car (while its sitting at repair workshop).</p>
              <p>Hope this non-comprehensive guide helps.</p>

              <p>No lah.. you cannot say like that. Hahaha.. You must train yourself up to overcome the obstacle, not to avoid it.</p>
              <p>Multi-Storey carparks are easy. Before turning towards "up" or "down", position your car at the outer, further away from the turn, and then turn inwards early. That should do the trick.</p>

              <p>Basically, Yes.</p>
              <p>I duno whether they still have the "delivery" service, at additional cost. You can try asking them.</p>
              <p>Go rent the Fiat Punto, if you looking at budget low cost. And they even have the skydome version (moonroof), at no additional cost. Opt for that if you taking the car for a date.</p>

              <p>Multi-Storey carparks are easy. Before turning towards "up" or
              "down", position your car at the outer, further away from the turn,
              and then turn inwards early. That should do the trick.</p>
