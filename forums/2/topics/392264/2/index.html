              rent for that 8times? Can you remember? Each time you rent for how
              many days? Hmm you mentioned this car 'Fiat Grande Punto' is an
              Auto or Manual? What do you men by dualogic selespeed gearbox?</p>

              <p>ya, rented 8 times. Most of the times i took Fiat Punto (with skydome), the rest i took Toyota Vios (the older model). each time rent the whole weekend. Fiat Punto by itself is an Auto car, but it performs like a manual car too. On the gearbox, you can switch between auto and manual transmission, but without the clutch footwork.</p>
              <p>Selespeed is the name of the technology used by Alfa Romeo (Fiat). it is basically a dualogic gearbox, allowing driver to switch between auto and manual transmission. The disadvantage about selespeed is that if you do not know how to control it well, the gear shifts can be pretty jerky, especially from Gear 1 - 2. Other than that, Fiat punto has a sweet fuel consumption (average 16.5km/litre, though i hit 19km/litre before).</p>
              <p>Turtlewax is a kind of polish that can remove minor minor scratches.. But be prepared to put in some effort, because it takes time..</p>
              <p>I am a huge fan of Fiat Grande Punto, intend to switch to a 3-year old one with skydome, that i saw from sgcarmart. But the interior space loses to my Carens.</p>

              <p>Bro, you mean they changed another car for you instead of verna?</p>
              <p>haha.. The reason that you need to return at 5pm is because....... Friday is the start of the weekend package. And they often promise customers that they can come down at 5pm to collect the cars for the weekend.</p>

              <p>But seriously, they used to have a better service, when they were at Turf City. Not an issue for me though, i got my own car now.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>if you rent monday - wednesday, i think not worth it. Cos you pay almost $ 50 - $ 60 per day, which amounts to $ 180 for three days. Might as well you take the car till Friday, and you only pay like $ 180, which is about $ 36 per day.</p>
