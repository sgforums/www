            <div class='col-md body'>actually i support so_nice to make donation. Huangna and the gj cases are differrent in the way that the dependent(children) were victims and the independents(parents) should be able to survive. But in this case, the independent (Xueli) was the victim. Her parents(dependent on her income) will have difficulty finding livelihood in future. Let's not forget that Xueli changed from her formal job to sales because she want to provide more for her parents retirement.<br>Many singaporeans are not insured enough, and i assume Xueli would be a typical singaporean to shoo away insurance advisors. Even if she did have a cover, with her income, how much can the sum assured be?<br>To prevent the money from being misused, we can use the money gathered to purchase a deferred annuity to ensure that their retirement is secured. How abt that?</div>
