            <div class='col-md body'>I have one car (toyota) and one van (renault).<br>The Van is 1.4A Kangoo.  It is a good van for work &amp; leisure, especially this is a auto petrol version.  So far so good, going to two years.<br>It depends on yours need.  Van is much cheaper, now should be around $35K-$36K.  But pls note the "speed limit of 50 km/hr" and the "noise when exceed the speed limit".........and the resale value.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My family owns a Renault Kangoo but I'm not the one driving it thus can't really say much, but rumours are that there's a timing belt problem with this car. Oh btw, we encounter problem for battery before as well, consider the van is less than 2 yrs old.<br><br>From what I know, the citron belingo is a better car, maybe you can check it out.</div>

May be, because it is petrol version and auto gear.</div>

Renault produce one of the best engine the world can provide. Although not to smooth but the torque is high. Mine had run under high rev consistently for 3 years and it is still serving me very well.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>everyone has their own comments, and feel abt each different cars. So let's not get so angry over some1's comment. I mean, to some Korea car are good but to some, they are not.<br><br>Me for instances, won't get a Renault or Korea car is there's a chance. In fact, I would rather go for brand like Suzuki or even Daihatsu if budget is low. Or, thailand assemble Jap cars like City &amp; Vios.<br><br>But the botomline is, more important is that you like your own ride, that's all. Cheers~!</div>
