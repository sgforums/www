The Mitsubishi car is the LANCER WRC, because its based on the lancer platform, as the evo is. U have to bear in mind that an Evo is still considered a lancer, because of the naming nomenclature within today's automotive industry AND the introduction of the WRC category and rules which took over from the previous Group A rules.<br><br>Thus the Subaru's car is the Impreza WRC, Ford uses the Focus RS WRC, Citroen uses the Xsara WRC, Peugeot uses the 307 WRC while Skoda uses the Fabia WRC. The point is tho, that these cars were choosen AND named probably for their marketing value as well as other more mechanical concerns. If you look at this group, many of them are in the small to middle family car category. Manufacturers take part in motorsport largely to sell cars. So if that was not of concern, a team could probably name their car the "Fat Ass Shithead WRC" and FIA wouldn't give a damn.</div>

And I believe this is the case. Both of u sounded equally convincing.... there must alwas be a reason why cars are design that way, the components that are added into the chassis.<br><br>Believing is only when you have handled a wide variety of car makes at difference time frame.
