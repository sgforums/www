The fine line of distinction is what you defined as "mistakes".<br><br>What I am saying is that with the same model car without such gadgets vis-a-vis the same car but gadget-filled , and using the same driver - he can and should go around the track quicker with the gadget cars. BUT not becos his mistakes are "forgiven" or "corrected" BUT becos the car's limit has been pushed to a different level.<br><br>The driver's skill (to me) is irrelevant - i.e. replace the same driver with a bad driver; the outcome would generally be the same.<br><br>Yaw control, ABS, etc were invented for the daily driver who could not "throw" the weight of the car for better traction, had little idea about effective braking, etc (like me)... At the end of the day, to say that a certain electronic gadget helps to forgive or correct a driver's mistake is too harsh. Why? Think about it, its a little hypocritical to say that when almost every car on the road has ABS, power steering, some sort of traction control, etc... you know what I am getting at?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Or do you need me to tell you how to use a dictionary now? Your statements have been implying that the AYC makes up for the lack of skill in the driver. The AYC is an excellent "traction enhancement device" PERIOD. It works all the time, whether the driver is good or not, is beside the point. When its limits are eventually overcome, you HAVE to be good to get back control PERIOD.</div>

The fine line of distinction is what you defined as "mistakes".<br><br>What I am saying is that with the same model car without such gadgets vis-a-vis the same car but gadget-filled , and using the same driver - he can and should go around the track quicker with the gadget cars. BUT not becos his mistakes are "forgiven" or "corrected" BUT becos the car's limit has been pushed to a different level.<br><br>The driver's skill (to me) is irrelevant - i.e. replace the same driver with a bad driver; the outcome would generally be the same.<br><br>Yaw control, ABS, etc were invented for the daily driver who could not "throw" the weight of the car for better traction, had little idea about effective braking, etc (like me)... At the end of the day, to say that a certain electronic gadget helps to forgive or correct a driver's mistake is too harsh. Why? Think about it, its a little hypocritical to say that when almost every car on the road has ABS, power steering, some sort of traction control, etc... you know what I am getting at?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>true. ayc and acd in addition to abs does allow the car to brake later and turn sharper than other cars for the occasional track driver.<br><br>perhaps the use of the term "forgiving" here needs to be re-evaluated, but i still feel however that the presence of such gadgetry does allow for quicker lap times. if i put the same driver who commits the same mistakes at the same corner in an evo GSR and the next with an evo RS, chances are, the GSR would clock faster times. though differing in nature, the idea of replacing a bad driver with a good one on the same vehicle would also yield similar improvement in results, as the smarter/more skillful driver would know exactly when to brake, turn and accelerate to get the most traction in any given scenario compared to one who relies purely on electronic gadgets and devices to get him outta a tricky situation.<br><br>being an average driver myself, i personally wished my car had ayc. then again being FF, i personally have no choice but to to put in more effort on my driving if i want to keep up with the rexes and evos on track days. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

I think you should delete the "occasional track driver" in the above statement...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tailslide:</div><div class="quote_body">but i still feel however that the presence of such gadgetry does allow for quicker lap times. </div></blockquote>Agree...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tailslide:</div><div class="quote_body">if i put the same driver who commits the same mistakes at the same corner in an evo GSR and the next with an evo RS, chances are, the GSR would clock faster times. </div></blockquote>I specifically avoided using GSR and RS examples, as the cars are more different than just removing the SAYC. Thats why I used egs of same car, one with and one without SAYC.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tailslide:</div><div class="quote_body">though differing in nature, the idea of replacing a bad driver with a good one on the same vehicle would also yield similar improvement in results, as the smarter/more skillful driver would know exactly when to brake, turn and accelerate to get the most traction in any given scenario compared to one who relies purely on electronic gadgets and devices to get him outta a tricky situation </div></blockquote>I think thats a little bit presumptious... I refer to "compared to one who relies purely on electronic gadgets and devices to get him outta a tricky situation". I dun think drivers will go around the track thinking "the SAYC and ACD will get me out of a mess"; rather one would think "I can push the car around this corner faster"... so like I said before, the gadgetry brings the car to a different level than without it. Hence entering into a sweeping corner too quickly, will get some input from the ayc but it will not get you around the track in the fastest manner. ayc is meant to provide traction to wheels have more traction, its not a miracle pill, I guess thats what I am saying.</div>
