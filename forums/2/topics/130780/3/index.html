The chassis would probably break under the added stress if you change the engine and up the horsepower... Then again, I've never seen a Lancer get bent in half, should be interesting to see... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If you get a chance, compare the front and rear fenders of both cars to notice the subtle difference. The bulge for the rear fender actually begins in the middle of the rear doors, which makes a "TS to WRX" conversion very much more difficult. As a result, the undercarriage front and rear anti-sway bars taken from an evo will not fit a lancer.<br><br>Edited: Oh forgot to mention, looking at the rear of these cars, one will notice that for the evo, the 2 rear backlights are distinct and separate - unlike the lancer, where the inner rear light "eats" into the outer light. Hence a face-lift is still quite obvious for the experienced/trained eyes</div>

It affords traction where there was none in the first place. The AYC is an electronically controlled hydraulically activated differential, it is NOT a viscous coupling unit. It affords better control than even a "traditional" clutch/cam LSD since there are individual sensors for individual wheel speed, lateral and longitudinal g, brake and handbrake application, steering wheel angle etc so that the ACD+AYC combination knows what is expected of it all times.<br><br>In practice, if you were to compare an AYC-equipped Evo with a non-AYC-equipped Evo on a surface with differing traction qualities, the one with AYC will have better grip and move off more smoothly with minimal tire slip. And it has been shown repeatedly that an AYC-equipped Evo turns in better lap times than a similar non-AYC-equipped Evo. All cars were driven by professionals, and the drivers were swapped around to minimize bias.</div>

The thing is that some prejudiced individuals are unable to look beyond their rose-tinted glasses and see the larger picture. Traction control has been around for ages, and has proven its effectiveness repeatedly. BMWs have DSC, but you don't read about VAG enthusiasts saying "Oh... the car is fast because of DSC" now do you? Why?<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if these individuals are also anti-ABS. Modern day ABS is very good on tarmac, there are certain situations such as rally where it is desirable to drive without ABS, but in most cases, it does a very good job at braking the car while allowing the driver to remain in control. However it can be shown that ABS can be much better than even the best professional drivers under certain conditions e.g. rain on wet tarmac.</div>

It affords traction where there was none in the first place. The AYC is an electronically controlled hydraulically activated differential, it is NOT a viscous coupling unit. It affords better control than even a "traditional" clutch/cam LSD since there are individual sensors for individual wheel speed, lateral and longitudinal g, brake and handbrake application, steering wheel angle etc so that the ACD+AYC combination knows what is expected of it all times.<br><br>In practice, if you were to compare an AYC-equipped Evo with a non-AYC-equipped Evo on a surface with differing traction qualities, the one with AYC will have better grip and move off more smoothly with minimal tire slip. And it has been shown repeatedly that an AYC-equipped Evo turns in better lap times than a similar non-AYC-equipped Evo. All cars were driven by professionals, and the drivers were swapped around to minimize bias.</div></blockquote>and how prejudiced is it of me to say that the 2 comparisons are mutually exclusive? my point has always been aimed at commending the AYC for its efficiency, which covers in essence wat u have brought over in point. the point of ur post here is equally redundant.</div>

The thing is that some prejudiced individuals are unable to look beyond their rose-tinted glasses and see the larger picture. Traction control has been around for ages, and has proven its effectiveness repeatedly. BMWs have DSC, but you don't read about VAG enthusiasts saying "Oh... the car is fast because of DSC" now do you? Why?<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if these individuals are also anti-ABS. Modern day ABS is very good on tarmac, there are certain situations such as rally where it is desirable to drive without ABS, but in most cases, it does a very good job at braking the car while allowing the driver to remain in control. However it can be shown that ABS can be much better than even the best professional drivers under certain conditions e.g. rain on wet tarmac.</div></blockquote>then again, I don't think tailslide was scoofing at the AYC. indeed, he acknowledges that it is a wonderful thing to have on a car. he is just saying that despite that, skills will still play a part when piloting a car is concerned.</div>
