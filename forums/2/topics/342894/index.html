              <p>i've a question for car owners regarding my fren's "habits".</p>
              <p>my frens and i arranged to meet at chinatown today and i was waiting at chinatown
              today at 5pm. den at 5:30pm, my fren called me and insisted i go over
              to outrum park to meet him because he doesn't know where to park his
              car. den i told him i've no idea and asked him to come over asap. he
              does not accept so i got pissed off.<br><br>den later, he asked my other frens to join him
              in his car park adventure. den somehow, they went over to suntec. and
              insisted two of us (whom are at chinatown) to go over to suntec. so i
              asked him, why couldn't he park there and come over to chinatown
              instead since there were more activities at chinatown. he refused and
              insisted us to go over. in the end, we waded through the crowds and
              took mrt over. his reason for not coming over: because he drove, and he
              refuse to move anywhere from his car's location.<br><br><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">question is: if you were him, would you mind parking your car and take mrt from city hall to chinatown?</span></span></p>

              <p>Actually I would mind. Coz parking charges at both places similar. Whats more must waste $ to take MRT.</p>
              <p>But personally, I feel, as a driver who has driven virtually everyday for the last 3 years, your friend was at fault. Having a car is not a big deal and he shouldn't ask others to go to somewhere, last minute, just because of parking issues. If he wanted to change location at the last minute, he should have went down to pick the both of you up and go to the new location.</p>
              <p>If not, he should think about both of your feelings and try to find a parking lot in the Chinatown vicinity. Sometimes, I even park somewhere further and take a 5 min walk if I have to to the destination where my friends are meeting if there is no parking lot nearby. I am, personally, against the idea of waiting 10-20 mins at a congested carpark just for a parking lot.</p>

              <p>No offence but this statement, to me at least, is flawed and misleading. Places like Chinatown, Orchard Road, Suntec etc during weekends, dinner time can really be a bitch in finding parking lots.</p>
              <p>But actually, I have a different viewpoint from you with regards to parking. If I am going to CBD area for a long time, I will park at the Stadium Park and Ride and take a bus in as Parking charges are obscene there. Not to mention the ERP.</p>

              <p>well, advise your friend that sometime,parked at one destination and than took the mrt down to meet friend is also good :- 1. in case the other side donot have carprk lot escpecially when there are activities held there. 2. dun have to pay for erp or gantries especially chinatown.</p>
              <p>u sometime, do left my car at home or to "free"carpark at the weekend and took mrt or bus with my family to orchard or chinatown as there alot of crowds and trafic flow will be slow.furthermore, we can walk and sightseeing  as we shop around.</p>
              <p>when one drive ,especially on the steering wheel, you can't enjoy the sight-seeing as u need to keep your eyes on the road than the passengers beside and at the rear of the car. they are enjoying all the fun.  ask him to at least try out once. </p>

              <p>No offence but this statement, to me at least, is flawed and
              misleading. Places like Chinatown, Orchard Road, Suntec
              etc during weekends, dinner time can really be a bitch in
              finding parking lots.</p>
              <p>But actually, I have a different viewpoint from you with regards
              to parking. If I am going to CBD area for a long time, I will park
              at the Stadium Park and Ride and take a bus in as Parking charges
              are obscene there. Not to mention the ERP.</p>

              hmm... i get where u r coming from but i have differing views.
              i'm more of a lazy person.. LoL!
              i usually park at places where i will go, even at multiple places.
              i dunno for u but for me, when the decision to own a car was made, parking in CBD etc were factored in.
              
              perhaps is due to the teachings of my parents, they said "if u can only afford to own a car when u scrimp n save on the parking n ERP, then wat's the point of owning a car (luxury)? owning a car is to have the convenience n not to trouble urself. if u cant afford the car along wif parking charges n ERP, then dun buy the car."

              <p>But I really hate driving round and round to look for parking when carpark is full....it really tests my short-lived patience.</p>
