            <div class='col-md body'>Actually this case can be considered as Hit &amp; Run case. Your friend should call the police at 999 so that they can road block or look out for that particular car. Even though if no one is injured, they will consider as a case.<br><br>For now, it may be to late. If not, you can try going to Cycle &amp; Carriage body workshops and find the car there. The driver may properly send it to the agent's workshop.<br><br>And since you have the first 2 letters of the Subaru, maybe you want to make a police report at the TP HQ and giving them the details you have on hand, and since a hit and run, they will investigate and get something in return.<br><br>A year or so ago, a car hit my front bumper at a car park. Then it drove away. Don't know a kind soul left a note of the vehicle number on my windscreen. I went to the police station, and they say no injuries, they don't care. But I told them it is hit n run, since the driver did not stop and drove away. They cannot tahan me and make a report. An investigation is carried out and the driver was charged with careless driving and forgotten, still got one more charge.</div>

At the very least, they should scout resident repair shops and pass the word out on the make and alleged damage to the veh so that those OEMs can feedback should the guy bring his car in. Customs should be on the lookout too, in case he tries to go Johor to seek repairs.<br><br>This is a CLEAR case of hit and run. But expect them to turn the case to back to you once they have located the culprit. You can then claim damages accordingly.<br><br>The only way he can escape is if he left the country that very night to johor to do repairs and spray paint his car to avoid detection. But that's a worse-case senario.<br></div>
