            <div class='col-md body'>when it comes to drifting no one i know, dead or alive, can beat gilles for skills and car control.<br><br>hes the only driver i've ever heard of who was so skilled he could win a race in an underpowered car by drifting fast into corners and then controlling it so he actually bounced off the walls very gently! that way he could corner very fast. this happened in a formula alantic race or something which James Hunt, 76 F1 world champion took part in. He noticed Gilles with this remarkable feat, recommended him for a test drive with McLaren, and the rest is history.</div>

I had it set at 45-55... and it drove a hoot from there on in.. loved it too bad I had to sell the car... sob... will be looking for an R34 Vspec next.. when the time is right. Till then, my 5 series has to keep me happy.</div>
