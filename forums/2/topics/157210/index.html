            <div class='col-md body'>to all the drivers who are afraid of being tanned:<br><br>the great late Richard Feynman viewed an atomic bomb explosion during the Manhatten project without any eye-shade protection. He simply watched it in his truck from behind the windscreen. The nobel prize laurate reasoned that since blindness is caused by excessive ultraviolet and the windscreen is more than able to shield off most of the UV rays, he thought he could just watch the explosion with his naked eyes from his truck. He lived to see till he died of cance in 1988.<br><br>What I want to say is that your glass windows can shield off most UV rays. If you look at all those solar films in the market, which brand doesn't say UV shield is 99% effective? This is because UV is most easily shielded. What is difficult is infrared radiation. That small amount of UV that entered your car is not going to cause much tan. Hence, there isn't much need for you to shield with a piece of cloth.<br><br>Maybe I am wrong, but is there anyone who noticed themselves being tanned in a car? I have heard of cases where one arm is tanned more than another. So far this might just be an urban legend. I've never seen one. Did anyone saw such cases yourselves? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
