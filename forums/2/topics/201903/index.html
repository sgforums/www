            <div class='col-md body'>ok. i just got a summon today.<br><img src="http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m78/vigelic/parknonsense/notice2.jpg"><br><br>Rule 12(1): "<strong>Failure to obey sign(s) displayed in a parking place</strong>."<br>But I was fined for <strong>parking "Inside Parking Lot, Against Traffic Flow."</strong><br><br><img src="http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m78/vigelic/parknonsense/Image2042.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m78/vigelic/parknonsense/Image2002.jpg"><br><br>as u can see from the above photos - nothing looks wrong right? WRONG.<br><br>the toyota wish in the 2nd photo is committing the same offence as me! why? because he shld be facing the other way! By parking facing this way he is also "inside parking lot, against traffic flow." hope he didn't get a summon after me.<br><br>did any of u know of this rule? anyway i've appealed to the URA with these photos and more.<br><br><strong>here's my letter:</strong><br>I received the said offence today (25/07/06) for breaking law number 12(1) as printed on your "notice of parking offence". On the overleaf, 12(1) says "Failure to obey sign(s) displayed in a parking place.Â”<br><br>This is utterly ridiculous. Firstly, I made an effort to look for signs when I arrived at this road (Ann Siang Road). It was not even a car park in the first place. It was merely a road. It had 2 lanes, separated by a dotted line - which means parking on both sides of the road are ALLOWED unless there are other lines drawn on either side. I was happy as this meant I had found a place to park and I thought the government was so helpful as to draw boxes to guide cars to park. However, to be on the safe side, I looked for signs and found a CARPARK sign. So I realised I had to pay to occupy these lots but I still decided to park here. I followed the vehicle in front of me and it stopped to park in an empty lot on the right that was ahead of me. I looked around me to my left and right for other empty lots. There were none on my left. At this moment, a vehicle vacated a lot on my right and waved at me to signal that I could occupy his lot. It was an adult male. I thanked him with a wave and, just like the car in front of me, I parked into the empty lot on the right. Directly in front of me was a lorry that I could only see the back of. In other words, he was facing in the same direction as me. The vehicle behind me was ALSO facing this direction. So were all the cars on the left.<br><br>As a relatively new driver, I look to seasoned drivers for guidance. I parked properly and made sure my car was in the lot. When I got out, I even walked one round around my vehicle to make sure I was not obstructing traffic. I then promptly went to the ONLY sign and read it so as to know how much to pay for half an hour. There were NO OTHER SIGNS around. I promptly OBEYED the displayed sign in that parking place and put a $1 coupon on my dashboard. I then locked the car and left.<br><br>To my horror, I found the said notice under my wipers upon my return. The offence was as I said - rule 12(1). Another line wrote that I was fined for parking inside a parking lot - against traffic flow 19 (*). This line is in itself ridiculous! How can I be "against traffic flow" when I'm "in a parking lot"! Parking lots can't possibly go against traffic flows! They're STATIONARY RECTANGLES DRAWN ON THE SURFACE! Furthermore, as I am a relatively new driver - I still have my basic theory fresh in my mind. There is NO LAW STATED in the theory books that you HAVE TO face a certain direction when your car is parked! I was taught that I could park head in or head out for vertical - it was my choice! Likewise for parallel - I was taught that parallel parking could be done both to the left and right! It didn't matter which way I faced my vehicle as long as I was in a legal parking spot / parking lot! How can I be fined for facing my car in a direction the URA did not like? Furthermore - most of the other cars were parked like this! I followed the example of the lorry in front and the car behind me as well as the car that vacated the lot and the car that parked before me! Granted - the lorry was facing head-to-head with another car. But what problem does that pose?? What is the logic behind this rule?<br><br>On top of that - I was even accused of disobeying a sign - of which doesn't even EXIST! There was no sign that specifically stated that "Cars parked on this side of the road MUST face in ---&gt; Direction. Or else FINE $50." If there was such a sign or anything likewise, I would have promptly made a LEGAL 3 POINT TURN - taking into account the dotted line in the middle of the road (which means u-turning on this road is legal). However, this would simply be another ridiculous thing to do as this would obstruct traffic flow! Which I believe is WORSE than what direction a vehicle faces when in a parking lot! Other than being aesthetically beautiful to see all vehicles on one side of the road facing in the same direction, I DO NOT SEE what logic could have possibly made this a law! I also promptly snapped photos of the area upon discovering my notice. These will be attached to a separate e-mail and sent to ura_cpplu@ura.gov.sg.<br><br>Note: There were only 2 signs displayed in this Â“parking placeÂ”. The Â“Warning: Hump Ahead. Slow.Â” Sign and the car park sign (The one with a huge P over a car on a blue background)<br><br><strong>------------------------------</strong><br>Will update when I get a response. This is ridiculous! Fined for facing wrong way! Argh. Never heard of this absurd rule. u guys b careful nxt time. oh and the volvo in the photo parked behind me is also committing this offence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think one cannot argue with the rules. ignorance is not bliss. but there should be some `allowance' given for varying situation.<br><br>in your case, it seems like it should be ok, since the road is 2 single lane bboth sides. and if the traffic is light at the time u park, there should not be an issue.<br><br>i have done so numerous times @ amoy street, but lucky so far.<br><br>u should appeal under those situation, the traffic is very light, u poses no danger to the situation, u are new and u learnt your lesson, etc. And see how it goes...<br><br>I agree with most that the ura attendants are trigger happy. however, SG is certainly not the `worst' in my mind. in NZ, my car rental was towed away 2x in my 1st 2 days becos i parked in places i wasn't supposed to. Talk about ignorance then, i clearly dun understand what those lines meant, and i gotta pay the tow fees, however they let me off on the fines. equally `bad'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Argument point......... Tell URA if you're against the flow of traffic while parking, the centre divided dotted line also meant that can overtake any vehicle infront of you. So just say that while you overtaking, you saw a parking lot and decided to park in the lot.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Aiya, you new driver. Go see initial d then do hand brake turn. Dun need 3 point turn so ma huan.<br><br>If like that also can summon, URA si beh hor tan....

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, parking or driving against flow of traffic is an offence.  Let say if you want to drive off or move into the lot, you actually drove against flow of traffic before you move to back the correct lane (flow of traffic) or move into the lot. DO you agree?  If you are spotted by TP, the offence carries demerit points too, not sure how many, if I am correct, penalty is $150 + 6 points?<br><br>On the road, you have to follow highway code at all times, there won't be so many signs to tell you this cannot that cannot.<br><br>Drive Safely......<br></div>
