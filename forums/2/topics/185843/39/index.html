This started as I thought your talk was pretty authoritative.<br><br>Let me quote: "For a long time the darkside have been trying ! Sure de club can achieve that !<br><br>if stock and non stock can house as one ! A march is still a march k12, that's a fact ! The biggest fleet ever clocked was 26 marchies when all come under as one. WOULD LIKE THE RECORD to be BROKEN ! we had yet to see &gt;30 marchies in one single meet up since 2004 Dec.<br><br>If all non stock and stock can come as one... ! Tribute to our founder "addygal ". If we can have (All colors) and a big fleet of marchies."<br><br>You talk someone with authority talking about achieving this and achieving that, Club record, club Moto and all. Really a champion...<br><br>"Go spend more time in dressing and enhancing yr ride that is good time being put into use. " Oh so now must dress up and mod the ride to be part of K12? Hmmm thought you said K12 is K12. No need dress up/mod also can right?<br><br>"Are you getting into private topics of individuals or it is a mandatory function to call everyone in the club. "Well we find you an interesting topic and since you like the attention we give it to you and it never fails to conjure up a good laugh when we do that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you were heading towards Jalan Eunos from Eunos Link, and you got caught in a incredible jam stretching from the junction of Bedok Reservior in the evening hours of 7-8pm y'day. Yep. That was my doing.<br><br>I was heading to my friend's wedding dinner at Clarke Quay and was going by way of PIE from Ubi. Keeping to the right lane, I saw an object on the road, dead centre of the lane. As the vehicle in front had no trouble clearing it, I anticipated being able to clear it as well. (But in my heart, I was 60% unsure.)<br><br>There was a tight screeching and chilling sound. I immediately stopped my car, put on the hazards and inspected the damage.<br><br>The object resembled a crushed metal dustbin. It was stuck square under my carriage. And I could touch it, but not extricate it.<br><br>I considered using my jack, but was uncertain if there was damage beyond cosmetic scratches. And I made up my mind early that it was best that a workshop could examine the undercarriage and advise me on any substantial damage that might have occured.<br><br>So I called up TC's emergency line and gave them the go ahead to send a tow truck.<br><br>Additionally, I placed my little triangle 15 metres behind my vehicle. The little triangle was a valiant sacrifice. It got run over within 15 minutes of placement.<br><br>I waited in my car and thought about the next things to do. The tow truck took 1 hour to arrive. In the meantime, after my triangle got squashed, I stood outside the car, in the pouring rain to attempt guiding vehicles off to the next lane.<br><br>My ride is still at TC Ubi. Their customer service has told me that they are checking for me, and thus far, no significant damage other than scratches. They will inspect further and will call me again to update.<br><br>That's all for now folks. Any advice for follow up action?<br><br></div>

(But in my heart, I was 60% unsure.)<br><br>There was a tight screeching and chilling sound. I immediately stopped my car, put on the hazards and inspected the damage.<br><br>The object resembled a crushed metal dustbin. It was stuck square under my carriage. And I could touch it, but not extricate it.<br><br>I considered using my jack, but was uncertain if there was damage beyond cosmetic scratches. And I made up my mind early that it was best that a workshop could examine the undercarriage and advise me on any substantial damage that might have occured.<br><br>So I called up TC's emergency line and gave them the go ahead to send a tow truck.<br><br>Additionally, I placed my little triangle 15 metres behind my vehicle. The little triangle was a valiant sacrifice. It got run over within 15 minutes of placement.<br><br>I waited in my car and thought about the next things to do. The tow truck took 1 hour to arrive. In the meantime, after my triangle got squashed, I stood outside the car, in the pouring rain to attempt guiding vehicles off to the next lane.<br><br>My ride is still at TC Ubi. Their customer service has told me that they are checking for me, and thus far, no significant damage other than scratches. They will inspect further and will call me again to update.<br><br>That's all for now folks. Any advice for follow up action?<br><br></div></blockquote>oh poor thing... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> hope the damage isnt too bad.</div>

Didn't sound like fun at all especially given the rain and you were probably dressed for a wedding dinner!  The ground clearance for the March is unfortunately lower than other cars (135mm compared to 160mm for Corolla Altis), so better try to go around rather than over things on the road.  Good thing is that since it's a FWD, the only important thing below is the exhaust piping.  They design the bottom to withstand hits from the road like stones and sticks, so the car should be fine.<br><br>It's easier to remove items off the road when you're a pedestrian rather than motorist.  When I see large stones, sticks, nails, and other things that shouldn't be on the road, I will pick it up and throw it off the road so it doesn't cause trouble to road users.  Some people think I'm crazy when I do it, but I just hope that others will take 5 seconds from their walk and pick these things up.  It will cause a lot more trouble if/when incidents occur.<br><br>Hope you get your Air Blue March on the road again soon!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Dun Frighten others abt the warranty.<br>? Warranty voids only you go for advance tunning and mod the cams and pistons or install a supper charger or others like drop in a 1.5 Latio engine or a b16 engine ! or worst off drop in a SR12 engine(manual)...!<br><br>Dressing up and basic tunning will not void the warranty.<br><br>Basic tunning or Fundamentals changes.<br><br>1.
