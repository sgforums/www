Hope the following can give u some guide.<br><br>When was your last servicing done and at what mileage.<br><br>1. Do you hear knocking noise increases when u accelerate more, and car speed doesn't change. Is there a lost of power ?<br><br>The chances of accelerating more to keep the engine running will cause more harm to the pistons and cams. DO NOT try to drive it hard or even step on the pedals to pump more gas, more damage than any good.<br><br>2. Did you check engine light comes on and stays there during knocking, before you push your gear to Â“NÂ”. when you start you engine does it gives off thick visible white smoke from your tail pipe " exhaust".<br><br>3. It could be automatic transmission problem or more than 10 possibilities of other problems.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>You might need to run a ECU test with TC asap.<br>At this moment you are unable to point out the cause of the knocking, and it is difficult to identify the root problem by yrself. Is safer to head back to TC for a check up, since you are under warranty the only place for you is TC  ?<br><br>Tks<br></div></blockquote>Hey, thankss guys for your advice!<br><br>I just sent my 1 1/2 years-old marchie to TC (Ubi) this morning. F.y.i, my car's mileage stands at 17,500km (?quite low). The last servicing was done 2 months ago at TC. This morning, the consultant &amp; i went on a "test-drive" but didn't experience those vibrations. They did a diagnostic test (= ECU?) which found nothing abnormal, serviced + cleaned the throttle chamber + re-tuned the engine - my marchie seems smoother a drive now, especially when moving from gear 2 to 4...haven't experienced those turbulent vibrations again...(hopefully not ever again)<br><br>Just wondering if it's all because i drove through a little flood (till about 1-2/3 of the height of the tyre) last Monday when it was raining very heavily? I haven't seen any white fumes from the exhaust all this while though..but maybe some of those muddy stuff + accumulated gunk ended up the exhaust and thus choked up the air intake system / throttle plate / ??<br><br>Oh boy, hope my marchie will stay well man...</div>

"best" is best personal perference and also the green bags you have.. for a cost of $1.7k tanabe coil overs is better than Tein I feel but not the best !  " G-Attack / S-Tune " is different, expensive and is not lowered like the rest, pls compare specs for performance and ability.. ! Again it depends, your choice of coil overs should base on your own perference. Even lower springs are different too, Tein, kg/mn,espelier and etc..! It boils down to you own liking and $$. i have done tones of research on Tanabe and recommended to Mattew, he like the Tanabe is good and i agreed becos i payed for $1.3k Tein wagons coil overs dun do me any comfort. Now is in storage... and i not abt to recommend it.<br><br>1. $$<br>2. lowered or not lowered<br>3. comfort or hard<br>4. performance or not performance<br>5. Street / track.<br><br>Many k12 coil overs will fit the above, so it all depends on what you want. May be your task is to link up this 5 points to find one coilover brand that meets all 5 points. May be start with point 1 budget.<br><br>To stop your lower springs from collapsing further on full load, go install four stoppers. The compression will not be reduce, will be stop by the stoppers.<br>The shock rebound will be slower and harder, lesser chance of hitting under undercarriage or bodykit  ! hundred over bucks... for that. !<br><br></div>

Anyway I have the directions from AA. I can pass to u... their directions are pretty clear,, anyway i clocked 1400 km to and fro.. considering that we detoured to malacca for lunch!<br><br>Cameron roads are really quite good. Not the lau kok kok kind of roads any more. Anyway best to go with gd/ new  tires.... very "touge" machiam like initial D when u wanna go down.... anyway its quite safe la road traction is quite good. When going downhill, heh heh... i free wheel and turn into the corner without braking .... coz i smelled by brakes burning when i tried braking just before the corner... in the end, i just tap brakes quickly and free wheel most of the time..( still can be quite fast)<br><br>weather is not as cold as before (blame it on global warming) but the strawberries are still great!! best for kids to do their own plucking!!...<br><br>Limited things up there for you to do, so suggest that u spend not more than 2 nites .<br><br>Pics will be posted when i finish processing....<br><br></div>
