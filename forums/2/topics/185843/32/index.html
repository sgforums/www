            <div class='col-md body'>Just went to sign the papers for my new March.  Tan Chong makes money in so many ways.  When I signed the purchase order, there was no mention of using PARF/COE rebate for my car.  Trade-in was an all-cash deal, so not using my own paper.<br><br>Then when it comes to signing, Tan Chong requires us to sign LTA form saying that we accept Tan Chong using other people's scrap paper for our car registration.  The market takes 5% cut off scrap paper from sellers, so there's plenty of money to make if Tan Chong uses these rebates for the new car registrations, since they scrap so many cars.<br><br>The other annoying thing is that my trade-in car still has 6 months road tax.  If the car is deregistered, which is most likely, then the road tax is refunded by LTA.  And guess who gets it?  The used car dealer.  Unless of course, this is stated up-front which I did.  But no use because the dealer countered by saying the car will be sold locally, so the road tax will be transferred to new owner.  I doubt it can be sold locally given the new car prices so low.<br><br>Anoter form I had to sign was the refund of the COE excess.  Makes no sense to me but SE explained that TC paid for the COE deposit and now wants it back.  My thinking is that they paid first, and now I pay TC, so we're even right?  Apparently not.  Actually first time I have to sign this form.  My previous cars didn't need to.  So don't know what I'm getting myself into by signing.<br><br>And then the AIG insurance form.  The fine print says that the car can only be brought to Motor Image for repair claims.  In front says "Nissan Auto Protector".  Looks like the office staff just took the insurance form for Subaru and changed the front page without checking inside.  But it's a legal doc.  So now I'm supposed to send my Nissan March to Motor Image for repair under the AIG insurance.  This sort of typo mistake should have been caught long time ago.<br><br>The car business is like walking through thick jungle with snakes and quicksand.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your kind thoughts.  My car was registered yesterday.  OMV $13145.  And the SE still insisted that it will be $14k just this past weekend.

Especially for someone like me with no attention to details, i felt like i was signing my life away when i bought my car. I didn't know how to negotiate and hardly got any freebies from my SE. However, I decided that it was all worth it when i got my ride. Dont' dwell on how much the dudes at TC is making, just focus on enjoying your new baby  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Afterall, spending that kind of money should mean some gratification,right?? Cheers!!</div></blockquote>The harder u negotiate, the worst sevice u going to get from the SE. The world is very realistic! When u go to luxury designer retail,they give u quality service.  Do u find anyone negiotiating? I dun think much people will do that.<br><br>Negotiate is Asian pastime. Asian love hard Negotiation. But for American and European, they do negotiation but not the hard and must well. They believe on service! They willing to pay u extra if u give them quality service. different from Asian.<br><br>Actually TC dun earn much on the car. they need u to take in house finance and insurance in order for then to generate profit. They minimum have to earn a $3 to $5k after giving salesman comm ,in order for them to cover their overhead to run the showroom.<br><br>Let the economy roll, and everyone will benefit.<br><br></div>

My car was registered yesterday.  OMV $13145.  And the SE still insisted that it will be $14k just this past weekend.  This makes Nissan an extra $2k, plus the $1.5k drop in Cat A COE.  Nissan must be smiling all the way to the bank.<br><br>Anybody else got their March registered recently?

            <div class='col-md body'>This is very strange.  How come same exact car (except for color) and same shipment have different OMV when registered a few days apart?  Another mystery in the car trade...<br><br>My color is Air Blue.  Last one for the year I think.  So I can feel special for a little while.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Thanks for the other comments.  It's not about squeezing for every last dollar.  That is not appropriate.  Completely agree.  The SEs also need to make a living.  It's about transparency and customer service.<br><br>Firstly, cars should be quoted at the same exact price for every customer.  The dealer can control this as they approve the Purchase Orders.  Extras and opt-outs also must be standard pricing.  We wouldn't question why our meal costs $100 because we know everybody gets the same price (putting aside loyalty discounts).<br><br>Secondly, under declaring OMV from the stated number during the purchase is not acceptable.  This is not only about cost.  It's about getting less than what we thought because now our paper value is lower.  Imagine topup a EZ-link card for $10 and getting $8 value.  Not right is it?<br><br>Also, the use of PARF paper from the market which is bought by Nissan at discount should be agreed upon upfront.  Customer takes the risk of fake paper as was reported in the papers last year.  Apparently the cars were not actually exported, so the paper was invalid, and LTA asked the unknowing buyers to pay for a new PARF.  That's a risk customers shouldn't take unless agreed.  If it is no risk, then why require customers to sign the LTA document confirming the use of market PARF?<br><br>Just my 2 cents, bros.<br><br>Looking forward to getting the car this weekend ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>You guys see a SGM plate AirBlue 14C, wave!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
