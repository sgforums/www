I saw it surfing on the Internet.  Hence there must be a signal coming in from the engine bay for the Tacho.<br><br>I've also seen combo meters which just plug into the cigarette lighter.  Apparently it gets all the signal/data it needs from the cigarette lighter plug.  I didn't believe it at first but I tested the car and it worked!  Heard it's a few hundred dollars though...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just did my 10k servicing at TC and opted for Synthetic Oil.  I love the engine performance right after getting fresh synthetic oil!  It just purrs along and I could swear there is more power as the pistons are moving with less friction.<br><br>TC charged me $64 as the top up.  They used Shogun 0W-30 instead of Fastflo oil.  When I asked about this, the Service Advisor said that Shogun is better (they got customer feedback that Fastflo makes the engine sluggish), but is about $20 more expensive. 0W-30 is very light and thin oil.<br><br>What has been your experience?  What oil do you use?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
