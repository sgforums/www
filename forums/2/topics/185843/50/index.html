In fact, I went back to TC and made them change the compressor.  The sound is less now, but can still hear the gurgling noise.<br><br>The other question I have is what you all think of the solar film sold by TC.

It is a very easy car to drive and park, and so is great for less confident drivers.  It stands out for different reasons than WRX with huge spoilers.

I've never heard such a thing before. The clause as I understand was just a form of protection, but was not part of their intention to use it to get out of a low price deal.<br><br>I think TC has alot to answer to their customers if this is the position they take. When I first signed up, I was also concerned of such practise, but was assured that TC is a reputable biz and that they do not resort to such tactics. If they really do fail in their final bid... I'll be extra vigilant when I deal with them in the future. It's distasteful.<br><br>Contracts require faithful performance from both parties. If you've been faithful in paying their monies, I do not see why they cannot keep to their part of the bargain at all, as long as they do not make a loss.<br></div>
