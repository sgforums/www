It will depend on the currency rate between singapore dollar and yens.In order for Tan Chong to sell at $46,800 for comfort and $51,800 for elegance. If not Tan Chong will be either making a lose or breakeven to sell u the car.<br><br>But for the old batch for comfort model is about $14 to $15k and elegance model is about $15 to 16k.!</div>

If u take a 100% loan for 10 years ,SE will get a loan commission of about 1.5 to 2% depend the interest rate is about $900 comm.There is car comm and insurance comm too!

I was a do-do  when i bought the car as I did not ask for solar film from my SE but realised that i really want it!<br><br>So quick question : Where can i get affordable and good solar film? Is there a big difference between V-cool and other cheaper versions?<br><br>Next : Does anyone have any advice on the care of the seats as they are really light in color so get dirty easily??

People usually recommend V-kool or 3M.<br><br>As for seats.... wait until they get dirty then put cushion covers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
