Of course i disengage OD as soon as the car reaches the top of the flyover or it reaches crusing speed of 80-90km/h. That said, you are right that there is absolutely no point still engaging OD when you are already in good cruising speed, which is a waste of fuel and you arent really going faster anymore.<br><br>i guess, our march is not that intelligent/ fast yet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
