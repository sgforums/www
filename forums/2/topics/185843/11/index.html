They are the distributor and "official" repair station for Nissan cars so if they spoil anything, I can claim warranty from them or at least hold them responsible for their slip short job. That gives me a peace of mind. As for 3rd party workshops can anyone be 100% sure they know how to replace the air filter without cracking the bowl? Guess you would know what I am talking about...<br><br>Well for the question on the offset, if you are interested why not come on down and ask them yourself. I am sure with your wealth of knowledge on cars, dress up and modification you can engage them in a constructive discussion and we all can learn from that. Well these talks are not just about promoting their products but also information sharing so we can make measured judgement ourselves. Just have to have an open mind.</div>

Thats why i ask you to ask them if they know what you know. And I know you know a lot of other things with regards to modification, dress up and tyres. I also know you know whats the best for your ride. You know i know about your passion for your car. But what you know is not all to be known, thats why I want to know more by learning from others the know how. What they know and what you know might differ. Doesn't hurt anyone who wants to know more. So how you know you know everything with regards to K12?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
