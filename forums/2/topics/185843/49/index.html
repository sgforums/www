Drive much to Malaysia?  You are driving at 3 times the average distance.  Most cars do 20k a year, you are about 60k annually!</div>

They look like decent deals because they also include parts, and the regular servicing packages don't.  The NPMP is for 10k intervals, not 20k that you mention.  But we have to buy 4 servicing in a package, which should last 2 years.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

People there are getting robbed and assaulted in broad daylight and passers-by are afraid to intervene and help.  So the car alarm is not going to bother them much.<br><br>I think the best deterrent is to avoid attention and park in well lit areas.  I usually try to park with cars of similar color and size, so it all looks alike.  I also dress like everybody else so no extra attention.  They are starting to sell the March in Malaysia so we'll soon have company in the parking lots there.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Am considering purchasing this car and am jsut wondering if this car really gets 14 km/l, and on average how much does one can plan to set aside for petrol once a month for a March if let's say the distance travelled a month is about 1200km? Is this considered a lot of driving around?<br><br>This will be my first car. So questions are prob not so high-tech (yet). Kinda worried about high fuel consumption.<br><br>Any pointers will be useful.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>(been) dreamingaboutmarch (for years)</div></blockquote>Gd morning.<br><br>If by per tank calc, I've got 14.1 and 14.0 km/l before. However, it is more consistent with my driving habits and routine to get 11-12km/l. I do alot of city driving.<br><br>Since you cite 1200km per mth, you divide that with 14, you'll get your fuel consumption, which is 85.7 litres. Esso 95 costs abt $1.60 per litre. So you'll probably have $137.12 as your expected petrol costs. Clear so far?<br><br>I tend to drive about $200-$250 worth per month. So I'll say your distance is not that alot. But it really depends on your routine. I've got girlfriend and my mommy to factor in.<br><br>By and large, even if you use 12km/l per month, it's not that much more on the pocket since you're not driving that much, (based on 1200km).</div>
