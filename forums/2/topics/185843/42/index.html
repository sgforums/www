These can run $500 to $4k depending on size, manufacturer, original or replica, forged or cast.  Get some nice grippy tyres to go with it and you have appearance and performance mod all-in-one!<br><br>Bodykit doesn't really do much for me.

Looks like my March will come in only after Chinese New Year...<br><br>I was very upset that TC not will to pay more for my COE. The Car has already been in stock and in the warehouse.<br><br>The sales did asked me to increase my COE min bid by $100 - $200 as that will increase the chance. Not sure if he is bluffing me...

So I'll refer it to Light ON or Light OFF.<br><br>I have the Light ON when I want to accelerate fast and get into the faster lanes.<br><br>But once I hit 70-80 km/h, I'll Light OFF to conserve fuel.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OD on or OFF is a really useless thing in modern cars. In fact in many cars there are no longer this OD function. I don't see this in my fathers' LexusRX300 nor in my relatives Porsche/mercedes/BMW.<br><br>The correct driving condition is not to have the OD light appearing. When there is a icon light, it means you have activated the OD function and the gear will only max change up to 3rd gear ratio. Meaning to say your engine will rotate at a higher RPM at cruising speed. Which also means you will 'feel' that your car 'power' is there for you to overtake other cars. Meaning to say you are actually burning more petrol.<br><br>OD is not some 'nitro' mystery boost that suddenly gives your car super power. Its simply a button to instruct the gear not to go into fourth gear(which in olden days its determined as the final gear or cruising gear).<br><br>Even if you leave the OD button on off(no lighted up icon), when you need to overtake some cars and need the 2nd or 3rd gear power all you need to do is STOMP on the pedal all the way. The Fuzzy logic will drop the transmission to 2nd or 3rd gear for you AUTOMATICALLY, and you can feel the 'power' for overtaking immediately.<br><br>OD is actually a oddity that is carried forward from the 70's &amp; 80's auto transmission WHERE the gear selection Fuzzy logic is not intelligent/fast enough.<br><br></div>
