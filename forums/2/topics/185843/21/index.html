The drive will take about 7 hours or so, therefore we should reach about 2-3pm, I hope  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> We'll make 2 stops along the way to rest and eat and pee and top up. We'll probably take the Simpang Pulai route which some say have lesser heavy vehicles and less chances of the passengers puking in the car as it is less winding.<br><br>Besides enjoying the surroundings, visiting strawberry farms, tea farms or whatever farms they have, jungle walk, I guess we'll spend a lot of our time eating and lazing around taking it slow.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/travel/tg/lp/37/150x157_371bbe27df18021258a5d28f854b557a.jpg"><br><br>We'll spend 2 days on Cameron and return to SIN on 18th Sep. We'll probably reach JB in the evening and maybe we can have a dinner before we return to SIN. Again there are some in the group who have been there before so they will know better what to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
