"missing in action "<br><br>Just a brief, of my 2cents worth of facts and experience:<br><br>1. Model BK-12, 1.4L 4AT<br>Engine: 16v DOHC<br>Performance: 0- 100 km/h @11.5 sec<br>Power to weight ratio: 98 hp / 975kg (9.94 kg per horse power pull at crank)<br><br>Personal Experiences and Remarks: (Light weight, the car has sufficient torque, pick up response is good, engine is quite when you start it, a few occasions I dun even release my engine was on and I restart it again when I warm up the car in the morning) Is a little under powered when you climb the Benjamin S. bridge with full load. Trotler is pretty responsive for light footed drivers bcos the car has good torque for lower gears. (Factory suspensions are soft, good for tight city driving and turning, tamper rebound too responsive), (ABS: I rate it at 7.5 /10 rating with stock specs on braking power, but different tyres will give your different performance braking on the road and also brake pads / calipers). Steering wheel is light with integrated Electronic PS, easy to perform parking and negotiate tight corners. Easy city driving car.<br><br>2. 2002 Europe Design car of the year.<br>Personal Experiences &amp; Remarks: Interiors: Good head room, very roomy and reasonable passenger space, front driver leg room is roomy for me.<br>(2+2 adults acceptable, 2+3 is a little pack at the back ) (Jersey materials- seat covers (a little hot at times), bad marketing becos the car does not come with leathers) (Sound proofing-&gt; noise slip through side doors and engine bay itself infront of the front driver area has thin layer of S.proofing from factory, the Roof: gets a little nosy when it is down pouring heavily) (There are wind nosy from the side above a certain speed and it is still acceptable)<br><br>Overall is not a bad car to drive, it all depends on yourself on what you look for when you choose a car Â“design of carÂ”, Â“performanceÂ”, Â“specsÂ”, Fuel C, comfort, practicality and price factorÂ…Â….. Not forgetting reliability.<br><br>Just take 4 hatch back cars to compare and you will know what to do.<br>I did these comparisons before purchasing, Citron C3, Toyota IST, Toyota BB 1.3L and Opel Corsa with the Nissan March k12<br>Results: 1st choice March, 2nd Toyota BB, 3rd Citron C3.<br>Look at it the winner, it has both a euro design car + a Japanese engine.<br>How abt a Renault + NissanÂ… east meets west concept.<br>Nice outlook by Renault and pretty good Japanese engine to give the car a heart ! Lastly you pay the price of a Japanese car...<br><br>sorry dudeÂ… long story. cheers<br></div>

It happened again this morning as i came to a halt at a traffic junction - after travelling for about 20 mins with stops in between.<br><br>This time round, i got out of the car to have a look - the exhaust pipe area was vibrating much more violently than usual with "clink clink clink" sounds.Well, the guys from TC came down and had it driven to the workshop 'cos i wasn't sure about driving it down in that state.They did some ECC thingy and found no roots for that problem.The mechanic had the 4 ignition coils changed though, for fear of "dunno-what's misfiring".He also told me stuff about the marchie too -hmmm....dunno if i should mention here..maybe as private messages if you're interested...<br><br>Has anyone else had the same problem as  mine?I'm driving with fear of "it" happening again leh...<br><br>(Anyway,side-track abit....i can't join you guys at the bbq in May - i'll be ohaiyo-ing in Tokyo, hehe. You guys have fun!)</div></blockquote>Hi speechie,<br>I got that few times before too.. it happened once when i started up the car in the morning, the whole car seems to be shaking..it sounded as though something is stuck in the exhuast pipe...but when checked at TC, they din't detect the problem..</div>
