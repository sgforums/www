            <div class='col-md body'>Hei...<br>juz to feedback on the Stamford's service... (our 25K service)<br>my hubby is the one who go down at Macpherson,<br>he find that their service is good as they will explain in details whether which parts need to change.<br>The person he talk to is very honest, he wouldn't ask him to change this and that, and he give a additional discount for our Nissian March members. Juz look for Mr Bee Khoon at Macpherson (but keep to ourselves).<br><br>As for the REV engine oil, after change we can feel the different immediate.<br>we can feel it is smoother and more powerful compare to the previous service at TC.<br>And also, it is quieter than before...<br>So I feel tat it is worth trying... maybe for your next service, no harm trying once...</div>

However they mention you can actually use lower octane fuel if you install the Broquet. So what Octane petrol are you pumping? The Broquet actually "upgrades" your octane level  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> . So maybe can save $$$ by pumping lower octane petrol like the 92 instead of the 95, 98 or Vpower etc.    </div></blockquote>Hi Kingmariot, currently using Shell 98. maybe i shall tryto lower to 95 to see the different. thanks for the advice...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Average shows 98 gives more mileage and vpower provides more torque. Basic street rules, always pump 20 L / 42 L. EVery L of pertrol is 1kg + -. It does make a difference, car is lighter, lesser drag and lesser petrol required.<br><br>Do the math, my half tank 20L is abt 12 km +- / per Lit.

Per 270 km of 20L + 20 reserve = 540km. So on full tank i am getting abt 540 km / 40L +-.  Try 98 shell. Or by bumping full tank at one go ! and see if your ride can achieve more. Try it on your own, this is my own car specs calulation. Try 20 L how far for 2 x tank + 20km reserved once amber appears and<br>Add together the total. At yr 3rd time you pump full and drive until the amber light appears + 20km more. See which one will give you more savers.<br><br>Another way to get yr $ worth try pump petrol at night or in the morning, you will lose abt 3%-  6% when you do it in the afternoon.

            <div class='col-md body'>my march got into an accident today, or yesterday. very sad can't sleep. not sure even to call it an accident, i hit a curb and damaged my front left tyre. It was close to 12noon and i excited CTE into braddell road going towards upper serangoon. i took the turn at the junction and was on the merge lane on the left side. just before going out of this tunnel onto the main road, i felt this very hard impact and jerk then the next thing i felt was a punctured tyre and my car was going lop sided... my heart sinked at that moment. my head was filling with OMG OMG OMG and i switch on my hazard light, slow down and stop at this bus stop probably 50m ahead. i came out of the car holding my breathe and went around from the right to the back checking at the bottom carriage, everywhere else seemed fine when finally i was on the left side and saw the punctured front left tyre. what was worst was that the tyre somehow was shifted out of place. so had this super bad feeling that don't think just by changing the tyre could save the day. went into the car and called the emergency tow hotline on nissan decal. the tow truck arrived in less then 30mins. the seasoned tow uncle surveyed the damage and told me i would hv to claim insurance, the shaft is spolit! we were heading to tanchong toa payoh when i told him i'm insured with ntuc income. he was just right in front of idac braddell and stopped immediately on the road side when he heard that. he said ntuc insurance cant go straight to tanchong, unless under AIG or the rest. must go report idac first and follow their procedures. he said no point going down toa payoh. i called toa payoh they told me to call ubi and ubi asked me to bring down the vehicle. the tow uncle suggested it's better i report at idac first since i'm there now otherwise will hv to send my injured march all over the place... i went in to idac and they said the proper procedure will be to report and do the damage assessemnt and wait for the assignment of repair workshop in 2 days time. i requested to repair at tanchong since they asked me to send down the vehicle when i called previously. very draining. think definitely will not insured with ntuc anymore. anyway, the assessment was done by end of the day and i was informed to arrange to tow my poor march to ubi follow morning for their assessment. i called ubi again and was told the repair was not guarantee to be done there if the quote were way too far for them to match that of ntuc authorised workshops. javascript:emoticon('<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">') very eventful day but i just want my march back soon and it seemed like there's more to come... sorry for this really long post hope i could go sleep now after sharing this heart breaking accident.</div>

Or its also a good time to stay up and watch the france and portugal game.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Anyway I'm on Allianz insurance after surveying some other companies and find them competitive. When I took it up then, I actually verified with them that I can send my car back to Tan Chong and they are agreeable to it. The catch is the car must be not more than 3 years old and is still under Nissan warranty. The downside is I spent some time filling in the Allianz form at TC and also making a few phone calls. Should be more convenient if the insurance company is AIG for TC. Couple of months back got a windshield crack and I insisted to Allianz that I go back to TC to change them, they are agreeable and I can claim the insurance on it with no increase in premium. Their staff is also very helpful. They got the windshield changed within half a day. So you might want to check them out. Heard too many stories about NTUC Income for car insurance so never even consider them. Hope you get back your car soon.</div>
