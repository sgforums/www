This avoids Nissan from voiding your warranty later because some outside contractor messed up your wirings.  Nissan has a in-house supplier for most of their non-factory electronics called Ah Heng.<br><br>The March comes with Alarm in any case.

Should i consider making cushion covers?<br><br>Thanks guys</div></blockquote>Nissan sells the Ultramax film.  The specs look decent but the best part is the price = $270 nett.  VKool and Huper Optik can run up to $1000 depending on package.  IMHO, better get Nissan to do it, so they won't later void your warranty.<br><br>Since the Comfort version has no in-seat airbags, it should be no problem refurbishing them.  I'm getting mine in early Nov, and plan to use them until cannot tahan, then maybe install leather seats (should be about $1k).  I'm having the steering wheel wrapped in matching blue leather with cream stitching (SE paying for it).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

When we bargain off a few thousand from the price we feel we get a good deal. if SE dun give u any discount or freebies buyers will think the SE is not sincere, we feel we bought something expensive! So is very difficult to standrd the price. Some SE will give all his/her margin if they need to hit their target.<br><br>Seller always hope to sell higher to make more profit and we buyer always like to buy cheaper. This is a human nature! So most important is SE must treat u well and give u good service, no point buying something cheap but  SE give u lousy service which cause lot of unhappiness and touble right?<br><br>So guys out there if really want to buy any new nissan march or any car,u guys can contact me, it might not be very cheap but at least i got confident that able to get a reasonable price and freebies for u! i got good relationship with them. Becos everyday my job scope need to deal with new car agent.<br><br>Hope i did not offend people out there. Just sound out from a SE point of view and feelings.

Different day, different SE, different branch, different price, different freebies.<br><br>I just called today the Ubi branch.  First quote is $47.8k.  Then I said I heard it can be cheaper.  Immediately, ok $46.8k can.  Then I ask for further discount.  She asks whether I own a Nissan because got $500 discount if buying another Nissan.  I said No, then she said is ok, can still give $500 discount.  Then I push some more.  She say ok, lowest is $46k.  So I told her I will think about it.<br><br>This is just crazy.  If the price is $46k, then why quote $47.8k?  So inexperienced and uninformed car buyers will pay $47.8k or even higher?  People who know and push pay $46k or less?

The distinctive double bubble silhouette still looks like a cross between a classic Volkswagen Beetle and a fluffy cloud.<br><br>Matching the car's Ice Blue exterior, the designers quite literally 'blue' up the cabin.<br><br>Everything inside - from the part fabric, part suede upholstery to the dashboard to even the wiper stalks - is coloured like blueberry-flavoured cotton candy, if ever there was one.<br><br>Depending on the exterior colour, there is a beige-on-beige option for more conservative customers.<br><br>In this 1.4E trim, the car is very well equipped, almost exceedingly so.<br><br>Gizmos like powered folding mirrors, auto headlights, 15-inch alloy wheels, smart key and digital climate control with integrated air ioniser don't distract from the fact that this is essentially a really cool shopping trolley for four, with a rather tiny boot.<br><br>Except that shopping trolleys don't tool around with nearly as much verve as the March. It leaps off the line effortlessly like a bunny in heat.<br><br>The electric power steering feels like it's filled with helium but the turn-in is incisive, followed with good progression as the front-end starts to run out of grip.<br><br>Its relatively generous wheelbase and soft suspension gives the car a cushy ride but manages to suppress almost all body roll and any mid-corner bobbing.<br><br>Despite its camp (and some even say, frivolous) looks, this car drives well, better than the Honda Jazz and matching the Suzuki Swift.<br><br>The March 1.4E is not cheap though. For the money, you could bag a Nissan Sunny with cash to spare.
