(correct me if i'm wrong)</div></blockquote>It depends a lot on your driving style.  Most cars today including our March has an ECU that controls the engine, based on variables such as air/engine temp, engine speed, air density, how hard you accelerate.  If you step hard, then the ECU will think you are requesting more power and so will either kick down the gear or upshift later (i.e. staying in 3rd).  If you drive lighter, it will upshift faster because it thinks you are just cruising.<br><br>Yes, higher gear gives better FC.  But you need to tell the ECU that's what you want.  Otherwise, it might think you want more power...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

It is likely from the 3rd party vendor, who may or may not be around in 10 years, and even if so, they may not answer your phone call.<br><br>Personally, I think the days of rusting car body is history.

The stock suspension is quite soft. </div></blockquote>Our March comes with 14" wheels, unless you get the Elegance version which is 15".  This car was designed as a comfortable runabout city car, so will have softer suspension.  I actually find the car very relaxing to drive on Singapore roads because of the softness and super-powered assisted steering wheel.  I can make turns with 2 fingers on the wheel!<br><br>That however is not good for sporty driving, which require sharper and tighter steering, harder and lower suspension for cornering, and of course more power.<br><br>A quick and economical fix is to change to 16" alloys.  It will fill up the wheel arches more and give better handling.  Ride will be harder, and there will be more wear &amp; tear on the shocks because there is less rubber to cushion the bumps and so the shocks have to do all the cushioning.  Of course, they are under warranty, so if the shocks fail (i.e. leaking or soft) then get them replaced before year 3 is over!<br><br>By the way, based on the UK Micra forum, the 16" tyre size is 185/50R16 (16x6j rims).  If you want to "go all the way", then can try 205/40R17 (17x7j rims) but be ready for a really bumpy ride as you're practically riding on metal as there's little rubber...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

My gf is the one pulling the act together. I'm just along to drive there and back.<br><br>I'll look under the bonnet this Sat, and see if anything needs topping up. King Mariot has kindly advised a bottle of coolant to prepare against possible overheating.<br><br>Thank you.<br></div></blockquote>The bottle of coolant is not going to help if your car overheats.  First, you can't even open the coolant tank because the hot steam will burn anyone nearby and scald the engine (coolant can be corrosive on the rubber/plastic parts).  The car is overheating, not because there is not enough coolant, but it's simply overworked.<br><br>Note that coolant cannot be added directly into the coolant tank.  It is sold as a "concentrate" and must be diluted with distilled water (I think it's 60 water, 40 coolant) before pouring in.  Otherwise, it's too corrosive for the engine block.<br><br>Just stop the engine for 30 minutes to let the car cool down is your best option in case of overheating...<br><br>Note that overheating is more likely at higher altitudes (like Genting/Camerons) because the boiling point of liquids is lower due to the lower air pressure.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shooting_Cloud:</div><div class="quote_body">Our March comes with 14" wheels, unless you get the Elegance version which is 15".  This car was designed as a comfortable runabout city car, so will have softer suspension.  I actually find the car very relaxing to drive on Singapore roads because of the softness and super-powered assisted steering wheel.  I can make turns with 2 fingers on the wheel!<br><br>That however is not good for sporty driving, which require sharper and tighter steering, harder and lower suspension for cornering, and of course more power.<br><br>A quick and economical fix is to change to 16" alloys.  It will fill up the wheel arches more and give better handling.  Ride will be harder, and there will be more wear &amp; tear on the shocks because there is less rubber to cushion the bumps and so the shocks have to do all the cushioning.  Of course, they are under warranty, so if the shocks fail (i.e. leaking or soft) then get them replaced before year 3 is over!<br><br>By the way, based on the UK Micra forum, the 16" tyre size is 185/50R16 (16x6j rims).  If you want to "go all the way", then can try 205/40R17 (17x7j rims) but be ready for a really bumpy ride as you're practically riding on metal as there's little rubber...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>Thank you all for your replies.

Firstly is to change the horn.  This is actually a big safety issue because the March gets bullied on the road a lot.  With a pip squeak sounding horn, nobody will care.  Change to a nice pair of Stebel Magnums will make a world of difference.  It is so loud that other drivers will think it's a lorry behind them, and stop to give way.  The cost is only about $20 plus maybe $10 installation charge.<br><br>The 2nd upgrade is the light bulbs.  Philips has these extra bright bulbs that fits our March.  The procedure for replacing the headlight bulbs is in the manual and I did it myself in 10 min.  Just pull out and replace.  It's the same wattage so won't cause any problems for the electrical system.  The extra brightness makes it easier on the eyes, and more noticeable by other cars.  Cost is about $40 a pair.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
