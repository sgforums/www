So no need to explain too much. We have known the group for almost 2 years now and the phrase "only time will tell" is very apt here. Totally agree with you what you've said about raging exchanges and keeping the PEACE and its really heartbreaking but guess sometimes silence is not golden. Just look back at the posts you know what I mean. Anyway in a dynamic group, there are different personalities with different background, so there bound to be different opinions and different expectations and beliefs. Thats why we are all different. But we strongly believe in keeping the cohesiveness within the group but some might not have similar orientation and agenda. We are here to enjoy the company, make friends and share information and that is still our objective. We are definitely not here to bicker.  So when you free, it has been some time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
