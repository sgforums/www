Well there are also a few issues regarding shifting it to the center. It will definitely look nice with a add on back bumper to "wrap it around" but if yours is the original back piece, it might look a bit funny.<br><br>There are defintely some exhaust system that is compliant to LTA like a Remus type or HKS for the K12. I might be wrong so do get them confirmed before doing anything. Well there are a few shops in Ubi Road 1 which do that, so you might want to check them out.</div>

Is true is the cheapest but there is a hiden value that cost the car so cheap! The OMV value of ur Elegance model is onli about $13,000 mean ur parf value is lower and lower OMV value declared means Tan Chong motors pay lesser tax.  COE value drop which i mention earlier becos the number of booking for new car is not much.<br><br><a href="http://www.cardomain.com/ride/2475838" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardomain.com/ride/2475838</a></div>

Becos lucky u didn't buy before the COE bid. if not it going to cost u more. $51,800 for a elegance model, is the cheapest throughout the history. Becos the declare lower OMV at about $13,000. The OMV for elegance model use to be about $15k to $16K.<br><br>Ok i think $8000 can do a very good system still can include soundproof! depend on what type of music u like to enjoy.  Do u need a dvd touchscreen? Sound system can cost u $20k to $30k for those very high end stuff!  Maybe see when u took ur car we can visit the workshop together that i done my sound system!becos i want to do my soundproof! so one short do together can get better discount! They r very professional They won many awards and price quite resonable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><a href="http://www.cardomain.com/ride/2475838" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardomain.com/ride/2475838</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>$8000 for a sound system?!  Wow, to really enjoy that you will need to do major sound proofing.  I have decided to opt out of the standard stereo (so $250 discount), and picked the JVC 2-DIN stereo with 12-CD changer setup that comes with the Latio Premium (cost is $530, installed by Nissan).<br><br>How is the pick-up of the March (if possible compared to the Vios)?  Those that went to Camerons (nice pics!), how was the drive up the steep windy road from Tapah?  FC?<br><br>On my current Vios (manual trans), I changed the air filter to KNN, horn to Stebel Magnum, and wheels to 205/40R16 Potenza GIII.  Engine could breathe much better (so go faster whoopee!), people actually took notice when I honked instead of wondering who farted, and the wet grip and cornering stability was unbelievable (cornering at 90kmh no problem).  FC was about 13.5km/l which was so so due to the fat tyres.  Others could get 15km/l on stock 14" tyres.<br><br>Just curious what your experience has been with the March?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
