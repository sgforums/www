Although I would be very surprised if TC returned your deposit.  Car sales are so slow now, they probably would have struck a deal with you (maybe more freebies in exchange for top-up).<br><br>There are just a few leather suppliers in Singapore.  The main 2 are Jackspeed and Tomo.  I did my Vios at Tomo and it was a very good job at $250 for steering wheel and gear knob.  The steering wheel in the March is actually fine without leather wrap as it's quite good quality plastic, unlike the Vios which was cheap sticky rubbery stuff.  I decided not to wrap my March steering because the leather guys can't match the blue color.<br><br>I upgraded my stereo to the JVC double-din unit, plus the matching CD changer.

It's the sherry silver showroom 1.4e at 56.5k. Dealer did give me cash discount on car and solar film and reverse sensor (my friend said small car no backside sense what?). but what is kick plate? does the undercarriage need a tough coat? agent said i can do that for $385 now. after car leaves showroom it'll be double the price. Is it necessary?</div></blockquote>Don't know about you guys, but I can't do without a reverse sensor for any car.  At that price you should get the solar film and reverse sensor free.  They cost $200 and $100 respectively only.  Don't think you need the tough coat for the undercarriage.  However you may want to consider a teflon-based Tough SHield coating on your car.  The paint job is generally very good from the factory but with the tough coat, you don't have to worry about bird shit, tree and road tar, and scratching your car.  The coating is like glass - transparent but very hard so you can rub off any stain without worry of scratching the paint.<br><br>The main other items that you will consider upgrading are your tyres and stereo.  These will cost a bit of money though...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Just get in the car and drive anywhere.  They have just started selling the March there so your car will be quite unique.  The main worries in Malaysia are (i) crime, (ii) road directions, and (iii) speed traps.<br><br>Driving a March helps as people won't think you're a filthy rich Singaporean.  Dressing VERY casually is in my opinion the best defense.  No jewelry, fancy watch, etc.  Just shorts and T-shirt and you'll blend right in as that is standard attire in Malaysia.  Your car also should be safe as they target Fortuners, Camrys, and all SUVs as the main resale market is Thailand.<br><br>Road directions should be straightforward for you as you are going on the NS highway mostly, but if it is your first time driving in Malaysia, let me just say the road signs are "best guesses" so don't believe everything the sign says unlike Singapore signs.  The signs can sometimes point right then 50 meters away point left.  It's best to get a national road map from the Malaysia Tourist office on Robinson Road.  You can also get immigration cards, and other useful info.<br><br>Speed traps are common along the NS highway, although with the March, it shouldn't be too much of a problem since it can't go that fast anyway.  Northern Johor is very common - seems like the police there likes the "additional income".  In the unfortunate event of getting stopped by TP, they will try to get you to pay them off - the standard is RM50 so please don't get "cheated" and pay more simply because you are from Singapore.  However, I usually just ask them for the summon.  That's because many of these speed traps are illegal i.e. not official ones.  If it's just one police car, then very likely it's illegal, and these cops just want some extra pocket money.  If it's illegal, they can't give you a summons because they are not supposed to be there anyway.  Even if it is legal, it will be difficult to enforce as they don't know where you live and can't send you a reminder.  The only downside is if you'fre caught again, they will expect a bigger "payment", that is if they have done their homework and checked your record, which they usually don't.<br><br>Enjoy your drive.  Malaysia is a beautiful country and warm friendly people.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
