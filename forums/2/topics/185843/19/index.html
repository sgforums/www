Fifteen complaints have been lodged with the police, but each was dropped due to a lack of evidence.<br><br>But Feb 16 proved a turning point. With the help of a private investigator, a man was caught in the act - and he even admitted to his deed on camera, no less.<br><br>It had been private eye Dennis Lee's eighth night on the job, perched on a wall opposite the suspect's home and armed with a video camera.<br><br>His own car - a silver SUV - was the 'bait, parked opposite the alleged vandal's house'.<br><br>At 5.50am, the suspect came out of his house and strolled over to the car. With his sharp tool, he made a deep scratch down the length of the car.<br><br>With the video camera still recording, Mr Lee confronted him.<br><br>The man explained apologetically that when cars were parked opposite his house, it made it difficult for him to back his Mercedes-Benz C-class out of his driveway; his children's school bus also could not get through.<br><br>But the video clearly shows ample room on the two-way road.<br><br>Yesterday, the businessman was arrested at his house.<br><br>When The Straits Times called him on Friday for his response to his neighbours' allegations, he only laughed.<br><br>His neighbours say they would be disappointed if he was just charged with a minor offence of causing mischief under Section 427 of the Penal Code.<br><br>They say that his apologetic manner on camera makes him seem remorseful, but they have seen his unpleasant side.<br><br>Fashion designer Claire Heng, 28, a resident in the condo opposite, said after her car was scratched in 2004, she began parking her car one street away last year - only to find it scratched again.<br><br>When she confronted the suspect, he asked: 'What evidence do you have?'<br><br>A 35-year-old advertising designer who wants to be known only as Mr Leong, said his 11/2-year stay there was 'very unpleasant'.<br><br>His new black Ford was vandalised twice within two weeks of his moving into the condo in January 2004. The first time, super glue was poured on the bonnet. It ate into the paint.<br><br>The following week, he was making a right turn when he almost lost control of his car.<br><br>A mechanic who checked the car found the valve from his rear left tyre missing. Air had been leaking out slowly.<br><br>Although Mr Leong no longer lives there now, he, along with some other residents will be in court today.<br><br>He said he 'won't be satisfied'' until 'the person who has committed an act of vandalism'' answers for it fully.<br><br>For the news clip, Go to ST Interactive at www.straitstimes.com. Also see the video on Stompcast.<br>Don't miss this dramatic clip of a car scratcher caught in the act. This video was shot by private investigator Dennis Lee of Covert Acquisition, who was hired by a group of residents in Eastwood Road. It shows their neighbour scratching an SUV in the early morning of Feb 16. Based on the tape, the man will be charged in court (Aug <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> with one count of causing mischief.<br><br>dammmmmmmm people like him, got a merc n gave all funny reasons!!!!!!He claimed that other cars are blocking his road....`HIS ROAD'...when does the public road becomes his? He could have videotaped those cars that becomes an obstruction to public users (pedestrian &amp; motorists) and provide evidence to the relevant authorities.think he should tell the court that he had brain damage frm damaging so many cars!!!!!!!!!</div>
