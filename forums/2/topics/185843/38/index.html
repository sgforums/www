Just some correction, the record of 26 Marchies was set during last Christmas gathering at NUS in 2005 not 2004 and the first meet up is at West Coast Macs not Kallang...Maybe you spend too much time in the "not so bright side" time to get some light.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Sounds rather familiar?<br><br>Well you must be right as most meetups were on Saturdays. 1st meet up was BEFORE your time at West Coast lah, you might not have collected your car yet. When you meet us in West Coast that was not the first time we met...Anyway that is history.<br><br>Aiyoh you still whinning about the founder thingy? You are the one who CANNOT fulfill your so called MOTO. You are the one who started this stock vs non stock thing so dun try and pretend its not you as there are many who knows the history. We always believe a March is a March regardless of what the colour and what things you have done to your car. Dunno who kept going on and on about blacksheeps and the nursery rhymes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Why dun you tell me when YOU are ready to be united. We are always open and don't ostracised anyone and we don't conduct any "secretive" meetups which is kept from interested party like myself. Maybe the term secretive and "not so bright side"goes hand in hand or really there are other agendas?</div>
