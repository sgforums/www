Mineral oil is free (part of the free service) but synthetic must top $60 (I think).  Synthetic oil is preferred as it does a better job of lubrication, and can even save petrol because your engine has less power loss due to friction.  Also it lasts longer so your next service can be 20k.  So it's worth it to take synthetic oil.<br><br>Even if they ask you to sign up to their service plan, it's really up to you whether you want.  Personally I did the calculations and there is actually not much savings, but it locks you in so you can't go somewhere else like Autosaver or your nearby petrol station for servicing.  I decided not to sign up so that I have the flexibility.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Repair is essentially grinding off the scratch which isn't perfect.  Shops usually replace rims in a set, unless you go to a rim specialist who may have an extra one lying around.<br><br>If you really cannot stand the scratch, try calling Poh Heng (Justin) 98368640 to check if they have your rim (tell him it's the stock ones).  Shouldn't cost more than $50 as it's used and nobody wants these 15" rims (people want big sports rims).<br><br>IMO, just get used to it.

They can't just respray the scratch.<br><br>For me, I just live with the scratches.  Most of the debris can be gently washed off (be careful not to rub too hard and use lots of water because the particles will scratch your paint further!), and some polish may help.  Sometimes I DIY apply some touch up paint which you can get from TC (better from TC so the paint matches exactly).

Most of the debris can be gently washed off (be careful not to rub too hard and use lots of water because the particles will scratch your paint further!), and some polish may help.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah saw the pink version! wanted to get that at first but the bumper didnt look as good as the 2006 series to me. so in the end i bought the 2006 air blue one. I didnt like the caocao interior. Singapore choice very limited, if u go to the japan website they can customise the interior. and there are 25years anniversary colors but singapore dun bring in... the limited strip one did u see? wahh i like that one man! looks very limited edition. the Chocolate version oso looks good. White one looks good also but interior is caocao...</div>
