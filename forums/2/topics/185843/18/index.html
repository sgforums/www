What are the main lubrication problems in passenger car engines?. </span></strong><br><br>Most Lubrication problems for passenger car engines fall primarily into the following areas:<br><br>Â•Low-temperature or light-duty operation. This is when a car makes a lot of short trips that never allow the engine to reach its optimum operating temperature. Partially burned fuel byproducts can result in sludge deposits and excessive rust.<br>Â•High-temperature oxidation. Engine operating temperatures today are extremely high while the amount of oil in the sump is small, as little as four quarts. This severe heat stress on the oil can accelerate oil oxidation, resulting in oil thickening, loss of lubricating properties, varnish and piston deposits.<br>Â•Passenger car engines deliver high horsepower in relation to the size and weight of engine components. This places great stress on engine parts such as the valvetrain, which strains to provide the high cam lift and spring loads required for efficiency and high engine speeds.<br>Â•The use of air-pollution control devices such as positive crankcase ventilation and exhaust gas recirculation can increase the heat stress on an oil and increase the amount of contaminants in the oil.<br><br>2. How can I be sure I'm getting high-quality oil?<br><br>Ok, Throughout the world there are many differences in the oils. In general, name brand oil meets or exceeds automobile manufacturer specifications, industry standards and governmental regulations. Users should use the type of oil recommended in their vehicle handbook/owners manual or an oil that claims to be approved by the manufacturer of their vehicle. After this, owners may look to an industry standard, such as from JASO, ACEA or API, for guidance. The licenses ILSAC Certification Mark or "starburst symbol" to be placed on the front of oil bottles, certifying that those oils are the appropriate oil for gasoline-powered passenger cars, light trucks, minivans and SUVs.<br><br>(After 10k )<br>Fuel economy savings for Fully Synthetic<br>0W Â– 30 Enhances engine performance and power<br>0W - 40 Ensures engine is protected from wear and deposit build-up<br>5W Â– 40 Ensures good cold starting and quick circulation in freezing temperatures<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Preference choices:<br>Shell Hylix (5 - 40 ) or Mobil One (0 -30) (USA version, can find at Care4) </strong></span><br><br>Gets to moving parts of the engine quickly<br><br>( Optional after 5k onwards ) is better than mineral oil<br>Semi- Synthetic<br>5W- 30 Better protection<br>10W- 40 Good protection within the first 10 minutes after starting out<br>15W- 40 Roughly three times better at reducing engine wear<br>Increased oil change intervals - don't need to change it quite so often<br><br>Mineral oil ( TC recommend, becos is cheap free service 1, 5, 10 k )<br>10W Â– 40 Basic protection for a variety of engines<br>15W Â– 40 Oil needs to be changed more often<br><br>Engines pump about 10,000 litres of air for every litre of fuel consumed, and along with all that air, they suck in plenty of dirt and grit. A good air filter will stop everything bigger than a micron in diameter - everything smaller mostly just floats around harmlessly in the 0.001inch minimum thickness oil films that separate all the moving parts. Despite all of this, there will always be submicron particles that get in and there will be places in the engines oilways where they will gather. Every time you empty the oil from your sump, you're also draining this fine grit with it.<br><br>Tyres PSI.<br>Are you running on stock rims 14 or 15 inch.<br>Some tips.<br><strong><br><span style="color: blue;">Normal stock tyres Front (220 or 230) Rear (210 or 220)<br>A) Sedom carry load ( F 220- R 210 )<br>B) Always ferry and carry load ( F 230 - R 220 )</span></strong><br><br>For more question send me a PM or email: micrarider@yahoo.com<br><span style="color: blue;"></span>[/b]</blockquote><span style="color: blue;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello guys,<br><br>I'm thinking of getting a March and I have been visiting the nissan website quite often.<br><br>I'm intending to visit the showroom soon and am preparing myself for it. I have 1-2 questions which I hope some of you can help with.<br><br>The listed price found here.<br><a href="http://%20http://www.nissan.com.sg/lookfor/march/march_price.cfm." rel="nofollow"> http://www.nissan.com.sg/lookfor/march/march_price.cfm. </a><br><br>How much will this veer from the SE's quote?<br><br>Further, I see min. COE bid amt of 1k. Does this mean that the price listed here is not inclusive of COE bid price? In this case, should I add another 9k to illustrate the impact of COE price?<br><br>I know it sounds premature to ask this questions because by the time I visit the showroom, I'll probably have it all straight from the horse's mouth.<br><br>Thanks alot<br></div>

BTW I remembered last Sunday while i was at Ang Mo Kio area i saw a group of March. Looks interesting with all the vibrant colours. Some looked "done up" and some look quite "fierce". Wonder if they are from here. Interesting to see so many of them at the same time. Must be going to some function. What stuffs do you guys do here beside chatting in the forum? Is there any other March forum?</div>
