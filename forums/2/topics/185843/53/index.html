A self-levelling system automatically adjusts the lights so they do not point higher than they should.<br><br>'We will consult the industry before making any decision to implement this,' an LTA spokesman said.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that the main cause of complaints are illegally modified headlamps which, like other illegal modifications, can draw a fine of up to $1,000 or a jail term of up to three months for first offenders.<br><br>Many consumers are unaware that many parallel importers sell their cars with these illegal fittings.<br><br>Surveyor Hermanto Kassanri, 35, was shocked when he found that the Honda Stream seven-seater he bought three months ago had these illegal fittings.<br><br>'I discovered this when I went to the workshop for servicing. My mechanic pointed out that the car's headlights were illegal,' he said. 'It's worrying.'<br><br>Another Honda Stream owner, renovation agent Kamil F.S., 32, said he found out about his illegal lights through an online car forum. 'I will go back to the importer and see what can be done,' he said.<br><br>Mr Neo Nam Heng, president of the parallel importers' Automotive Importers and Exporters Association, said 'all importers should be aware of and compliant to all rules and technical requirements'.<br><br>But industry sources say many parallel importers 'bend' these rules.<br><br>Pinnacle Motors admitted that it had sold cars fitted with the illegal HID lamps, but said it was taking steps to rectify that.<br><br>Its managing director Larry Teo told The Straits Times that he would 'recall' all the cars and replace them with the original headlights.<br><br>He said his company had sold 'over 100'' of such cars, mainly Hondas and Toyotas. 'It's a competitive market and we're not the only ones doing it. We meant no harm,'' he said, adding that 'our laws are not advanced'.<br><br>HID lamps fitted by parallel importers are not the only kind making motorists squint. Some cars sold by authorised agents too can be blinding.<br><br>This can happen when the rear of the vehicle is heavily loaded, thereby lifting its nose. The slight tilt in angle is enough to get the HID light into the eyes of other drivers.<br><br>Which is why the LTA is looking to implement the self-levelling device requirement - which is mandatory in Europe.<br><br>For those who bought cars with illegal modifications, the LTA advises them to keep documentation proof.<br><br>'They will have to give a statement and provide evidence, such as the sales agreement to the investigation officer,' the spokesman said. 'Appropriate action will be taken against the culpable party who caused the offence.'<br><br></div>

If you are doing after-market ones, you need to have proof that it is legal and would pass inspection (if not, you are asking for it). Changing the color itself is ok but make sure that you don't exceed the voltage rating or you may cause a meltdown of the mountings or worse, cause a electrical problem that could cause fire.

Both recalls (for Latio and March) in this instance are not safety related and therefore there is no cause for alarm.<br><br>Hope this answers your queries.

A self-levelling system automatically adjusts the lights so they do not point higher than they should.<br></div></blockquote>Just to clarify, there are HID and Halogen lightbulbs.  HID are far brighter (about 50%) and so require self-levelling device to make sure the light is always pointed at the right angle and doesn't blind other drivers.  Most cars for export which have HID will also have the self-levelling device factory fitted.  However, the PI cars don't have the self-leveller because it is not required in Japan.  Also some PI locally install the HID to improve the sale price which is illegal.<br><br>HID usually look white.  These are the 3000K to 4000K lights.  The number refers to the light "temperature".  Without going into the technical details, slightly different mix of gases will create different colors.  6000K is blueish.<br><br>Halogen bulbs are the standard for cars now.  Almost no car comes with the old tungsten filament bulbs anymore.  Halogen bulbs are slightly yellow.  However, there are some that are white such as Philips Diamond bulbs.  Note that the Diamond bulb is LESS bright than stock.  Philips also has the extra bright Halogen bulbs (about 20% more I think) at the same 55W rating.  These are what I'm using.  ALL Halogen bulbs are ok by LTA rules which only specifies that the replacement bulb wattage is the same as stock.<br><br>The funny thing is that HID is about 35W only as it uses diferent technology than Halogen...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I park it out in the open under the hot sun at least twice a week and the seats feel real sticky and hot when I get into the car.<br><br>Realise also that it takes quite a long while before the seats cool down. But 1k++ is a lot for covering the seats hor...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> </div></blockquote>The first decision is full or half or split leather.  There is also 100% synthetic leather like the ones used by some taxis.  Split leather is where they take the full leather and split it in half, and sometimes into 4 thin pieces.  As it is too weak to stand on its own, it is bonded with a synthetic layer i.e. "bonded leather".  The thin natural leather will tear/flake over time and you'll see creases and lines on the leather.  If you've got a old cheap bonded leather belt, you'll know what I mean.<br><br>Half leather is where the front of the seat is 100% full leather while the back of the seats which our backside doesn't touch is synthetic leather i.e. PVC.  This is not too bad and better than the split leather.  Usually the door panels are also synthetic leather.<br><br>Full leather is 100% natural leather.  Here the choice is between grades of leather.  Italian and German leather are better quality and more expensive.  Most of shops here get their leather from Thailand.  It's not that the Italian cows are healthier, but the processing requires high technology and experience which the Italians have.  In fact most of the Italian leather comes from other countries and are processed in Italy.  Also there is Nappa leather (the soft kind that is used in Lexus cars) which are even more expensive.  German cars have tougher leather (that's how the germans like it...).<br><br>I did my previous car at Tomo leather which is located next to the main Mazda showroom in Kampong Ampat.  They do most of the leather for Mazda cars, so you can check out their workmanship at the Mazda showroom.  They use 100% full leather, but you can choose either half or full (but no split leather).  Full leather is about $1k.  Half is about $750.  You may have to leave your car there for a few days, unless they already have the March measurements i.e. some other Marchie has got it done there before.<br><br>Jackspeed is a bit cheaper but the use Thai leather which are not as durable.  They are the in-house vendor for Tan Chong.<br><br>The last thing to note is that there are not that many colors to choose from.  For example there is no Air Blue comparable, which is the main reason I'm still on the fabric seats in my Marchie...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Cooling down was bearable though, takes a bit of time.<br><br>Matching the car colour with leather is challenging, however i feel it all depends on individual's preference.<br><br>Overall was quite please with the look, maintenance wise. Occasion cleaning i believe should be sufficient. Apply Leather cleaner and conditioner once a while helps to nourish the leather though.</span></div>
