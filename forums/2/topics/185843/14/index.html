(no offence to all, just a joke)<br>On Broquet, the agent is willing to give a 30 day money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product. Ie you will only lose about $30, being the costs of the installation if you want your money back. On top of that there is a 10% discount if you buy before July 30th (correct me if I am wrong)<br><br>The economics are simple as the agent says you will have a 10 % savings in fuel usage. If your monthly petrol bill is $300, 10% is $30 pm =$360 pa =free Broquet after 1 year.<br><br>Personally I am interested and hope that we can get a bigger discount if we go 'en-bloc'. So who's interested to go with me? Those who want to get their money back before 1 month can do so. Ie the guarantee need not be done 'en-bloc'.<br><br>There was also a HEPA standard filter selling for about $40+, customised to fit our Marchies. Since this is cheaper than that offered by Nissan (at $80+) and better, I think my conclusion is obvious.<br><br>The best reason for using or changing interior air filters is to look at the used air filters themselves.<br><br>I am sorry for this long post but I need to run many errands now. I will continue with the other products later. Perhaps those of you who were present  can also contribute, at least those who ate the cheesecake, since I had none (still grieving).<br><br>Peace man. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Toadie</div></blockquote>Hi Toadie,<br><br>thks for all the updates. v good information to share with the rest of marchies. cheers<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The last statement is of course correct but will the 'fan' be able to 'churn' the mixture is still debatable.

Maybe you should give a talk yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Also realised you end of your posting with Peace.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I got a friend who got a Mr Lim to do a colonscopy on his car, basically he shaft a plastic material (looks like cable tie) into his air/fuel line <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">.  But that was at least 5 years back. This fella actually works from his car. Wonder if that is E power. It must have evolved over these years.<br><br>Anyway the Hurricane I have in my car is a drop in filter and not a fan. The filtration efficiency for smaller particles is definitely lower than the stock filters. The compensating factor will be more "breathable" air into the engine. But again more particles will be ingested into the engine resulting in dirtier engine oil, more friction to the moving parts? Have not taken out the filter and clean it though but I got a spare stock filter just in case I need it. Also realise that the stock filter is also coated with "oil" as it oozes out after I left it in the boot for a few days. Anyway the resulting effect is subjective. I cannot ascertain the diffierence or can actually quantify it. Fuel consumption actually decreases a bit and I was doing 13km/l after installing it, down from 13km/l plus to 14km/l which I used to do.<br><br>Regarding the magnets, I am skeptical as well but there are some Marchies which swears by it after installing them. Gives them better "power" and improve fuel consumption. One of them even think of installing more magnets. So I got a friend to pass me his magnet and put them on just to do the experiment. Results from 1st, 2 tanks of Ron 95, I am hitting about close to 14km/l (no significant diff from before) and 3rd tank of Ron92 hitting close to 15km/l. Weird, better fuel consumption? Will continue to monitor other tanks and keep you posted. Anyway from a qualitative observation, the drive seemed smoother and feels more powerful. Maybe its time to clear carbon the manual way again. Any takers?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

The filtration efficiency for smaller particles is definitely lower than the stock filters. The compensating factor will be more "breathable" air into the engine. But again more particles will be ingested into the engine resulting in dirtier engine oil, more friction to the moving parts? Have not taken out the filter and clean it though but I got a spare stock filter just in case I need it. Also realise that the stock filter is also coated with "oil" as it oozes out after I left it in the boot for a few days. Anyway the resulting effect is subjective. I cannot ascertain the diffierence or can actually quantify it. Fuel consumption actually decreases a bit and I was doing 13km/l after installing it, down from 13km/l plus to 14km/l which I used to do.<br><br>The oil that oozes out from stock air filter is engine oil that was cause by backfire.<br>When diy install stock air filter only smear some oil or greas on the side of the fliter.<br><br>well it good to give our "city cars" a good road tune in m'sia</div>

You also observe a lot of oil stains? Actually the oozing I am refering to is from brand new stock filters. Think they are also coated with oil based substance to trap dust.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And yes it is good to tune the car up North.

However they mention you can actually use lower octane fuel if you install the Broquet. So what Octane petrol are you pumping? The Broquet actually "upgrades" your octane level  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> . So maybe can save $$$ by pumping lower octane petrol like the 92 instead of the 95, 98 or Vpower etc.</div>

Interesting, you are not the first to say that the magnets work on our March. Maybe can monitor a few full tanks and share with us your experience, driving habits, highway to city driving ratio, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
