            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Marchies!<br><br>Wow, just read the article on the Nismo-tuned March on the last page of March Club Part V....drool factor 10/10!!! I like....NYCMicra, possible to do in JB? Any idea how big a hole it will burn in my pocket? Sighz...prob can't afford it anyway... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Anyway, reason I'm posting today is to share my experience on a topic that should be close to all drivers' hearts...petrol! Yes, prices have shot up recently, and I believe some of us are starting to feel the pinch every time we fill up at our favourite petrol kiosk. So much so that some of us have resorted to filling up with 92 octane...well, according to some people, the performance of your car doesn't depend on what grade of petrol you use, as long as its not below the recommended octane level. In fact, some even say that using a higher grade than what's recommended may even be detrimental to your car's engine.<br><br>I would like to share with you a personal experiment I conducted recently, which may change your mind about using higher grade petrol.<br><br>When I first got my March, I had this notion that I must give it the best treatment (new car mah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), so I pumped V-Power, cos I had some friends who drive WRXs and they swear that Shell has the best quality petrol. I was pumping V-Power for quite some time before someone actually questioned me whether there was any difference between V-Power and say, 98, and whether it was worth paying the extra 10 cents per litre. Well, I thought why not try it out and see for myself? Shell has always promoted its highest grade of petrol as giving you better mileage and more vrooom to your ride, so it would be interesting to see if it really lives up to its name.<br><br>The next time I went to fill up, I pumped a full tank of 98, and waited to see what difference there was. What I wanted to see was whether there was any difference in the pick up, as well as whether my FC would be affected. My average mileage per full tank of V-Power was about 440km, not much because apparantly my engine still wasn't broken in yet according to some friends, but that worked out to about 12-13km/l which was quite reasonable to me (Jazz is supposed to be the most fuel efficient car in its class at 14km/l).<br><br>What I experienced on that tank of 98 was quite surprising...there really was a marked difference in the pick up of my car, throttle response was sluggish and the car felt rather heavy despite me being the only passenger most of the time. Not only that, the starting of the engine actually took a few seconds longer on cold starts, not good. The next observation made me even more shocked, my odometer read only about 380km when the yellow light came on! That's a difference of about 60km, for the same amount of petrol used. Ok, I thought to myself, there must be some reason to explain all this...maybe when you use a different grade the computer chip makes some changes to the car...hang on, V-Power is the same grade as 98...maybe the mixing of the full tank of 98 with the little bit of V-Power that I had left somehow reduced the effectiveness of the petrol...unlikely...maybe I drove more aggressively with this tank, or had to step harder on the pedal cos it picked up so damn slowly....ya that must be it. Well, only one way to find out...pump another tank of 98 just to be sure.<br><br>Sure enough, throttle response remained sluggish, and mileage improved only slightly, this time made it to 400km with some light-footed driving. But that's still 40km short of my average with V-Power...almost equivalent to half a notch on my fuel meter! And all this just to save 10 cents per litre? Ok, no question about it, I'm switching back to V-Power. And let me tell you, the response I got after switching back was absolutely tangible, you can actually feel the engine's perkiness gradually returning as you leave the petrol kiosk. That itself is worth the extra $4-$5 per tank in my opinion. And my mileage went back to 440-450, so it was all good. I was pumping V-Power all the way, until recently when the prices shot up by 10 cents per litre. V-Power is now past the $2 per litre mark. Pumping 98 is now equivalent to pumping V-Power a month ago. I convinced myself that I had to downgrade to 95 in order to save money, after all an article in the newspaper stated that despite what petrol companies may want you to believe, the grade of petrol you use doesn't actually change your car's performance. So I decided I would make a gradual change, starting by downgrading to 98.<br><br>No surprise, I felt the same sluggishness after the downgrade, and my mileage fell back to 400km when the yellow light appeared  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> . This time I drained as much of the tank as I dared possible and only pumped WAY after the light came on...guess what grade I pumped?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  That was just a couple of days ago, and I'm glad to say my Marchie is back to her good old self again. I guess I managed to prove to myself that, despite the additional $4-$5 per tank that I'm paying for V-Power, over 98 I might add, I'm getting:<br>1) Better pick up<br>2) Better mileage (abt 50km more per tank)<br>3) Cleaner engine (more additives, plus FMT)<br>4) 20% more Escape points, which allows me to redeem my $40 fuel discount or Free Carwash voucher faster<br>5) Free tyre shine service<br>Wow, I should be working for SHELL instead!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Anyway, I hope I didn't bore you guys with my essay keke! Wonder if any of you have the same experience with using different grades of petrol. If so, please share so that we can all benefit from it (and so that I can confirm my findings too keke!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Another longwinded tale,<br>Blade<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Blade<br><br>I used to do the same thing as you when i first got the car. However what i did was to experiment between Esso Ron 92 to 95 to 98.<br><br>First observation was that Ron 98 will give the best "power" and gives better mileage among the 3. That was until it passes the 20k mark when Ron98 does not really gives better mileage and Ron95 actually produces about the same as Ron98. Ron92 mileage is worst. As you have pointed out fuel economy is important so "power" becomes less a priority and I have stuck to basically Ron95 till now. I also experimented Vpower in Malaysia and also with Ron95 in Singapore when I travel the North South and they both gave similar mileage. So no difference to me except maybe "power" Anyway I am doing about 14+ km/l whether it is on VPower Malaysia or Ron95 from Singapore. Again there will be pple who feel that lower octane might cause "knocking" so I try to avoid Ron92, but now and then to save money I'll "sneak" it in with other mixes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Blade28:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Marchies!<br><br>Wow, just read the article on the Nismo-tuned March on the last page of March Club Part V....drool factor 10/10!!! I like....NYCMicra, possible to do in JB? Any idea how big a hole it will burn in my pocket? Sighz...prob can't afford it anyway... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Anyway, reason I'm posting today is to share my experience on a topic that should be close to all drivers' hearts...petrol! Yes, prices have shot up recently, and I believe some of us are starting to feel the pinch every time we fill up at our favourite petrol kiosk. So much so that some of us have resorted to filling up with 92 octane...well, according to some people, the performance of your car doesn't depend on what grade of petrol you use, as long as its not below the recommended octane level. In fact, some even say that using a higher grade than what's recommended may even be detrimental to your car's engine.<br><br>I would like to share with you a personal experiment I conducted recently, which may change your mind about using higher grade petrol.<br><br>When I first got my March, I had this notion that I must give it the best treatment (new car mah  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), so I pumped V-Power, cos I had some friends who drive WRXs and they swear that Shell has the best quality petrol. I was pumping V-Power for quite some time before someone actually questioned me whether there was any difference between V-Power and say, 98, and whether it was worth paying the extra 10 cents per litre. Well, I thought why not try it out and see for myself? Shell has always promoted its highest grade of petrol as giving you better mileage and more vrooom to your ride, so it would be interesting to see if it really lives up to its name.<br><br>The next time I went to fill up, I pumped a full tank of 98, and waited to see what difference there was. What I wanted to see was whether there was any difference in the pick up, as well as whether my FC would be affected. My average mileage per full tank of V-Power was about 440km, not much because apparantly my engine still wasn't broken in yet according to some friends, but that worked out to about 12-13km/l which was quite reasonable to me (Jazz is supposed to be the most fuel efficient car in its class at 14km/l).<br><br>What I experienced on that tank of 98 was quite surprising...there really was a marked difference in the pick up of my car, throttle response was sluggish and the car felt rather heavy despite me being the only passenger most of the time. Not only that, the starting of the engine actually took a few seconds longer on cold starts, not good. The next observation made me even more shocked, my odometer read only about 380km when the yellow light came on! That's a difference of about 60km, for the same amount of petrol used. Ok, I thought to myself, there must be some reason to explain all this...maybe when you use a different grade the computer chip makes some changes to the car...hang on, V-Power is the same grade as 98...maybe the mixing of the full tank of 98 with the little bit of V-Power that I had left somehow reduced the effectiveness of the petrol...unlikely...maybe I drove more aggressively with this tank, or had to step harder on the pedal cos it picked up so damn slowly....ya that must be it. Well, only one way to find out...pump another tank of 98 just to be sure.<br><br>Sure enough, throttle response remained sluggish, and mileage improved only slightly, this time made it to 400km with some light-footed driving. But that's still 40km short of my average with V-Power...almost equivalent to half a notch on my fuel meter! And all this just to save 10 cents per litre? Ok, no question about it, I'm switching back to V-Power. And let me tell you, the response I got after switching back was absolutely tangible, you can actually feel the engine's perkiness gradually returning as you leave the petrol kiosk. That itself is worth the extra $4-$5 per tank in my opinion. And my mileage went back to 440-450, so it was all good. I was pumping V-Power all the way, until recently when the prices shot up by 10 cents per litre. V-Power is now past the $2 per litre mark. Pumping 98 is now equivalent to pumping V-Power a month ago. I convinced myself that I had to downgrade to 95 in order to save money, after all an article in the newspaper stated that despite what petrol companies may want you to believe, the grade of petrol you use doesn't actually change your car's performance. So I decided I would make a gradual change, starting by downgrading to 98.<br><br>No surprise, I felt the same sluggishness after the downgrade, and my mileage fell back to 400km when the yellow light appeared  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> . This time I drained as much of the tank as I dared possible and only pumped WAY after the light came on...guess what grade I pumped?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  That was just a couple of days ago, and I'm glad to say my Marchie is back to her good old self again. I guess I managed to prove to myself that, despite the additional $4-$5 per tank that I'm paying for V-Power, over 98 I might add, I'm getting:<br>1) Better pick up<br>2) Better mileage (abt 50km more per tank)<br>3) Cleaner engine (more additives, plus FMT)<br>4) 20% more Escape points, which allows me to redeem my $40 fuel discount or Free Carwash voucher faster<br>5) Free tyre shine service<br>Wow, I should be working for SHELL instead!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Anyway, I hope I didn't bore you guys with my essay keke! Wonder if any of you have the same experience with using different grades of petrol. If so, please share so that we can all benefit from it (and so that I can confirm my findings too keke!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Another longwinded tale,<br>Blade<br></div></blockquote></div>
