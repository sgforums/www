That will take the input signal from your iPod or other MP3 player.  You will need a stereo plug on both ends.  You should be able to get this from any electronics store (Sim Lim etc.).  Carrefour may also have it (which is good because if it doesn't work you can return it...).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

So far I'm quite impressed with the service staff.  The problem with Toyota is that they are so successful and even if only a small portion of their cars come for service they are already full.  They sell 2000 cars each month, and I doubt they can handle all the cars.  So they don't even try.</div>

It went off after a month or so.  Too squeaky clean now I guess...<br><br>Rain-X has dropped in popularity now because it's side effects are worse.  It leaves a sticky residue on your wipers which over time will actually collect dirt.  Also there are other formulations which are like Rain-X but I heard that they tarnished the paint.<br><br>Just wipe with mild soapy water will do.  Also don't forget to wipe the inside of your windscreen occasionally as a thin layer of grime also collects on the inside as we usually turn on the A/C with recycled air.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Loved the car.  Sportiest car for the money paid.  Although it's only 100cc bigger engine, the power/torque is 109hp /141Nm vs. the March's 97hp /137Nm.  The weight is about the same, although the auto version is about 50kg heavier than the March.  In many developing countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines) the Vios is the main taxi vehicle.  That tells you a lot about the reliability, economy, and performance.  I drove up Cameron Highlands twice, and was overtaking most other cars with ease especially when going uphill.  The Vios' power to weight ratio is 110hp/ton and so for a new Camry that weighs 1540kg the equivalent power is 170hp (the 2.4liter Camry is 167hp).  Add to that the manual transmission, lightweight body (less rolling effect when cornering) and all-round disc brakes (better braking), it is a very strong performer.  The FC I got is about the same as I'm getting for the March i.e 12 - 13km/l but that may be because I drove the manual Vios like a sports car (16" wheels with Bridgestone Potenza GIII tyres, and KNN filter for better airflow).<br><br>Frankly the main reason I changed (and took a big loss in exporting the car) was that my wife just passed her driving and I wanted her to be able to drive as well.  She absolutely had no confidence with a manual transmission and barely passed the test (within 1 point).  However the March is a very different car and holds its own in many respects.<br><br>1.  This is the easiest car to drive I have ever tried, and I've been driving for 18 years.  It is so relaxing and low stress.  The viewing angles from the drivers seat is amazing.  You don't have to adjust the mirrors or strain your neck to reverse or parallel park because the windows/windshield are huge and the side mirrors covers a very wide area.  This has to be tried to believe.  The car was designed for Japanese ladies as a urban runaround car, so the power steering is extra boosted (you can make U turn with 2 fingers holding the wheel).  The turning radius is 4.4m compared to 4.9m for the Vios, great for those not confident in making tight U turns.<br><br>2.  It has a great balance between power and FC.  The 1.4 liter is not a race-bred animal but will certainly make you a lot more confident on the road than a 1 liter Picanto or even a 1.4liter Getz.  The usual FC is decent at 12 - 13km/l.  Drive gently and you'll hit 14km/l.<br><br>3.  The quality is in a different league from the Vios.  Everything is put together much better in Japan.  Fit and finish is tops.  No funny rattles and noises that the Vios is famous for.  The door shuts with a nice sounding thud. The switches click nicer and the plastics are soft instead of the cheap hard plastic in the Vios.  The interior light dims gradually and when you pull your key out, it comes on (again gradually) to help you get out of the car.<br><br>4.  And finally, they really went all out with the colors!  If you choose AirBlue, the interior (dashboard, steering wheel and switches, and seats) are also blue!  You'll find unique colors not available on any other car (certainly not with the Vios) like Cream and Green Pea.  It even used to have a Chocolate color.<br><br>Well enough said.  I sound like a car reviewer...  Enjoy your decision making...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Vios is an auto-transmission car and I've been driving it 20mths now.<br><br>I chose Vios because it was good value-for-money, powerful, well-known for good FC and reliable (becoz it's Japanese and Toyota). All practical, economical reasons for my decision. So far, my FC has been consistently 13-14.5km/l and yes, I do enjoy the power when I need it.<br><br>However, ever since a relative got her March and having test driven it a few times, I've fallen in love with the smooth, understated elegance and cuteness of the car. It stands out proud and elegant amongst the crowd of Vioses, Altises and Hondas in any car park. It never fails to catch my eye whenever a March whizzes along the expressway alongside mine; whatever the color.<br><br>The cute, front lamps, bright, radiant colours, cheeky curvey shape, regal height of the car all work together to command attention. Having sat in it, I've found that all fixtures and fittings are very well-placed and reasonably thought through. The ceiling cabin lamp is fitted within easy reach of the driver; the broad and wide dashboard area gives good space for tissue boxes or sunglasses. The shelf beneath the steering wheel lets you place car park coupon books or folded umbrella. The cabinet is wide enough to place necessities.<br><br>The texture of the seats scream of quality and high-class sophistication. The ability to easily fold down the backseats to enlarge the boot is also so sensible. Not to mention the wide legroom for front passenger.<br><br>Just like what you mentioned, Shooting_cloud, the steering is sooo smooth and easy that it's clearly a lady's car. All these factors have been tugging at my heartstrings and I'm just so near to deciding to sell off my Vios to get a March. *shy smile* So much for all the sensible reasons for retaining the Vios.<br><br>I'm now waiting for the end of the lockin period or when the loan interest rates drops. When that comes, I want a red beanie and I want it to standout amongst the sea of Vioses, Altises and Hondas. hahaha..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

The Vios is a lot more expensive now (in fact, a friend asked if he should get a Subaru Impreza instead of the Vios because the Impreza is cheaper!) and yours is Auto, both factors should improve the price for your car.  Instead of just trading in your car at Nissan when you buy a new March, try checking around your friends and colleagues if they would be interested in buying from you.  They know you so should feel comfortable that you've taken care of the car.  Many would love a Vios as a second car or first car for a newly minted driver.  Remember to factor in the Transfer Fee.  If you go this route, pm me and I'll explain all the things to keep in mind to make it a smooth simple process.<br><br>You can then go and get the full discounts / freebies from Nissan!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
