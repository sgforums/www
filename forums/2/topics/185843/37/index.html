Becos Sound proofing got two type, 1 layer   and double layer. One layer like no effect. The inner layer is a tough job , is a big project! if u did it wrongly u will get urself into trouble, if u did not clean well, the SP mat will drop off after sometime.<br><br>If anyone want to do SP just go to SILENT, they specialise in doing Sound Proofing. I got my car done up there, they give me special dealer's rate. If anyone walk in they going to charge u normal price , so just msg me if anyone interested.<br><br>Sound proof is quite personal requirement. Depend what type of noise that u want to cut down, U go to Silent they will guide u.<br><br>http://www.cardomain.com/ride/2475838  my ride! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Adding too much SP layers and HiFi system does increase the weight.<br>Can you really feel the 'lack of power' or 'lethargic' when the car is fully loaded up once in a while when the whole family is inside vs daily driving alone or with your GF/Wife?<br>In my opinion changing to heavier rim/tyre is worst, because the increased rotational mass is felt easily by the engine during acceleration phase.<br><br>Anyway....my mum's car is still not ready for collection....actually due mainly to my mum who is not in Singapore these few weeks! The SE called many times to my mum to delivery the good news....but my mum just cooly told him...sorry not now because she is travelling much this year end for overseas business!<br><br>I guess the car will have to sit in the yard under the hot sun till next year 2007...when my mum is 'more' available to go down to TC to settle the insurance and loan matters.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think everyone should not mind of adding extra weight . If adding or changing of stuff give u better ride just go ahead. If u really mind the weight can cause lack of power and high fuel comsumtion. I think u going to ask ur family and frens not take take a ride in ur car, becos each person will average will add on 55kg, if u fetch 4 person including driving is total 220kg!!! IS A LOT MORE WEIGHT! then changing to a bigger rims or SP.! ur car going to drinks man!! when u r taking ur family and frens for a ride!<br><br>If u really want to lighten the car to give u better power and fuel consumption i suggest u should take off all the seats, dashboard, side panel and spare tyres, everything only left with the driver seat.  The will really give a perfect power and low comsumption!<br><br>Most important u have to enjoy ur ride,  human's needs is always unable to fully satisfy. When u get use it, u will feel is not power enough , u want it better! Notting is perfect, lighter car give u lesser comfort,l ower price and heavier car give u better stability, comfort and higher price to pay for.  Try to balance ur needs and wants. U going to have a better day ahead.! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><a href="http://www.cardomain.com/ride/2475838.%20%20&lt;img%20src=" title="Cool"> " target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.cardomain.com/ride/2475838.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </a></div>

Sometimes, there are small scratches and dents when the service technicians are not careful.  Some owners specifically ask that the car is not washed.  Any scratches should be settled with Nissan right away.  If you drive off, then they will say it's your fault.<br><br>The other good practice for any car is to occasionally take it for a long highway drive.  Malaysia is easier but you can still loop around Singapore.  This runs the engine and burns off excess carbon deposits.  Start-stop city driving is actually quite stressful for cars.<br><br>Enjoy your March!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
