I'll do it!!<br><br>Dear NYC,<br><br>Not all of us are as well versed in everything about cars as you.. While we do respect the opinions you provide to this forum (including me! thanks manz!), some of us like to explore other products available on the market and curious to find out wat each product can value add to our beloved Marchie (Sometimes with our fingers crossed!!)... whether its' RP oilor stamford tyres or filters.... these have been organised with good intentions and no commission has been accepted. .. If not for my hubby's objection that i over tired myself. i would have gone for the stamford tyre talk too.. juz to hear what they have to say about their products!<br><br>Every talk that we organised, as you are well aware, are juz for info sharing.. any money we collect are for refreshments/food, sometimes @ the expense of the own committee members! So, no fair to accuse us of profiting from such events.... especially since we are spending our own free precious available time to organise, instead of spending it with our families..<br><br>Dear Kamen &amp; King &amp; vandgal &amp; rest of committee...<br>Thks for defending the committee on the commission thingy.. appreciate all the organisation you guys have been doing.. &amp; sorry that I can't assist this period...<br><br>Nevertheless, all parties are entitled to their own opinions on this forum. We will respect that. And we WILL defend when we encounter opinions that is reflecting untruths on our behaviour. No need to block/ moderate anything here!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all fellow Marchies,<br><br>I haven't visited this site for so long that I forgot my password.<br><br>Now that I have got it, can anyone tell me how to change my password? Thanks in advance.<br><br>I attended the Stamford talk last Sunday and must say that it was petty well organised. But I think Stamford was too ambitious and tried to introduce too many products such that it finished at past nine instead of the scheduled 6.30pm. But I felt that Stamford went to a lot of trouble for us. Their staff were still cleaning up at 9.25pm when I left. Their enthusiasm for their job and/or their company is really eye-opening. I would mention it to Mr Wee Kok Wah or Dawn if I see them<br><br>As usual the food was good, thanks to the organisers and/or Stamford.<br>Since I was talking too much I missed Faded Mango's cheesecake! I am still kicking myself after all these days. Well at least I am not suffering from withdrawal symptoms.<br><br>The talk started with the Stamford representative telling us about alloy wheels.<br>I am sure all of you know much about alloy wheels. The only thing I will add here is that alloy rims are stronger than the standard steel rims. In the case of an accident or when your car hits a bump or obstruction on the road, at speed, you will be infinitely thankful if the tyre does not burst due to a cracked rim. As you know, a cracked rim or a burst tyre at speed will cause your car to lose control, or worse, tip over. More so for the March I think, unfortunately. The advantages, a slightly faster acceleration, perhaps, are inconsequential. However, since they typically cost only a fraction (less that 1 %) of the cost of the car, they only have to save your skin (and a_s) once and they would have paid for themselves many times over. This is something like health insurance, if we have to make a claim once, it will pay for itself many times over.  Of course many of us consider the cosmetics more important and I don't disagree. Alloy rims definitely look sportier, better and cooler than steel rims. (I am not advertising for Stamford).<br><br>Next there was Broquet. For the uninformed and for those who missed the dinner last Sunday, Broquet is a metallic additive that is inserted into your fuel tank OR connected between your fuel lines OR both (for the kiasus). It is supposed to catalyse the fuel and change the molecular structure such that they carry a higher octane rating and become more easily combustible. Net result? Better combustion in the piston chambers, leading to less carbon deposits in the chambers, more energy released, better efficiency in power creation, better fuel economy, lower fuel costs, more power. As less carbon build-up is experienced over time, the engine stays more efficient over time also, and the whole process is repeated, better fuel economy, more power, better betters etc., etc., lah, lah...<br><br>The product life is for 400,000km and so the agent says you can disconnect it when you change your car. 400,000km approximates 20 driving years for us here in Singapore.<br><br>Is this true? I only know of a friend who has used it and he claims it works very well. Unfortunately I also asked a Nissan engineer and he claims it does not. So who is right? I hope many other Broquet users here give their FRANK opinion about their experiences with the product. It will benefit not only us but also the general motoring public<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi again,<br><br>Sorry for the long post but at least I hope it is more pleasant than all the previous bickering. (no offence to all, just a joke)<br>On Broquet, the agent is willing to give a 30 day money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product. Ie you will only lose about $30, being the costs of the installation if you want your money back. On top of that there is a 10% discount if you buy before July 30th (correct me if I am wrong)<br><br>The economics are simple as the agent says you will have a 10 % savings in fuel usage. If your monthly petrol bill is $300, 10% is $30 pm =$360 pa =free Broquet after 1 year.<br><br>Personally I am interested and hope that we can get a bigger discount if we go 'en-bloc'. So who's interested to go with me? Those who want to get their money back before 1 month can do so. Ie the guarantee need not be done 'en-bloc'.<br><br>There was also a HEPA standard filter selling for about $40+, customised to fit our Marchies. Since this is cheaper than that offered by Nissan (at $80+) and better, I think my conclusion is obvious.<br><br>The best reason for using or changing interior air filters is to look at the used air filters themselves.<br><br>I am sorry for this long post but I need to run many errands now. I will continue with the other products later. Perhaps those of you who were present  can also contribute, at least those who ate the cheesecake, since I had none (still grieving).<br><br>Peace man. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Toadie</div>
