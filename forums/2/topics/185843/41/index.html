            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yes....finished the sound proofing job over the long holidays.<br>Did up the entire whole car. Roof, bonnet, engine firewall, tailgate, spare tire cavity, doors, etc. The whole works! Boy was it tiring, whole body is now sore!<br><br>The sound isolation is now perfect! Quiet bliss in the car at low cruising speed.<br>However at high speed(&gt;80km/hr), the wind noise and tyre roar is getting more obstrusive.<br><br>My conclusion is that noise isolation can only be isolated partly by the soundproofing mats.<br>To have a totally 'quiet' car, the car structural design will have to strong to resist resonance in the design phase (obviously Nissan March as a budget small car, do not consider such matters while in the drawing board, unlike Lexus/BMW/Mercs)<br><br>Ok....now for the next phase.....the Performance Mod!!!<br><br></div>

So if you clock 100km per day, i.e., live in East and work in Tuas... you probably spend 8l of petrol on travelling.

That's abt 50 bucks for each full tank, or 300 for the month.<br><br>I've been using Esso Syn 5000. Have not really experimented with other types. Esso+ Citibank also give me greater discounts. There's enough oomph in 5000, so I don't intend to incur higher costs of going 8000.<br><br>Hope the above helps.<br><br>I'm currently experimenting with pumping 20l per time. Some senior members cite the lower weight as contributing to leaner fc. Have not compiled sufficient data to make useful comparison yet.<br><br></div>

You'll get used to it.  Many Nissan cars have the tin-can sound.  Even the Cefiro.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
