The March already comes with very interesting colors that are not available on other cars.  I remember they even brought in a chocolate color previously.<br><br>Autobahn has some very interesting cars.  It's a good business model too since the cars are still owned by their owners, who leave it at Autobahn hoping to sell it.  So there is no inventory cost for the dealership.  I asked a salesman there once what car he drives, and he gave me a funny look.  "I don't own a car but I can drive any of these cars anytime I want..."

Is it a knock sound when over humps? If so should be normal due to the suspension springs touching the bump stopper when the springs compress upwards. This will happen when u have two adults behind.  Also, one good way to let the guys at TC know the noise is to test the car with them and inform them when the sound appears so they can know whether it is abnormal anot...

My Nissan saleslady told me that all the speakers are factory fitted and in fact are the same speakers (which means the Cefiro and March have the same speakers) - don't know how true.  TC only fit the Headunit.  You can still try to get them replaced by TC under warranty, but I would remove your heavy techno CDs in case they say you play your music too loud.<br><br>Warranty matters can be claimed at anytime.

I brought my Vios to get kitted up with full leather at Tomo - cost me $1200 (all seats plus seatback and door panels). There are others but I'm not familiar with them.<br><br>Just give them a call to get quotation.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

They are hoping the problem goes away with time or you get used to it and won't bring it up.  Or it gets worse and you feel paiseh to bring it up later.  Just make an appointment with them specifying that it's the audio problem so that they book their audio supplier guy.  They might tell you it's normal wear and tear, but you'll have to stand firm that speakers busting up before 6000km is NOT normal.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
