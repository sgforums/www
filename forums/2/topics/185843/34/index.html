I've done my paint sealant at Tough Seal 2 years back, look for Patrick or surf their website http://www.toughseal.com.sg. I would say it protects your paint work from bird pooh, berry saps etc. I am not sure if they still provide the $10 car wash with vacuum and re-application of the sealant each time you go back, so check with them.<br><br>And yes the March is a joy to drive and with my fuel consumption hitting the average of 13+km/l, no complaints at all.</div>

They still continue to rotate my "upgraded" tyres every servicing, change the spark plugs I gave them, etc. Guess simple "changes" (I don't even wanna call them mods) should be ok but if you touch the engine put in a supercharger/turbocharger, NOS whatever, then its a different story. Anyway once you do all that, do you still want them to service for you? I still continue to service with them and one time they did not do the engine consult thingy, they even come to my house to do it for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> But you probably know of some workshop which specialises in Nissan cars (Autosaver etc) and the pple here should be able to help you out with one or two recommendations.

Mine was installed under the front passenger seat, using velcro instead of being bolted to the body.  I thought about it and maybe this is better since holes in the body could lead to water seepage and rust.  But it's not so stable and may be damaged from the car bumping around.  It's very dusty down there so high chance of damaging the changer and scratching the CDs.  The boot is so small that if the changer is bolted there, the space will be reduced quite a bit.
