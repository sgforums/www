            <div class='col-md body'>Err.. Actually, its not juz as simple as driving without a licence. The driver will definitely be barred from taking driving test fro a period of time. When U drive without licence, U r also driving without valid insurance coverage. Another charge. If involve in accident, most probably will be a jail term. Then there's the issue of the car. If the real owner of the car acknowledged that he/she knowingly lent the car to the driver, the car can be impounded. However, if the driver denied lending the car, the unlicenced driver will face another charge for thief. Confirm fine and Jail term. So not worth it lah..</div>
