Mr Widjaja will be cremated today, also at Mandai.<br><br>Mr Widjaja, an Indonesian, moved on to study economics at the London School of Economics.<br><br>He was set to begin his second year of undergraduate studies in October after his trip to Singapore, where he had arrived just a few days before the accident. Mr Davies, a Briton, was to have flown off on Sunday to study at a university in Canada.<br><br>The two friends were on their way to the McDonald's outlet in King Albert Park to meet ex-UWC schoolmates for an early breakfast when the accicdent happened at about 4am.<br><br>It is believed that Mr Widjaja was driving the convertible, which belonged to Mr Davies' father.<br><br>That the wakes were side by side was a coincidence and not by design, said Mr Widjaja's uncle, Mr Artin Widjaja.<br><br>But it certainly helped the mourners, most of whom knew both men.<br><br><span class="small">Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings.
