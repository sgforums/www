Take a good look around you, do you notice that foreigners make up quite a relatively small majority of the people around you? Is it alright for Singaporeans to make mistakes on the road and put the lives of other innocent Singaporeans in danger? Where do you want to put your fellow Singaporeans who may also be causing the same problem with speeding?<br><br>The fact that you seem unable to look past the fact that the driver and passengers were expatriates show that your stupidity and ignorance make whatever opinions you have expressed worthless.  It's alot easier to post insensitive comments anonymously online when you don't know any of the victims isnt it? Well lets see what you have to say if any of your friends are ever in a situation like this. Oh no wait, you wouldn't care because its only foreigners who should be condemned for incident's such as these right??<br><br>Foreign Trash? Let's not delve into this racist territory which is best left alone for people with a similar IQ and primitive mentality as yourself, but aren't foreigners actually welcomed into Singapore with open arms? But lets not go there, I am a foreigner myself, and a debate on this issue isn't appropriate here, although I must say I haven't encountered any form of blind racism like this here in the past. Anyway if you choose not to welcome foreigners, then don't. I havent had any bad encounters with Singaporeans in the past, and if that's because people like you choose to stay out our way, then it's fine by me. Stay home then, try and pretend that globalisation isnt taking place all around you.<br><br>Taxpayer's money? I'm genuinely sorry that some of the burden of this will fall on innocent people who have had nothing to do with the incident.

            <div class='col-md body'>The evidence is so clear. Doesn't matter if there was/wasn't a stationary taxi on  one of the lanes, if the driver was not speeding, he would have braked in time.<br><br>The fact that the driver did not stepped on the brakes means:<br><br>1) He was way above the speed limit, to brake now would means hitting the bum of the "taxi".<br><br>2) He took the chance to switch lanes to avoid the "taxi". Alas, his experience (the lack-of) with his driving and the FR MX5, plus the speed that he was travelling means the MX5 started swerving.<br><br>3) The rest is history.<br><br></div>
