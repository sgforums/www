Then only call the fire/police dept.<br><br>In this case, the alarm was raised immediately, which was a correct action by one of the young resident nearest the burning car. The other residents came out with their own fire extinguishers, but the flame was too intense for them to get near to effectively fight the fire. Furthermore there is the danger of a fireball explosion.<br>Vehicular fires must be put down while it is just starting and smoking, with Class B extinguishers for flamable liquids/grease. For a conflagration, it best left to the experts, like our Civil Defence fire fighters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>drink driving or not i guess no one can confirm tat. but judging from the the impact, i believe the vehicle had travelled above the legal limits.<br><br>i agreed tat stomp shouldn't haf post some pics. posting the after effect is probably ok but i felt tat it is morally wrong to post pictures where 2 humans are being consumed by flame alive. but anyway, since when do they filter their posting choice? they only concern about the number of hits on their webby.<br><br>sad to see pple killed in such accidents but fortunae thing is tat no other road users had been drag into this incident.<br><br>RIP. life goes on.</div>
