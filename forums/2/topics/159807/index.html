            <div class='col-md body'>City seems to be a better choice.. But alot of people don' like City because honestly, while it has great boot space and nice interior, the price is markedly more ex than vios.. Vios has good FC, good proven track record.

            <div class='col-md body'>city or vios. either one.<br>i see FC as an impt factor as it is the long run expenses. thus a car with really gd FC is very attractive.<br><br>but however its ur perspective on cars, if u nid it only for travelling as a kind of transport then maybe go for the vios. i tot the new facelift was no much different compare to the present one.<br><br>honda cars are gd. if nt y so many driving center uses them?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>city is very competitive to vios. both are gd. and nice.<br><br>sunny.... er..... no comments on sunny. dun really like the ride.<br>but it has a rather high FC. some said tats its has a gd handling. nt sure thou nv tried b4.<br><br>but i guess city or vios r a gd choice for singaporeans budget.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>gd luck on ur car hunting!</div>

And I've always said, that there are many other things which will burn your bank account faster than FC ratings.  If you don't travel very much, its really not practical scrutinising FC ratings.<br><br>Heavier doesn't necessarily mean safer.  It depends on where the weight is - most of the time, its in the engine or gear.....or due to difference in body size.  These do not necessarily have any influence on occupant safety.<br><br>In my previous job, I used to work for a company producing victim extration systems in case of car accidents.  In my training, I've cut up cars before at the scrap yard.  Even the supposedly heavy US-made cars were just a thin sheet of metal wrapped around a metal frame.<br><br>Occupant safety nowadays almost always means airbags (passive safety) - front, side, rear, etc.  And airbags do not contribute much to the weight of the car.  ie. weight is no indication of safety.<br><br>For each car, there are crash tests.  Different countries have different standards for these tests (frontal impact, side impact, etc).  And most modern vehicles sold in Singapore have passed these tests.<br><br>Here is a pdf document from the internet showing some crash test observations.  You will notice that based on REAL-LIFE ACCIDENTS, the heavier, more expensive, more famous European cars are sometimes less safe than the so-called light Japanese "tin-can" cars.<br><br><a href="http://www.folksam.se/engelsk/trafik_eng/sakrabilar2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.folksam.se/engelsk/trafik_eng/sakrabilar2005.pdf</a> (See page 4).<br><br>This reminds me of a rich friend who always went for European cars, saying that its because they're safer for his family. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

If you don't travel very much, its really not practical scrutinising FC ratings.<br><br>Heavier doesn't necessarily mean safer.  It depends on where the weight is - most of the time, its in the engine or gear.....or due to difference in body size.  These do not necessarily have any influence on occupant safety.<br><br>...<br></div></blockquote>Can anyone list out FC for Nissan 1.6 auto vs Vios 1.6?/1.5? auto?<br><br>are they different by 1/2km per litre?<br><br>i do travel a lot, probably one working day will hit 60km.</div>

My daughter owns a vios auto for 1 yr.now ..so far so gd.<br><br>sunny more stable but very reliable. I owned sunny ss mt for 4 yrs. I had zero breakdown and no problems at all. Spent $0 other than the normal svcing. still using original battery when i traded in last mth for a Nissan latio. I have 100% trust on a nissan<br><br>altho sunny fc not so good....but makes littel diff to yr pocket unless u use it like taxi.<br><br>i never got to buy a honda cos its price is always much higher compare apple to apple.<br><br>i never go for looks in a car as No. 1 .......reliability and other practical factors mor impt.</div>
