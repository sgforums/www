I'm driving a '96 toyota corona and just sprayed it around this April. The car was actually badly scratched and slightly crashed at the backlights before, together with stubborn stains, so decided to respray the whole car, both exterior and interior. Total cost is about 1800+ altogether if i remember correctly, which includes interior cleaning as well. The effect was great, everyone thought that i changed to the '00 model.<br><br>I personally think it is not neccessary to respray the whole car for you now, yeh, because its still new. I suggest just spraying the spoiler will do.. or just bear with it. Later respray already, kana again, sad and waste money just for a spot. Like mine, respray already, less than a week, kana a long scratch, so sayang and angry. Feel like wacking that evil assh*le..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wei, suggest u hold off re-spraying ur spoiler unless u got the extra cash to splash since u juz lost ur job. i personally have a small scratch on my rear bumper caused by some prick who bribed his way to pass his parallel parking but i "loon" with it cause got no money....... road tax coming and i panick liao.<br><br>there's a cheaper method to ur problem- get the paint shop to patch the spot where its damaged. downside is, if the shop doesn't do a good job, the patching would look a different color from the rest of ur spoiler. think it costs less then 50 bucks for a small area.</div>
