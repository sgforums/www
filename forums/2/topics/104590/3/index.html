But the best solution is yet to be invented; a sensor installed in all vehicles that can detect traces of alcohol vapor emitted from a driver or any occupants in a car, and disables the engine. It exists, but still on the drawing board.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am sorry to say this but I am not against any type of drivers personally cos I feel whatever car you buy, you can be responsible. If you are reckless, a Perodua can kill you also, dun nid WRX...<br><br>BUT personally I dun noe isit a guy thing or ego thing, but when I use to drive a KIA, I did not drive fast, I drive normal... but when I now change to a VTEC CITY, which is not super power but definitely more power than KIA, I notice myself revving more and driving faster.... I guess if I am driving a Rex now...i would be worse... thus I guess its not the fault of the car but sometimes we drivers esp guy drivers need to curb that need for speed and power.... dun just becos see fast car means must drive fast and reckless...<br><br>Of cos some people ask me, dun drive fast you buy fast car for what  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I dun noe what to say also hahaha</div>

I can only say there muz be a reason why the insurance is higher for young drivers and those wif less experience. </div></blockquote>The answer is in your statement. Ironic isn't it ??!!!<br>Young drivers have less experience, therefore they may not be able to pre-empt or forsee an oncoming accident which an experienced driver with his years of experience , would have done. This is why they pay higher insurance.<br><br>NOT because they have a tendancy to speed and get into accidents as a result.<br><br>Eg. There are a number of bastard taxi-drivers who speed up and close-in on the gap when you signal your intention to filter into his lane.<br><br>Now, obviously these bastards do wan others to do the same to them. Therefore they abdopt an aggressive stance, signalling at the last moment and cutting into your lane unexpectedly.<br><br>An experienced driver will be able to spot these bastards easily. One can tell by the driver constantly lookin into the mirror, car leaning close to the lane markings, non-constant speed of the vehicle ......<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by huoye:</div><div class="quote_body">and i believe u read wad statement i said most if not all grow out of this phase.<br></div></blockquote>Let me repeat again<br>This "phase" affects only a portion of the population. The numbers are not many as the forumers here suggests. But yes, I agree that they must be kept in check by the authorities.<br>A few rotten apples do not spoil the whole basket. There are also many responsible and safe young drivers around. They should NOT be discriminated or penalized just becos of a few black sheep.</div>
