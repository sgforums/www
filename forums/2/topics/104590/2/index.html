            <div class='col-md body'>well seems like not only pple who drive are highly prone to accidents.<br>Its becoming more of innocent pple who least expect an accident to occur esp abt losing their own lives within spilt seconds. getting too dangerous to travel around...think government should sanction bullet proof vest kindof clothings for everyone. like that bus bang also no injury. Even if the driver of the subaru wasnt at fault for the accident, he will still be law breaker for exceeding the alcohol limit and driving. And he's only 20.. too young to get into this kind of mess....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I go for defensive driving course every year. And to be frank, besides the fun, what they are teaching are actually everything we all always knew and that is do not speed.<br><br>They did an example with us that just travelling at 60Km/H and drive towards an instructor, just about 50 m about from him, he will raise a hand, if he raise right, we go left, if he raise left we go right and we have to avoid the cone on each side. Guess what, out of 3 times, most of us reacted wrongly or recklessly.<br><br>I guess the moral is that dun speed. Slow down at bends. Some people think cornering drive damn fast damn stylo, let me tell you I once did that and I kena oil patch and thats why I skidded and spin.  Tell me, how to see oil patch when you travelling at like 100km/h and when you skid at that speed, you think you can help urself?<br><br>The instructors always tell me, the principle in defensive driving is to expect people to make mistakes, no point learning how to control your vehicle when you skid, no point learning how to do hard braking, no point learning how to do this and that when you are driving at 100+ km/h, because when accidents happen at that speed, whether your fault or not, no amount of defensive driving gonna help you.</div>

Most have families to think about wont be that stupid to be racing and drinking at the same time.. while the fact that mid-range powerful cars can be afforded by younger people in their 20s. Who thinks they are the king of the world.. can drink and drive or speed. or worse drink, drive and speed. If they are dead, no one will pity them. Insurance cant be claimed. But the worse thing is they bring their friends or other people with them. If they survive which somehow, drivers will. maybe is the air bag on the driver side. They just have to live thru the rest of their lives knowing they took the lifes of innocent people.</div>

How many times do you see people actually giving way in a merging lane ( 2 to 1 ) - usually the one behind will try to squeeze pass you dangerously close??<br><br>Such is the attitudes of motorists on our roads. The flashier the car is, the more uncouth the driver is. So, I strongly recommend the use of regulatory terms to curb ownership of "fast cars".<br><br>Does not the Tekwando instructor before commencing teaching the art of defense and breaking your opponent's bones, tells his student that he/she should ONLY use the art as self-defense and not for offense? It is likewise with a muscle car; too much power, and one is likely to forget him/herself. Only to end up saying sorry in court, or, in heaven or hell.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i haf seen a lambo speeding on the road towards boat quay. So is it cuz the driver haf experience so he is able to speed or wad?? i dun think the cars make a difference. If majority of the cars r ferraris , lambos, mesarati, and not the exotic cars r some jap cars i think u will still see an equally or higher amt. of accidents on the road.<br>But wad its true is dat youngsters tend to drive more recklessly but den again how do u know those middle-aged pple r not racers or reckless drivers when they r young. IMO its juz cuz after driving for so many years they r juz bored of speeding and filtering in and out.<br>I believe most young drivers will go thru this phase of life. If for eg. the age limit for hafing a licence is raised to 30 or above i guess it still be the same. Those pple that cuz accidents will be those in their 30s.<br>For me personally, i would want to drive a performance car now, followed by MPV when i haf kids and when my kids grow up i will go back to a family car like the camry. So i guess most if not all pple go grow this phase in life.<br><br>.........my 2cents worth....wahhhhhh long time no write compo liao..</div>
