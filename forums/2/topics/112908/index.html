And btw u does not need to pay in 7 day, Just tell them u didnt recieve /saw any summon in the first place. But u must pay the fine in 7 day once they send u the warning letter.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I was there once with houye and we saw the uncles booking other cars when we entered the carpark ... so we came up with a plan ... and the plan is that houye will approach those uncles and ask them how to tear a coupon as the time was 1am ... it would be a waste if we were to tear a $2 coupon ... but guess what ??? The 2 uncles actually told us not to tear and they will not give us any GIFTs ... hahaha so lucky ...<br><br>As for your appeal, 1st time appeal is equal to 99% success but please give a more reasonable reason ... Ignorance can't be a reason ...<br><br>For a faster processing time, appeal at AMK HDB Branch ... if not you can appeal at any HDB branches or at TPY HDB main office. All you need is just to fill in a form with your statement.<br><br>Good luck</div>
