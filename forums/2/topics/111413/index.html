Its easy to understand the need for OPC but which in your case it does not seems to apply... You are giving me the impression that you need one for wayang; merely wayang... And you are choosing 2 car models that seriously speaking; won't turn heads... So u sure u doing this? And what's there to wayang on weekday nights or weekends when there isn't so much traffic on the road???? Unless you intend to make circles from Borders to City Hall and back then perhaps you do have a ground to justify. But even then, it's a poor justification doing that...<br><br>U sure your ego is worth spending that kind of $????</div>

The simple fact remains that everything that got to do with the car the government will definitely "earn one hand" inside it... From petrol to road tax to insurance to season parking to veh inspection to buying the car itself; GST, ARF, RF, servicing costs etc etc etc the government have a share in it. Tobacco and Vehicle are 2 main income source for the government coffers. They can't encourage you to smoke more to beef up their treasury but they certainly can make cars more affordable by lowering ARF and increasing COE quota. So in a way, pple like you who a bit 'anti-government' will think that you actually get away with a bargain getting an OPC. But the fact remains after you get that OPC car, you are still trapped inside this rat race... Try to suppress those hallucinations of yours thinking you found a way out beating the system. As long as you dun like the system at all, you will always find fault with it. And you will never be satisfied. So what's the point of getting a car at all then?<br><br>Its been 2 days since u posted the thread. I seriously cannot offer you any good advise based on your situations and conditions. And from the cold response to this thread so far, I guess I can only wished you all the best in getting the answer you want... You got to convince the rest why your thread should draw more aggressive debates than the sarcastic and unconstructive remarks that you had received so far...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by benhur80:<br>OPC has no road tax or a minimal of 50bucks.<br><br>I truly agree with you that Singaporeans are opportunists who will not hesitate to beat the system... My point is when it comes to buying a car, there is almost no known method of beating the system. I fully concur that there are a lot of jokers out there risking themselves modifying capacitance switches to their fuel gauges in order to go JB pump petrol. But that is trying to beat the system only after you bought the car...In which the penalties of doing so is often harsh and merciless I should say... it all boils down to your very own mentality that you had already beaten the system while doing so and deriving pleasure while doing it... I must say that's very subjective and differ from person to person....<br><br>Anyway I am still very concern abt your knowledge in the OPC scheme... Please do more readup regarding this clause... LTA says: "Discount of $800 per year from normal car road tax, subject to a minimum of $50 per year" That means to say OPC cars enjoy $800 off prevailing tax rate. If your payable road tax is &lt;$50 then you pay $50. Which smart alec told you its $50 or no need to pay? $500 + 0.75 x (EC Â– 1,000); that's the formulae from LTA. A vios is rated at 1497cc. The road tax payable is $873. Minus $800 u still have to pay $73 per year. For a kia 1.8 your road tax would be: 1600 cc &lt; EC &lt;= 3000 cc S$950 + 1.5 x (EC - 1600)  which is = $1240-800 = $440! Yes this figures are not a lot but please be careful and prudent in your research! It really goes to show who's the ignorant one... Fancy thinking that you actually have all the sums work out I think u better re-evaluate your position again...  Very worrying that your ego is blinding you on your decision. Anyway its your $ to lose not mine so its all in your liberty to do what you wan with it...<br><br>Having said all these I enjoy sparing with you on this issue...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Maybe a bit harsh but I hoped so far my comments are of no offence to you. My sincere apologies if you need one... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello see tees,<br><br>i know how the opc scheme and i am only stating out an example of minimum 50bucks for roadtax.(i did not mentioned which car i intend to get as i seek from you guys opinion...yes,1.5L roadtax is 73,which is ard the region of 50bucks and i juz state it conveniently without working out the sums)no details calculation from me.if u said roadtax is a major prob, then what about COE price?<br><br>from your first comments, you did not give a solid answer to my question regarding which car to choose,neither did the rest.<br><br>now,you gave a proper situation as to suggest to me to save more money on road tax btw 1.5 and 1.8L which at least enlighten me with a point on which to choose. this is the sort of point i am seeking. if u say to save money on roadtax,that is a point. others may say it is more spacious and maybe the engine is good,and these are the point i am seeking to gather. the PROS and the CONS....then,from there i can weigh it out. Of coz,money factors weigh the most!!!<br><br>if only so u mentioned this earlier advising me to save money on roadtax and forgo the ego thing......and not conveniently go straight to the ego and government thing, we wouldnt have come to this issue at all.<br><br>as for the ciggarrettes and pumping of oil, unless u r a member of PAP, i think most will go with this system.</div>

No finger pointing but in the beginning you do give us the impression that the real issue behind getting a car for yourself is more of an ego thing than practicality... Thats y the other 2 guys also did not commit to a definitive answer... Haha.. anyway glad we sort everything out... As for the solid answer u r looking for I'm afraid I can't give cos' from my point of view both cars have not much of a resale value to talk abt... One is a reliable brand but with too much of them on the road running (thus selling it would not fetch a good price) and the other one is not even anywhere better than the worst Japanese make... Perhaps u can try considering other makes? More popular ones... These are the ones that will have resale values. Makes like the popular 4 (Nissan, Toyota, Honda n Mit.) But with regards to "crashing" cars driven by ladies in terms of size I really cannot offer any good answer. There is a tradeoff between size and how much u r willing to pay for the road tax so no definite answer to that...<br><br>As for the cigarettes and the petrol pumping in JB? Well, we leave that to each individual owners to decide if it's worth the risk and trouble shall we? Else we will venture to nowhere again...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, initially,i do make it sound as if it is the ego thing i am going,but as i term what are my 'needs' for getting a car, would like you fellas brothers opinion whether it is worth it.<br><br>as for toyota vios, u said it has no resale value becoz it is too common.However,u ask me to consider the top 4 brand(honda,toyota blah blah...)so,what advise u can give me that satisfy an average car size, good resale value, money worth the driving(preferably engine not sluggish).Do you suggest mazda2?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo,<br><br>M2? I wouldnt recommend. In fact for your case I would not recommend any Mazdas at all. Nothing personal though. Just hated the idea that the agent is sucking too much profits out of buyers for their cars just becos their cars looks and feels good. For pple like u and me who is more concern on budget, M Cars are out. Their depreciation is way too 'abnormally' steep...<br><br>Seriously speaking OPCs have a big problem with resale value less classic and vintage OPCs. I suggested the 4 popular makes is to savage what we can at the end of the day; not becos' they really have better resale values. Well yes they have better (i mean slightly higher) resale value ONLY if you compare them to other makes for the OPC. Yes, the News reported a sruge in OPC ownership in 2004. BUT! But! most of those are Picantos, Getz and Wiras if you noticed on the roads. Some are Citys and Vios. Common traits? Well, they are all budget cars. Not really good looking.. Just functional thats all. These owners are the true hardcore type that insisted nothing less for a car that simply do the pt A to pt B chore but nothing was emphasized on the looks and to a certain extent for picantos and getz; Resale values...<br><br>The one daunting requirement in your query is this resale value thing. If you can forego the looks and perhaps settle for something less seriously the picanto and getz is really a very good buy. Now, for these 2, their road tax really only $50. No horse run abt it. Insurance? Will be cheaper since their Market values are lower and their CC are smaller. This helps to cut down even more on your mthly expenditure. Only thing is can you live with such small cars? And how soon do you intend to sell/upgrade the OPC?<br><br>Let me go think and read again what r your best options. First time suggesting makes for OPC. A slightly demanding and perculiar case here. Will get back to you asap on my ideas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess we really need to know which car captures your eyes most on the road? Quite hard to suggest cars out of the blue. For good resale value, I think most Japanese car can promise you that. But now with the gov's rumor of reducing PARF and such, resale car prices are going to be so low that it is going to be a big loss to sell off you car rather than driving it for 10 years.<br><br>Personally I would suggest Lancer/Colt or City/Jazz. These cars are less popular than Vios, so you wouldn't be just "another Vios". All are relatively nice car with a decent size. Vios, I guess it is too small for you ego!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, lancer engine is sluggish and too beng-lookalike?correct me if i am wrong<br><br>honda comes up top with slightly higher by few Ks compared to others small cars(eg.vios,etc) which their price can actually matches those bigger car,but of course,korean make,if u get what i mean.<br><br>OPC car can later registered as a normal car with of course,paying back the price of the COE minus the year that i have used(got formula,but never work it out). My intention is to enjoy the 17K off the market price for about 3-5yrs,before i make up my decision to upgrade to a normal car(if my job by then,requires me to),or to sell it off and get a better,luxury car if my career permits. because by the year 5yrs,i would have fully paid(5yrs loan,intending to get), or partially paid(7years,at most), i would have breakeven etc.....<br><br>you guys get what i mean?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OPC for picanto and getz is defintely out for u if ur ego is bruised by the sight of woman driving in flashy car.<br><br>Imagine stopping at a traffic light and beside ur car is a woman driver in a Mazda 6 while u are in a small picanto OPC.. based on what u said in ur first post, I dont think u can stomach tt.<br><br>What I recommend is go with ur heart...From the way I look at it.

For those private ones, they don't take this NS thing into consideration. My first job (engineer), I was paid the same as the ladies, and those guys who didn't even earn a honours. Sad to say, though it is true, most teacher do really have real working experences. Most re-entered into the school straight from Uni. Lastly, don't show this to your teacher, definitely kanna fail by your teacher for poor usage of English.<br><br>Back to the topic, Benhur80, can you roughly set your budget? Your first post suggest you can afford a 67k car. That is why I suggest Honda. Do remember that there is a reason why it is so expensive. It is quality! If it is within my budget I would rather get it. Big and cheap usually spells trouble. For example, you know how many people curse and swear after they bought Matrix? Ya, its sale is quite good the moment it came to Singapore, spacious MVP and so cheap. After that, everyone started to complain about it. Worse case is news spread so fast than even if you want to get ride of the car, you can't. Because it has no resale value.<br><br>Now, from your post, you talk about up-grading. If so, please don't go for non-japanese cars. Japanese cars have build a very good reputation for its reliability. So for resale value, you still have to look at the brand. Alright, if Hondas are a bit out of your budget, and you think lancer is beng (actually I don't, but who cares), how about Suzuki Liana 1.6? Also a nice, reliable car with a decent resale value. Bigger than Vios. Actually City is now ranging from 57.5k (idsi manual) to 63.5k (vtec auto). No really that expensive now, compared to Vios's price 1-2 months ago.<br><br>Actually I think subaru more Beng. Then again, who cares?</div>
