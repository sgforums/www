Only about 10% of this carpark is occupied.<br><br>Sometimes, I'd find this strange fellow's car parked way up on a deserted floor with no other cars in sight.<br><br>If he's parking for security reasons, I don't know what kind of security sense he has, parking in a floor with not a soul in sight.<br><br>My neighbors, friends, and peoples in general, will park so that they can see their cars. Therefore, people stick to particular lots.<br><br>I am fully aware that NO ONE, have ANY rights to any one particular lot. But nonetheless, taking people's regular space is somewhat disruptive and rude. Although it is not a crime.<br><br>Car scratching at the multi-storey carpark at my estate is difficult to do without being noted or spotted. Because the carpark floors are only about 30 meters away from surrounding blocks. Even if one resorts to crwaling on his belly to reach a car and scratch it, you'd still be seen.<br><br>So people generally park near windows of surrounding blocks, and residents will have particular lots they will stick to.

Therefore, people stick to particular lots.<br><br>I am fully aware that NO ONE, have ANY rights to any one particular lot. But nonetheless, taking people's regular space is somewhat disruptive and rude. Although it is not a crime.<br><br>Car scratching at the multi-storey carpark at my estate is difficult to do without being noted or spotted. Because the carpark floors are only about 30 meters away from surrounding blocks. Even if one resorts to crwaling on his belly to reach a car and scratch it, you'd still be seen.<br><br>So people generally park near windows of surrounding blocks, and residents will have particular lots they will stick to. This guy is like going around making people's day by taking up their usual choice of lots.<br><br></div></blockquote>I dun think anything wrong wif that...maybe he parked at ur lot n u r not happy...maybe next time u can use a rubbish bin to put at ur lot...he might not notice that this particular car always parked at the lot since u say ur carpark is very empty,so its even harder to differentiate unless u look at the lot num....if u want,den next time juz tell him loh..he park way up maybe his doing some hanky panky biz...ha ha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
