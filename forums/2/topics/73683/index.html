            <div class='col-md body'>Any damage and repair done on automobile is forever a repaired unit. Im not sure if you are doing your friend a favor by getting the car, mind you a 1 year old with replaced engine,  the body work must have gone extensive repair and replacement. You probably will not get any problems in 9 mths - 1yr time, afterwhich the uncertainty level is high.<br><br>Personally, if you want to invest, "BTW owning a car is a losing investment, finacially", I believe you want sometime that has a resonable amount of reliability, that vechicle must be your tool not the other way. In the long run if the repair costs is going to shoot up, it will hurt the pocket a lot more. Having say all this if you have the money, nobody can stop you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agree with copperhead<br><br>my guess is that it can't be a car so rare that u are actaully considering it, especialy with the engine replaced. Can't think of any reason why anyone wld...<br><br>think there are just too much risk and uncertainty involved with that car. i wld not, knowing that the engine has been changed. Changing the engine is a big job, many things can go wrong<br><br>if it shd give you problem latter, you may end up spending lots of time and $ on it, not to mention the frustration.<br><br>if you are considering a one-year old car, assuming $ is not a big issue. Suggest u go for a new ride.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="small"><span style="color: brown;">Okie, thanks a lot for the advice.<br><br>Actually my family are intending to juz get a used car for family use, you know, old parents and young kids. Our intention was to change to a new car after 2 to 3 yrs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  The reason y I dun mind getting my fren's car is I have ride it a lot of times before, so I know generally it doesn't have a problem. Juz felt that it will be better knowing the "history" of the car than to juz buy a second hand off from a dealer who also not sure if honest or not. <span style="font-style: italic;">*Dunno if I make sense or not.Haha*</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Juz one more question, if say. the car owner got the car at a price of, say 59k, wat will probably be a good price to get from him? 40k izzit too low or too much?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Will consider more carefully before getting. Thanks again pals.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With 40K you can put in a good downpayment for a good and new family car, which safety and value would not be compromised, and with today's 3 yr warranty etc, it make more sense and good for your pocket than to get a 2nd hand vehicle. Think of your family safety especilly with small kids in the car... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The value of the second cars depends on many factors, one is the depreciation value of the vehicle, depending on the make and condition etc... COE.. OMV.... you can check the OMV using the LTA website by entering the licence plate number. Typical on paper depreciation for a Jap car can range from 6.5k to 10k per year. As i mention it can vary alot.</div>
