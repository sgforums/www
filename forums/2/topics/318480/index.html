              <p>I have compiled a list of rare car pics specially for the first page of this thread.</p>
              <p>There would be some cars that you guys will not even believe that it does exist in singapore. So let's start with the pictures. Pics without my watermark are not taken by me, i probably saved it from some forums some time back, so do let me know if the pic is yours and will take it down if you ask me to.</p>
              <p>1. Ferrari Enzo<br>2-3 in SG. This one posted here belongs to Hong Seh Motors.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/enzof50convoy.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336"></p>
              <p>2. Ferrari F50<br>TG has one. This one posted here i believe is imported from Japan for the Ferrari event. And yes, this is louder than Enzo.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/enzof50f430-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="327"></p>
              <p>3. Ferrari F40<br>This F40 belongs to Hong Seh Motors as well.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/f40.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336"> </p>
              <p>4. Pagani Zonda</p>
              <p>From what i know, there are only 4. 3 S 1F. No pics of F, but i believe some of you guys do have it and have posted before.<br>Yellow pagani zonda. the only road legal zonda s in town.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/yellowzonda.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336"></p>
              <p>next would be the silver zonda that was still lingering in TG's garage few years back. was sitting in AM ever since TG got his new toy. as to whr it is now, i have no idea, probably exported.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/silverzonda.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336"></p>
              <p>and the last zonda would be the red zonda S. i think it belongs to the sultan of brunei, correct me if i am wrong, memory is failing me.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/redzonda.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336"></p>
              <p>5. Lotus 340R</p>
              <p>The 340R is a special edition of the Lotus Elise. Just 340 models were built, and all were sold before they were manufactured. It uses a custom built bodyshell with no roof and no doors. All 340 cars came with a silver and black colour scheme. Special A038R tyres were developed for the 340R in collaboration with Yokohama. (from wiki) Last saw it in the Lotus showroom garage. cant find my pic, so got it from else whr way back then.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/340r.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
              <p>6. Fab Design AM1000<br>V12 engine taken out from SL600, and modified to pump out 745bhp and 1000 Nm of torque (hence it's name AM1000). Added Gull Wing doors with hydraulic pumps and 20inch Fab Design wheels. 60 were manufactured. 0-60mp/h: 3.8secs.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/am1000.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="274"></p>
              <p>The AM800 Yellow colour E-class mercedes owned by the yellow zonda owner is known to have 630 BHP. An E55 AMG engine with 476 BHP modified to pump out that about of power...</p>
              <p>7. Mercedes Benz CLK GTR Roadster</p>
              <p>A total of five CLK GTR Roadsters were built by the company. And this one i have here is one of the 5 built, and it's the only RHD available in the world (it's in SG). yes i admit, the interior is ugly.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/clkgtrroadster.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336"></p>
              <p>8. Mercedes Benz 300SL</p>
              <p>Yes, this is the very famous classic model by Mercedes with the Wing doors. And no, the heart of this car isn't wat it was used to be. Sry but i totally forgot wat they do to this car, i will just state down wat i can recall. The swap the engine for an AMG engine, not sure particularly which one. AMG rims added. Tuned to performed like any other supercars out there, and it has CD player installed if i rmb correctly, it's selling for SGD 3m.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/300slgullwing.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336"></p>
              <p>9. Pontiac GTO</p>
              <p>Nothing much, all can be found on the net, but a Pontiac is SG? That's rare. It's the 06 Model, whether AM has done any tuning to it,  wasn't sure. But it exists in sg, that's for sure.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/pontiacgto.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336"></p>
              <p>10. 40th Anniversary Lamborghini Murcielago</p>
              <p>In late 2003, Lamborghini announced a special 40th Anniversary Edition of the Murciélago, following in the footsteps of their Countach and Diablo Anniversary Editions. The limited production run of 50 vehicles featured enhancements including a limited-edition body color, carbon-fiber exterior detailing, upgraded wheels , a new revamped exhaust system, and a 40th Anniversary numbered plaque displayed along the side. The interior featured a new leather trim and additional electronic features. (from wiki) It's situated in Lamborghini Singapore Showroom, wrapped up in plastic, only displayed every now and then.<br>Pics credit to DcR</p>

              <p>11. Gemballa GTR 650 Avalanche Evo Orange<br>This car isn't a SG registered car, but it comes to sg often. I had the chance to do a photoshoot for it while the owner brought it here. more pics of this car, can be found at my web <a href="http://www.vanq.net">http://www.vanq.net</a>. Will cost ard 1m to bring into sg.</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l241/vanq_3/gemballa650.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="500"></p>
              <p>12. Koenig F48</p>
              <p>You must be thinking... A Koenig? Yes it exists in sg. Not very well known, but it is situated in some owner's garage. I was passing by a house one day, when i saw this mysterious car that shapes like a F40 and covered up with a cloth. Curious, i asked owner who is doing gardening to open the cover. He was friendly enough to entertain me. And there it is, a yellow Koenig F48. Rare shit... No pics, sry... Camera phone wasn't a common gadget during that time.</p>
              <p>13. Jaguar XJ200</p>
              <p>There are two. One in AM, one in jaguar showroom. Banned form roads in late 90s i think, correct me if i m wrong. Pic Credit to GTI WR6</p>

              <p>Nice pics Vanquish, just a few things to add =</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- The red Zonda now belongs to the Crown Prince of Johor, aka "TMJ"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Their royal family bought two Fab-Design AM1000s as well</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- TMJ has a yellow GTO, that one could probably be the same one, sent here to SG for maintenance and/or repairs</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- 40th Anniv. Murcielago - where is it now? Haven't seen it since it left the dealer..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Gemballa GTR650 is a M'sian one - only one in the region - seen it at Sepang once</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Viper - where's that from? I know in Thailand you can drive those.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- '59 Caddy - yes, a M'sian reg'd car - bearing "fake" US plates "ELVIS".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- <strong>KOENIG F48</strong>, not KOENIGSEGG F348. Koenig, full name "Koenig Specials", is a well-known Ferrari tuner, in existence since the early 80s. They have been quite dead now - the last time they made a project was in 2001 when they created a new tune kit for the 550 Maranello, but they have tuned outrageous cars in the 80s and early 90s - Countachs, Diablos, F-50s, F355, 911s, AMGs, Jaguars, etc. This very special Koenig F48 is based on a Ferrari 348TB, with a widebody kit and downforce spoiler and new wheels. Looks like the Ferrari F40 from a side view. Highly tuned engine - goes way beyond 200mph packs 550bhp.  $300,000US+ new, probably more now. A collector's car.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers mate. Always great looking at all the pics here.</p>

              <p>Anyway, Vanq, cool photos you got there.</p>
              <p>And to n0x, I used to post pictures of cars when I was in Singapore, but any interesting cars I find here (in Sydney), I can't bear not to share it in a forum I've enjoyed posting my photos at for quite a while. Notice that I don't post Gallardos, F430s, 360 Modenas Murcielagos &amp; any common  rare car, or rather common EXOTIC car, one can find on Orchard Road. Just the ones that I haven't seen blasting around Singapore.</p>

              <p>Cool. This proves my point that not all photos on this thread are taken in Singapore :). And most importantly, the last thread had more talk and less photos, even becoming a handphone thread at one point.</p>
              [EDIT] Taken down! I won't post photos from Sydney then. :)[/EDIT]
              <p>Anyway, here's a Hummer H3 I spotted. Didn't have my dSLR then.</p>

              <p>Nice pics Vanquish, just a few things to add =</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- The red Zonda now belongs to the Crown Prince of Johor, aka "TMJ"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Their royal family bought two Fab-Design AM1000s as well</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- TMJ has a yellow GTO, that one could probably be the same one, sent here to SG for maintenance and/or repairs</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- 40th Anniv. Murcielago - where is it now? Haven't seen it since it left the dealer..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Gemballa GTR650 is a M'sian one - only one in the region - seen it at Sepang once</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Viper - where's that from? I know in Thailand you can drive those.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- '59 Caddy - yes, a M'sian reg'd car - bearing "fake" US plates "ELVIS".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- <strong>KOENIG F48</strong>, not KOENIGSEGG F348. Koenig, full name "Koenig Specials", is a well-known Ferrari tuner, in existence since the early 80s. They have been quite dead now - the last time they made a project was in 2001 when they created a new tune kit for the 550 Maranello, but they have tuned outrageous cars in the 80s and early 90s - Countachs, Diablos, F-50s, F355, 911s, AMGs, Jaguars, etc. This very special Koenig F48 is based on a Ferrari 348TB, with a widebody kit and downforce spoiler and new wheels. Looks like the Ferrari F40 from a side view. Highly tuned engine - goes way beyond 200mph packs 550bhp.  $300,000US+ new, probably more now. A collector's car.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for the info. Most of the cars at AM actually belongs to TMJ. He probably just leave it there because his garage has no more space.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for the correction for the name. I search on the net and all sort of names came out. It's really very misleading with all the different names pple come up with. Great info there.</p>

              <p>Vanquish- your photog skills are really good man. I will try to answer some of the doubts</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MB 300SL AMG- That car really looks old but in fact it's NEW. Yup, its specially built for the Sultan of Brunei by AMG. That's why it cost 3m</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lambo Murci 40th anni- Never saw this car again. Really wanna see it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pontiac GTO- This car belongs to TMJ. I've got the pic of it in TMJ plates.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jag XJ220- As far as I know, this car belongs to TMJ once again. I've got the pic of the car in TMJ plates. It once is the most expensive car in SG for 3m back in the 1990s.</p>
              <p> </p>
