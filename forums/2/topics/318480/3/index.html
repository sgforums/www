              <p>Wow. 2 more XJ220s? What colour? I only know a silver one in AM that also belongs to TMJ. How about the other 2? Who do they belong to. Oh yeah and rumours had it that there is also a red Mclaren F1 inside it. It belongs to the Sultan Of Brunei. Dunno if it's still there or not. Good luck in finding the pics. I think it will be very hard though since it's a top secret.</p>

It seems that the fella took the pics secretly. They mention that place is at Malayan Motors. I forgot to save that photo. Damn</p>

              <p>Hmm. Really a mystery. I also remembered seing a pic of a red/maroon XJ220 somewhere in a forum. The place is dark and the car iscovered. The pic is not that clear though. It seems that the fella took the pics secretly. They mention that place is at Malayan Motors. I forgot to save that photo. Damn</p>

              <p>some old pics of a silver XJ220. I dont know if this belogs to TMJ (son of Sultan of Johor). Its parked at Malayan motors for a very long time. The covered car next to it is supposedly a red Mclaren F1 (#004 or #021). so there are 2 silver XJ220s? One at Malayan motors and one at AM?</p>
