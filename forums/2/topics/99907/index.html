Here's a part where i'm usually lost, if i should i choose to sell the car after a year, what would i be looking at? Eg, what happens to the loan; would i make a substantial loss; considerations you veterans make; etc..<br><br>2) thanks for the figure, looks like it came processed with a 10.5% interest from the $26K pricetag. Maybe it would be wise for me to go toss in a 20% downpayment..<br><br>3) How did you arrive at the PARF? is it fixed?<br><br>4a) uh, i don't seem to see the use of the OMV figure.. maybe i shouldn't bother about it?<br><br>4b) The depreciation figure, how does it come about and how does it affect the consumer? From your example, it seems to fluctuate, differ car to car.<br><br>Once again, thanks for the assistance, your friend's fortunate to have your help.</div>
