Good for you know what...... hehe<br><br>So, if you are a gadget freak (oh forgot to say it has a cooler in the glove compartment too) this is the car you are looking for.

READ. I SAID I LIKED THE CAR DIDN'T I?<br>i dun always judge my liking for cars on power alone u know. I state facts. And the fact is that the Megane IS underpowered. but then I still like it.<br>So i cannot state if i think a car is underpowered or not?<br>BIG DIFFERENCE between me saying its underpowered and me saying i hate it.<br>Dun jump to conclusions that I dislike it simply because i think its underpowered. If u read my 1st post in this thread, u'll see i have stated simply that i like it, and why so.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
