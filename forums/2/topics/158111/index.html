Amenities include lighted exterior door handles, the uber cool liquid that goes up when you set the cruise control on and not too mention how the audio will increase in volume as you speed up relative to the interior noise. However, it still falls short to the luxurious C-class. If it were not for the horrific design of the new 3, I would not have chosen the Audi A4. The new Audi is so much more macho-looking. I'd go for the new Audi anyday over the 4-door 3 series.</div>

Another moment, engine problems. The problem is your failure to clarify your question.</div>
