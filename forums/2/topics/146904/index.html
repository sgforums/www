            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Well... it will be cheaper to own a Kangoo or VW Caddy type of van and furthermore, it runs on diesel...which is cheaper than petrol...<br><br>However, you've gotta consider, a Kangoo van's speed limit is 60~70kmph... while a car can go up to 90kmph... so... although it's cheaper to get a van... but you gotta drive slowly and patiently to get to your destination... or else, you'll be the target of traffic police...<br><br>So I guess if you dun mind the speed limit, I guess owning a van is a cool choice.<br><br>If I were you, I'd also consider the Ssangyong Musso double cab... it's a SUV/pickup vehicle, really cool, 4x4...Diesel...haha..but quite ex I think..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys, i hav the same thinking as deep_dreamer now. thought of getting a van, either kangoo or berlingo... wonder if there is any van owners out there who can give us their views?? i'm actually looking at 2nd hand ones that are around 3-4 yrs old.. tats even cheaper... and for mileage wise, i heard a full tank kangoo can cover up to 700km+!! and a combo can do 600km+!! and best of all, full tank at most cost only $40!! road tax is cheap at $500/year!! oh man, i dun mind travelling 70km/h in the centre lane...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>i'm quite keen on this: <a href="http://page.auctions.yahoo.com/sg/auction/90468332" rel="nofollow">http://page.auctions.yahoo.com/sg/auction/90468332</a><br><br>but i heard from a fren that kangoo bought 4-5 yrs ago may have lots of problem internally... cheap though.</div>

Still greater gains are to be found slightly lower down the rev range. At 3,492 rpm power is increased by 93 bhp, and at 3,377 rpm torque is increased by 187 Nm.<br><br>Â“These huge gains in power and torque make this one of our most impressive conversions ever,Â” said Superchips managing director, Ian Sandford. Â“In many cases we achieve gains of 30 per cent and more, which is impressive enough, but with the Racing Caddy we've almost doubled that.Â”<br><br>Sam Roach, managing director of Volkswagen Racing UK, added: Â“This is the most powerful diesel engine we have ever put on a circuit. The majority of the components are exactly as the road-going Caddy, but we've done a lot of work to the rear suspension to ensure strong handling.Â”<br><br>The Racing Caddy, which is also fitted with a bespoke exhaust system by Milltek, was unveiled at the Birmingham Motor Show. Immediately afterwards it headed for its first outing at Snetterton in the fifth and sixth rounds of the VW Racing Cup, where it made an encouraging track debut in the hands of Peter Wyhinny, director of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles. Out of 27 entrants, the Caddy qualified 15th on the grid and finished 17th in the first race and 12th in the second.<br><br>Anyone who owns a road-going VW Caddy TDI can benefit from power and torque gains of 30 per cent, for a cost of just Â£511.13 including VAT. Hundreds of other diesel and petrol models can also be Superchipped, and the cost for a non-turbo (normally aspirated) engine is only Â£293.75 including VAT. </span><br><br></div>
