Most people take design and feel into account. No matter how much hype Lexus has been getting for its quality and etc, the interior still feels cheap in my hands. Right down from the buttons and the stalk located at the steering wheel. Every touch has that Toyota accents.<br><br>There are also plenty of other reasons why some chose the S-class, A8 or 7-series over the LS 430 due to the nightvision technology, door closing assist, Bang and Olufsen audio option or the wise iDrive and etc.</div>

Besides I owned all three.<br><br>Now if you want to do that comparison, GRS190 GS300 vs E60 530 vs W211 320. I think it is better to do a comparison with like models in terms of engine rather than price.<br><br>I still come back with the feeling that the BMW is the most satisfying to drive. Somehow as hard as Lexus try, they still just cannot get it. The newer W211 is a much better drive than the old E210, sharper responses and more agile chasis make it more "sporty" but still a merc is a merc and they are not know to be drivers cars.<br><br>The GRS190 while improved from the JZS160, still is how can you say... not as good as the BMW... the benchmark in this sector has and always will be the BMW 5 series. What the lexus tries to do is drive like the 5, what it does not do is hit that mark.<br><br>The lexus is too gadety still, while the 5 remains nice easy to use. Though I would say that they both had the same amount of electronics in them, it is the lexus that makes you more aware of it. From a driving standpoint, that is not good.<br><br>Also egromics... nice try but still not cigar. Lexus and merc have not enough side bolster support and thigh support. The driving position is a little weird.<br><br>The steering is a bit too heavy on the lexus and the merc. The lexus has moderately quuick steering, some feedback, but still not enough to provide that connection with my mind and soul, like the BMW can.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, it is a good car, even a very good car, but not a great one. I think it is safe to say that if you look at history, till now, it has only ever told one story... the BMW is the pack leader while the rest try to play catch up. It is a constant story that is echoed by many motoring journalists that there is still something missing with Lexus.<br><br>Viewed in isolation, the lexus is a fine car, put it on a back to back to back, it struggles to make it. Then there is still the question of badging, it is still a toyota and if a toyota is going to cost more than a continental car, I know where I would put my money. The overall feel, from the way the door closes, to the way they designed the boot and dash... the bmw still takes the cake.</div>
