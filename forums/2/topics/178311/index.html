Just thought that the beemer design is nicer.<br><br>But then again, there are bros out there who described Lexus cars as nicer design, better equipments, and better value for money than the Merc and BMW.<br><br>Asking this because my uncle thinking of getting a luxury sedan soon.

The Designo package in Merc are very expensive and better wood trims cost money too. Compared to Lexus, they never offer you all the bells and whistles as standard (not even the more reasonable ones like premium sound system). You compare the Lexus LS and the S-class, and you know what I mean.<br><br>Yes I hate the digital clock too. It seems horribly out of place in a luxury car.</div>

I actually meant that if after all assessments and considerations (i.e. ceteris paribus), and you are down to one of the 2 choices: badging or value-for-money. Which will you go for?<br><br>Hee I draw a very crude analogy: If you are choosing between 2 brands of plasma TV (e.g. "Pioneer" and "Funny-Name-Never-Hear-Before" ) which gives about the same quality, with pros and cons in each, will you go for Pioneer (cos when people come to your house they go "Whoa! You got Pioneer!" ), or will you go for Mr. Never-Hear-Before (bcos it comes with nicer colors, faster response time, higher quality and durability, and cheap! And best of all, throw in a free home theatre system!)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it all depends on what you are looking for in a car.<br><br>Not everyone is interested in a car that can go fast round corners, with a stiff and sporty suspension and sports car like acceleration/soundtrack.<br>In fact i believe the majority of potential buyers who can actually fork out 300k for a car are accomplished middle-age men who are more interested in a car that can provide a luxurious, quiet and comfortable ride. In which case, what better option than a Lexus (especially the LS430)?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Of course, those who are concerned with image may opt for a S350 at a slightly higher price, and those for performance will probably go for a BMW.<br><br>Personally, i'd go for the new GS300.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anywayz, had some discussion with some other bros somewhere else.<br><br>They did not agree that Merc or BMW supercede the Lexus in many areas. E.g. they heard stories abot the E-class and S-Class with the inherent suspension problems (need to change very early), Active Steering that over-compensate (and cause accidents instead of preventing them), and the E-Class throttle map being screwed up when you press the brake together with the accelerator pedal, etc...<br><br>And comparing between a GS300 and say... 523. Both at about the same price of $190k (GS300) and $200k (523i). The GS300 is more torquey, 55 more HP, comes with more gadgets. So why does people chiong BMW more than Lexus? You sure they know so much about cars that they arrived at a conclusion that the BMW is technically superior? Don't think so... For me, I will go for BMW because of its badging (You know? The kind of feeling you get when a girl sees your car and goes "Wow! You own a BM? Shall we hump?" and the feeling you get when your long-lost friends shout at you and say "Nbz CB! You own a BM? You dog!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  ).<br><br>I know some guys will think that comparing the 523 to the GS300 is not correct because the GS300 is 700cc more (about la. hee hee) than the 523. But that's precisely the point! At a $10k savings, a Lexus buyer gets a larger car, better build (c'mon, you can't fault the build quality of a Jap car, can you?), more gadgets, blah blah blah. Especially in the present context of Sillypore, I feel that comparing prices might be also a good guide.<br><br>Are most BMW, or Merc owners like me - sucker for badging?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
