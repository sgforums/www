            <div class='col-md body'>um.. im a singaporean studying abroad, currently the equivalent of JC, and i have a driving license (i'm 16 btw), when i go back (quite frequent), am i permitted to drive? from the LTA web they state that as long as the license is in english, i am allowed to drive. but i am afraid that TP will summon me say i underage. so the main question is : "for foreign drivers license, will age be taken into consideration?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) A singaporean cannot use a foreign license to drive in Singapore, this rule applies also for PRs and Employment Permit/Work Permit holders.<br><br>2) Singapore law only allows ppl above 18 to drive in Singaproe. So regardless if you are licensed overseas, it is still illegal for under 18 to drive.<br><br>3) Penalty for using foreign license to drive, first time is warning and confiscation of foreign license.<br><br>4) Penalty for under 18 driving in singapore, owner of car gets into trouble and depending on the severity, it might be a criminal offence for the driver.<br><br>5) So much so, your being licensed might be a mitigating factor in the sentence you receive. because a trained driver driving is better than an untrained driver driving.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to add....  in case you still want to drive in singapore using a foreign license.  the chain reaction you will create...<br><br>since you are under 18, it is illegal to drive, therefore it voids the insurance of the car.<br><br>Driving an uninsured vehicle is an offence.<br><br>Owner of the car is liable for being sued for allowing another person to drive knowing that person driving it voids the insurance.<br><br>you, being the underaged driver, first have your license confiscated, you might or might not be banned from driving for a number of years, and your privilege of converting license in future would be fortfeited (meaning you can no longer convert but have to go thru entire sequence just like any other singaporean)<br><br>bottom line is, as much as you want to be that special 16 year old who can drive, it is not worth the trouble IF you get into trouble.<br><br>Trust me, my 27 year old friend is was fined $2000 and currently serving a 2 year drive ban after which he must go thru the normal process of obtaining a license. his mom has to drive him to work everyday, and it isn't a very nice sight especially when you are 27 years old going to a date and your mom drives you to your date.<br><br>and my guess is that you are in North America now. PLEASE don't drive when you come back, you need to adjust back to Right hand driving AND you need to get used to driving in SIngaproe, North American drivers are safe drivers, so you tend to be complacent when driving.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys,<br><br>my comment about that conversion to Class 3A only, is just my "educated guess" on past trends. It noway illustrates reality. Just that i somehow predict they will do that.<br><br>I based it on the fact that one has to pass BTT first. And on that people who owns BMW motorbikes or harley bikes overseas and want to convert, can only convert to Class 2B first and slowly make their way to Class 2.<br><br>As for those people who passed overseas with a Manual vehicle, i guess either Traffic Police is kind enough to allow provisions like show evidence you had owned a manual car or the like.<br><br>Or they can just make it like Motorcycles, get your 3A, earn your 3.<br><br>Anyway, all these are speculations.<br><br>One thing is for sure is that i don't think Traffic Police will change the policy of allowing people to convert license as that would make lots of expats unhappy.</div>

This, I see, is lacking in Singapore.<br><br>As much as many people want the minimum age limit raised, Singapore is bounded by a international treaty to which they are a signatory. This UN treaty basically makes one's license universal and that every country is to let people drive at age of 18. This treaty is a 1949 treaty... so back then, world was a different place.<br><br>So i hope i do answer your question on that 16/18 thingy. But don't be offended with my comment as i was generalising. Do keep the road safe and drive safe.</div>

As mentioned, as of now, you can convert a foreign license to Class 3 after passing the Theory Test.<br><br>The requirements are simple,<br>a) have a foreign license,<br>b) have an extract from the authorities that you have been driving for more than 1 year and that you were never banned from driving.<br>c) Have a valid reason to be overseas (studying, working, etc). This is to prevent people from going overseas just to pass a driving test. Usually evidence needed are, School results, Exit Permits, Visas issued, etc.<br>d) pass theory test<br><br>To your 2nd question, Nope.  If you are suitable for a combat vocation, you are more likely to go there than being a driver. Having a license has no impact on your vocation because SAF has their own driving standards which you have to pass anyway.<br><br>And they will only take into account your license only if you have the Singapore one. The only "privilege" you will get is that you only need to take the SAF's driving test without going thru the course to be allowed to drive the Land Rovers.<br><br>However, i advice you against this, since it just takes the inconvenience away from your superior officers from indenting a driver everytime, you will be his driver instead. And trust me, it's a 4am to 1am job during exercises.</div>
