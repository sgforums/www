            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sheltie2306:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey friend, I had the same pissed off encounter today, traveling on TPE exiting to Jalan Kayu.  I was traveling at 90 in the middle lane.  When I signal left, there a car on the left lane at least 3-4 car length away simply speed up trying to block me.  I simple pressed my right foot and over took him to exit.  Then suddenly, I saw the blinking light and I was kena stop after the exit, he claimed to clock me at 121km/h, <span style="color: red;">but I was quite certain that I was far beyond that</span>.  With our kind of car, accelerate from 90 to 121 is simply 1-2 sec of effort  and that bloody fellow make it sounds like something dam bloody sinful like that.  I do not deny the technical fact that I was speeding, but he was behind the other car, and for sure that fellow exceeded the speed limit too, but why must he target at me instead of the other car.<br><br>To help boost his ego, I called him Â“sirÂ” all the way and said Â“sorryÂ”.  He finally felt dam ego boosted and gave me $150 fine and 6 points, and sounds like he gave me a great discount.  What the Â“fÂ” is $150, I am probably paying more income tax per month then his whole bloody monthly pay.  The Â“fÂ”ing TP say what the Â“fÂ” about road safety, what the Â“fÂ” of all his bloody holly job duty, simply, he need to boost his ego.<br><br>Let me tell the Â“fÂ”ker .. bloody Balamxxxxx  Â… what ever the Â“fÂ” you are Â… you are just a bloody failure small fly in this socialty that has not position with bloody low income.  May be you are lucky that you are a TP now, but you are still dam nothing.  Few years later when your contract is over, you will be dam pitiful that your income can hardly feed you family and your child and you will struggle for the rest of you life seeing all the fast car zooming past you Â… and you Â… probably you canÂ’t even afford a 2nd hand car.    Go Â“fÂ” your own ego, Mr. Balamxxxxx<br></div></blockquote>TP usually gives an allowance of +10 km/h (but there are some really strict ones) and since u said both of u were initially travelling at 90km/h the car next to u probably speed up to 100km/h while u overtook him by more than 121km/h (u were quite certain that u were far beyond that) hence if u minus off the allowances given, u would have been deemed to be the one speeding... I know your car is really powerful and reaching excess of 100km/h is an easy feat but that's no excuse to speed so much that if the TP had clocked u for your original speed (&gt; 121km/h), u would have been summoned to courts... The TP only has one car/bike, and he can only book one vehicle at one time. By comparison with the car next to you, your speed is deemed to be "insanity"... I admit that I am no saint on the road, but well just live on and accept the fact that u've been rightfully booked...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So if u have been part fo the group that wasn't caught, u would have been in the group that have been lucky to escape. Since u were caught, there's nuttin to complain since u have indeed broken the rule... Its just purely a matter of he see who first then catch who lo... u can't expect him to multiply himself and start catching every offender at one go... Whenever we escape from punishment for doing something wrong, it is considered as lucky, but when we get punished, its something that we just deserve and not simply we are unlucky or anything... Yes there was a whole lot of cars who have committed the same offence, and yes perhaps he has indeed specially picked on u to catch u first, but in the first place if u had done no wrong, he would have no chance to pick on u at all</div>
