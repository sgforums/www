            <div class='col-md body'>That's the thing isn't it?  Does it matter that much if you signal or not?  Sometimes you signal, idiots will deliberately speed up to prevent you from switching lanes.  On the other hand, am I supposed to signal when it is crystal clear that the car behind me is a good distance away and travelling at a slower speed?<br><br>I had a 10 minutes drive to my friend's place this afternoon and made an observation of at least 20 instances of cars switching lanes without signalling, but they were all done reasonably and safely.  One guy signalled to cut in front of a lorry on the right and nearly caused an accident because immediately after he signalled, he just cut into the other lane as if that was his god-given right.<br><br>But I know it wasn't about my driving.  It was about my car, and the TP couldn't have been more obvious about it.</div>

I was traveling at 90 in the middle lane.  When I signal left, there a car on the left lane at least 3-4 car length away simply speed up trying to block me.  I simple pressed my right foot and over took him to exit.  Then suddenly, I saw the blinking light and I was kena stop after the exit, he claimed to clock me at 121km/h, but I was quite certain that I was far beyond that.  With our kind of car, accelerate from 90 to 121 is simply 1-2 sec of effort  and that bloody fellow make it sounds like something dam bloody sinful like that.  I do not deny the technical fact that I was speeding, but he was behind the other car, and for sure that fellow exceeded the speed limit too, but why must he target at me instead of the other car.<br><br>To help boost his ego, I called him Â“sirÂ” all the way and said Â“sorryÂ”.  He finally felt dam ego boosted and gave me $150 fine and 6 points, and sounds like he gave me a great discount.  What the Â“fÂ” is $150, I am probably paying more income tax per month then his whole bloody monthly pay.  The Â“fÂ”ing TP say what the Â“fÂ” about road safety, what the Â“fÂ” of all his bloody holly job duty, simply, he need to boost his ego.<br><br>Let me tell the Â“fÂ”ker .. bloody Balamxxxxx  Â… what ever the Â“fÂ” you are Â… you are just a bloody failure small fly in this socialty that has not position with bloody low income.  May be you are lucky that you are a TP now, but you are still dam nothing.  Few years later when your contract is over, you will be dam pitiful that your income can hardly feed you family and your child and you will struggle for the rest of you life seeing all the fast car zooming past you Â… and you Â… probably you canÂ’t even afford a 2nd hand car.    Go Â“fÂ” your own ego, Mr. Balamxxxxx<br></div></blockquote>well, if $150 is peanut to u and that u pay much more than tat for income tax, why the whinning?<br><br>it does not matter how his life will be then after his contract ends, but now we know how short-fused and illogical you are, being rich does not make u the right to drive in an unsafe manner...dun say others are doing it...just look at yourself first...before u start to say others... let this b a lesson, if it ever b a lesson to your ego too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

If you are not happy with the tp officer the best thing to do legaly is to get his name, his bike number down. Do not fight with him when he book you, just pretend to say nice things or else the more points he gives you the more u kena.<br><br>If u are rich, call a lawyer to sue him, if not u can go to the complain department to complain about him.<br>The more complains he have, the less chances of him getting promoted.<br><br>Singapore tp still respect the law but they are only human. They got mouths to fed as you and me.  They need to fullfill their qouta every month, or else they will kena complain. Is a job nothing personal.</div>
