            <div class='col-md body'>A friend of mine told me he once crashed a police car for entering a  restricted area.  The police officer of that car came out &amp; scolded him for being blind, not seeing the police car.  The worst part was that when her superior turn up to investigate, he concluded that my friend was not a Singaporean &amp; was most likely sleeping on the job.  They also concluded that my friend should pay for the damages.  Of course, my friend challenged the police for their investigation to prove that he was not carrying out his duties given by the police commander himself.  It turns out that the police themselves did not read about the order from their commander that even police vehicle entering that area had to stop &amp; be checked before enterring.<br><br>By the way, my friend is a Singaporean with 6+years in the army before he left &amp; worked in a security company that posted him to that secured area.  So unlike those police officers, I'm very sure my friend knew how to follow orders given.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Houndy..<br>There will always be some PPls who only see things from their own point of views. They will never appreciate the fact that they are able to walk in the street late at night safely. Instead they took it for granted.<br>Some PPls, when they dun need Cops' assistance will treat them like dogs. When they need help from Cops, U should have seen their total change in attitude <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>So, to CopsRDogs, pls do pray hard that U will not need Police's help at any point of time in your life. And if U really wana catch Cops loafing around and breaking the law, U r welcome to do that.<br>For general info, Policemen pay tax too..<br>BTW, why dun you submit your initial post to Straits Times Forum? It will generate a lot of interest.</div>
