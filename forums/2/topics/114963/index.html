So if you get it new, it is cheaper than the above example by $30/month.<br><br>Anyway, doing a reverse calculation, you can afford any car at the price of $51373. 10-year loan, 2.45% interest, 8k down payment. So you do the maths.<br>------------------------------<br>Calculation:<br>(450 * 12 * 10 divided by 1.245) + 8000.<br>------------------------------<br>Think Getz and Aveo also within your range. Maybe Accent, Rio too.</div>

However, you renew the COE and decides drive the same car for another 10 years, then at the end of the 20th year after the 2nd COE expires, you get back nothing. Of course if you decide to sell the car between the 10th to the 20th year, you get back some money for the 2nd COE that you paid.<br><br>The depreciation looks something like this:<br>Depreciation for 10 years= 2nd COE + Scrap Value<br>Depreciation per year = 2nd COE + Scrap Value / 10 years<br><br></div>
