            <div class='col-md body'>Toyota Wish is currently only available from parallel importers. I think it cost around 80k (not sure). It's 1.8 litre with 7 seats. So it's a MPV. FC wise should be quite good for a 1.8 though i am not sure of the exact figures. Its quite spacious except for the last row. If you ask me if it's a nice car, i say yes.<br><br>But before you rush to the showrooms. Let me warn you, Toyota Wish are getting more common among taxis. So if you don't want a car that is the same model of taxis, i suggest getting another non taxi model like picnic or something. Honda Stream is also a taxi model if you don't know.<br><br>But if you don't mind having the same car as the taxi, then by all means, go buy it. It's a good car.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would just say, if u can comfortably set aside 1.2k - 1.5k a month for the car, you should be able to buy it, no probs. It also depends on how much u downpay, and the loan period u take. Thus far max loan period u can take is 10 years, or the length of the COE.<br><br>Forgive me if I'm wrong, but judging from the questions you are asking, I don't think your financially ready to own a car yet.</div>
