            <div class='col-md body'>Bro.. these ppl keep their cars on the road paying lots of $$..<br><br>Depends on which year you getting, the 12A are usually easier to maintain without electronic fuel injection.<br><br>The later year 13B/13B turbo are fuel injected.  Turbo versions are more troublsome.. it makes the normally unreliable rotary engines even worse.. handle the boost with care.<br><br>You need to check if the previous owners did any major mods to their engines.  Some have aftermarket ECU such as "microtec", ported engines and stuff installed.  You need to be careful with these.  Try to get something as orginal as possible.<br><br>There are some workshops claiming to be rotary engine "specialist", evulate them carefully... or you may find workshop visits and tow truck rides becoming familar events.<br><br>Oh yes, hope you are aware of the FC..<br><br>Gd luck pal..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>Unfortunately, there is not much of rx-7's on the road much less on sale, thus patience is needed to look for the right one.<br><br>To buy one here is kinda like undertaking a project. It is not like any other car that you buy and drive and leave it at that.<br><br>Know what you would one out of the car, is it for daily driving, or is it for leisure maybe as a second car for weekends? Do you want to keep it stock or have it as a project car and do it up.....? either way, please set aside at least $5k to $10k to change some parts if required......... above the buying price. This is not for any modification purpose, rather to ensure that the car will be upkept  and running smoothly, of cos what i might have quoted are for extreme cases......<br><br>I would suggest to look for an rx-7 with a good chassis, body and interior (i.e. accident free), because even if the owner was a careful driver, the rotary engine as wonderful as it is, has a shorter life span than a piston engine and will eventually wear away. As you know it, most rx-7s here are already more than 10 years old unless you want to get the fd spirit-r here which there should be only one.<br><br>Engine parts as with all older cars will eventually wear away, thus thats where the $5k to $10k comes in...... as always said dun wait till parts fails to change, change it early if you can.......<br><br>Anyways, the rx-7, like all passionate relationship, if taken care properly will go a long way and will be a car that you makes you fall in love driving it, but if you expect it to be a slave for you and treat it like a car just for driving and neglect it will otherwise, it will most probably throw tantrums which you will not forget....hee!!!!<br><br>P.S. you getting the SA22, FC or FD?<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>Hopes this helps........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
