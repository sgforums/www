            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kr0n:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm... Just curious, if you have 1 supercharger than 1 turbocharger, your SC does the job of boosting your low end already. What happens when your TC takes over? Aren't you going to be wasting some of the power produced to continue powering the SC? Unless there is some system to disconnect the SC's power requirements, and supposing your engine is not going to be configured that way, won't your ECU need to be tuned again to get an optimal AFR? You might end up running too lean in the higher revs isn't it?<br><br>Anyone please shed some light!! Thanks!</div></blockquote>no worries with boost on the supercharger when the turbo comes on song at higher rpms. new aftermarket SCs come with a clutch system much like those found on ur air con compressors which can be electronically engaged (boost on) and disengaged (boost off). with a suitably wired ecu, the computer can be made to set a "switchover" point, when the SC switches off/ disengage its connection with the pulley and starts to read the boost from the TC to moderate the a/f mix. nothing is impossible with a bit of electronic trickery, provided u have the expertise and the rite hardware/software 2 do it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Were tested by some manusfacturers. Honda i think, on the integra. but i was for testing only.<br><br>your objective is to boost torque thru'out the rev range.  a successfully applied set up is the sequential turbo route. One smaller and another bigger turbo.<br>Smaller turbo works from low RPM, then at mid range,the biger turbo takes over.  Legacy GT and the BMW 3.0 diesel are using such a system. i think the bmw's is very good.  Look out for the petrol 3.0l turbo from bmw,uses the same 1+ urbo as the diesel! they say it shld make at least 330bhp. with a lot of porsche killing torque= ripping in gear accel.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>have you heard of torque multiplying effect by using low gearing ratios? that's why matching torque characteristics to gear ratios is impt. that's why the new m5 can match the e55's 0-100 time despite having way less torque, but matching it to the right ratios.</div>

In fact the reason they push for high revs is because the engines are limited to a certain capicity, but bhp is not limited, hence the only way to obtain more bhp are thru high revs. A good tractable engine with a useful torque band is the ultimate holy grail of race engine engineering.</div>
