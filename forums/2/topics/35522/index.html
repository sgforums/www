            <div class='col-md body'>saw in a car mag...that when u break a new car...u do it until u reach 1000km or something....some kS ppl do it till 5000km....anyway from what the mag says...u have to change the engine oil to remove all the debris when yr engine is on....otherwise they will cause an imprefect seal ...in short..low engine power....<br><br>then when u rev the car...rev to 3/4 of the rpm range will do.....and also dun treat it like it's a race car...don exert it or stress it hard during the break in period</div>

I think once you go over 3000RPM which most 1.6 liter cars touch at 120km/hr, it will be considered as speeding, not morally or legally, but for the car. Maybe this will affect your pistons to seal in a way that allows higher engine acclimatization to performance instead of fuel efficiency and smoothness? That's what I deduced.. I mean a runner is a runner a sprinter is a sprinter?<br><br>I prefer keeping it at 90 cos my new car is around 2000+ at that speed, and that's the limit anyway.. I am pretty stuck on the idea that 2500-3000RPM at 80-100km/hr is where your engine is comfortable cruising, provided you warmed up the car properly of course.</div>
