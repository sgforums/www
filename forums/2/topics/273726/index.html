You must always signal before moving off. Since you're moving off the slope, you MUST signal right, check mirrors and blindspot then move off. No such thing as don't want to signal don't signal. Immediately after moving off then you turn off your signal lah! Then signal left if you wana turn left thereafter.<br><br>2. That one all depends on ur judgement and the car you're using.</div>

For the same car, the distance can vary and u can still park it properly.  Its not the distance I guess. Its about adjusting as you reverse into the slot.</div>

No need to change gear as the instructor will ask you to move off immediately after u manage to get the car stationary.<br><br>When he asks you to move off, do your moving off drill first, step on accelerator, release ur clutch gradually till after biting point then disengage handbrake. Step on the accelerator more after that to move the car up the slope or it will roll.</div>
