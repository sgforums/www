(My philosophy is if you are so lazy to even signal, why should I give way to you).<br><br>On the other hand, we should always give way or make space to those who signal their intention, especially during peak hour traffic.<br><br>I believe drivers here should try to create some space for each other and respect the signal light.

            <div class='col-md body'>becos they were taught that signalling lights the bulbs very fast burn out one, and very expensive to replace also, so must save on signalling light usage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I feel that Malaysian drivers are better...<br>If you travel on the North South highway, you will understand why...<br><br>they respect the signals and they never road hog.<br>They know they are slower they will surely give way to you.<br>You signal right and let them know that you are overtaking, they will move left.<br><br>Singaporeans...<br>You signal that you want to change lane, he will step on it and go closer to the car infront so that you got no space to go in...<br><br>Turn right and go straight lane at red light junction, and you signal that you turning right.  He still want to stop behind you but he going straight.  Then cannot tahan the wait.  Horn and high beam you.<br><br>Road hog on expressway and then kena high beam, not happy... jam brakes!!!<br><br>wa lan ...<br><br>Singaporeans in Malaysia worse... that why they call us aliens from the south.<br>Road hog, people high beam still don't want to give way.<br><br>I think Singaporeans should learn their 'highway code' on the malaysian highway...<br>the spirit of giving way, signalling and not road hogging.</div>

The most common is that they do not obey traffic lights.<br>As tourists, one tends to see the better of the behaviour within the boudaries of that country. The driving behaviour is just as bad in every country.<br>There is seriously no way to stop such behaviours.... even with fines systems intact people still mis behaved themselves on the road.

Sometime i see Super4 squeezing through the cars at &lt;60kmph in the expressway, really want to show them the finger. </strong>[/b]</blockquote>Personally I feel that we should make it a habit to signal regardless if there are car or not. I think that by doing that it will make driving less complicated.</div>
