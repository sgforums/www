People here read and knows....<br><br>And i never say all honda cars is ah beng.... i say its ppl like you show spoilt honda image as i did mention i also do like some models of Honda....<br><br>Pickup? still no mention?  We dont want bragging here.... we want stat and proof of tested!!! I gave my proof but you?... never.<br><br>You are the one who mention modified cars so other can also kind of follow suit into other makes of modified cars. You started it first....<br>JDM model Jazz with i-vtec 220hp? well i never heard before but i do see Wira with 280hp from VR4 engine.<br>Kancil with 130hp but at the weight of 600++kg surely beat Civic in pickup as i mention on Pasir Gudang as those Civics there are 220 hp but weight more than a ton.<br><br>Ya.... for mugen, the owner has sold off the company.<br><br>Fyi 220hp honda engine is mostly from factories in UK.... not "beng" like mugen... too bad.

Because "beng" only know civic, city, integra.... pls widen your knowledge.<br><br>What about fuel consumption? no stats for us?<br><br>STOCK City is surely a bit underpower than Vios but as for handling City is bit better than VIOS as the suspension construct is different.<br><br>Every Jap Cars has Variable Valve Technology now.....

You have a defensive, self centred, agressive, short tempered, stubborn personality. You just wanna win, don't you? You have completely fail to see the whole picture and lost track of the original purpose of this thread.<br>You sole purpose is to show everyone how much knowledge you have of cars, so much that you have made the poor chap who started this thread, who wants an opinion on which car to chose, to be totally confused now.<br>City, Vios, Honda, Toyota, whatever...you want spec, you want road test, you want proof and what do you want to proof end of the day? Do you get a trophy. All these are to feed your ego. Yes, your ego, if only you can prove the other guy wrong.<br>All City, Vios owners knows what their car can do and there will always be endless number of cars that can out perform even the best avaliable now. But I am worried for you. You should get some help soon. Your egoistic state is out of proportion.</div>

They must have tested it to derive the figures. How they test it is another question. For us who owns a City and tested the FC, it can attain 20km/litre, depending on your driving habit.<br><br>So what's your point here? You want to sue Honda for misleading the public?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Practical road tests are somewhat indicative of fuel efficiency, but to a very large degree, this is also determined by the style of driving and the proficiency of the driver.  I have had many experiences in which my dad, who is a miserly driver, can coax 50% more mileage out of the exact same car doing the exact same route, in much the same weather, faster.<br><br>It's really best to try to talk to friends especially those who have the same driving style that you do.<br><br>I've been doing some research as well, as I'm also looking to buy a car in the near future.  I rather think that the Jazz suits me best.  I'm not out to win road races.  I don't really want to bully people on the highway.  I just want a car that takes me to where I'm going whether I'm lugging a surfboard, a couple large people, or a few bikes.  I've looked at the showrooms and went over the cars with a tape measure and some few items of interest.  Jazz wins, hands down.<br><br>It's also been receiving lots of love from the Euro market.</div>

Sorry to have caused sooo much argument.... over a bloody car..  guess since I started this whole damn %@*&amp; topic, guess I should just end it... anyway guys did a test drive on city and vios ( Jazz?? in the car as a passenger once helped decide it was not to be).  Errrr..... Decide to get a Vios (although BM SE attitude sucked big time!!!) even though the cabin of city was much better. Just felt Vios was the better while driving.<br><br>So there ... end of ego trips (or whatever!!!) .

            <div class='col-md body'>No lah, I was never worked up. In fact, I am bemused by all that is being written. Well, I am contented with my ride and enjoying it everyday. That's what matters to each of us when we chose a car. No point having yourself struck inside a car you hate. Even looking at it make you disgusted...hahaha.. like my wife always ask me why I would always stare at my car from my house...I told her...I simply can't stop enjoying the look...<br><br>Anyway, BM SE suxxx big time compared to KM. Hey, my SE still recognise when I go back to the newly renovated KM showroom at Ubi. That's what I call top notch service.</div>
