            <div class='col-md body'>for me, i choose the city.<br><br>if u look beyond the odd design and price, u will see ample leg space, CVT, VTEC !! big boot space, good FC (Jazz is even better), mod-able and ultra seats arrangement.<br>driving wise, it is fun to drive with steromatic on the steering wheel like F1.<br><br>u can check it out in www.shc-forum.com<br><br>hope u get the right choice</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi gasband ! advocating City again huh ??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>ok, correction, City Vtec has the same features of Vios, airbags etc...<br>It also has 110 bhp, same as Vios too, but slightly better cos of Vtec. Check it out at Honda main website.<br>If u can tolerate the centre dashboard of the Vios, then u should be fine.<br><br>True, Vtec is only activated when RPM is hit at certain level, Vios VVT is always on, so u can judge the performance from there. Without Vtec, City is quite fast liao.<br>As for rear passengers, if u are not getting City, I strongly urge u to avoid Vios as well. When I sat in the rear section of the Vios, I have to sit in a 'SBS seat' manner. Very crampy and my head bumped onto the roof.<br>City is really spacious inside.<br><br>In the end, it's your own decision, go and test drive, sit in it, 'rip' the car inside out at the showroom.<br>Do check out the S'pore City website at www.shc-forum.com<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Little Tiger...City Vtec does not work in the same way as City iDSI in terms of max torque. Vtec will kick in at 5500 rpm whilst for iDSI, its full torque will come in at 2700 rpm. This means iDSI has better lower end torque power which is good for city driving. Vtec is for that extra boost. Guess you have to read up about what is toruqe and what is vtec to understand what I am talking about.<br><br>Vios can beat City by 9 seconds? You got to be kidding. A stock iDSI City can beat Vios anytime and not even mentioning a City vtec. Mine you, we are talking about stock, no modification yet. Some bro in the Honda City Club has modification and we are already talking about thrashing higher end car. Vios is not mentioned as it is not worth mentioning.

You drive City surely u say its good. Ah beng...<br>Do u read properly.... Vios pickup is less than 9 seconds... what about CITY? pls give me your stat and figure? If Vios can beat City more than 9 sec then it mean VIOS can 0 ~100km/h in 2 secs meh faster than Mclaren F1? use ur brain to think and understand properly.<br><br>I did mention about top speed of VIOS close to 200km/h TESTED what about CITY??? skip the topics?<br>About thrashin higherend car. Vios pickup and top speed can beat BMW 318, CITY and Civic (as u mention we are talking about stock so not those SIR which are of different class and cc), other 1.5 or 1.6 cc, Accord, CRV, HRV.<br><br>I did mention the Fuel Consumption was tested on spore road, what about CITY? dont dare to mention only say according to the manual... haha...<br>ya..... few yrs back Honda hybrid broke the records from Spore to Thai at average close to 30km/l. But how to they drive? at the average of 40km/h hogging the NS highway and with aircon off and window down.... that was mention in newspaper and magazines, does that count?<br><br>Those you wins one are bcos they are not even choing with you, you are the only one "self thinking".... if i able to cut or over take a ferrari then i say war my car outrun ferrari ah... "siao" outrun auntie, little girl and old folks also consider outrun? hahaha.... i am laughing.<br><br>Toyota,  Nissan and mitsubishi, mazda, subaru got lots of powerful engine. Just that you dont know, VR4, Supra, 3S-GE, GTO, Skyline, Silvia...RX7, WRX..etc.  Honda engine blew the most in compare to other Jap manufacturer.<br>Those ppl want to earn ur $$$ then "jio" you to stick those useless things on your car....  you are "rabbit" and they are fat arse. You drive City they already drive Accord or S2000 liao.<br>Honda drivers like "you" mostly only know how to bullies those smaller cc cars or they put in big engine and lies all the way.<br><br>Go NS highway and those rulez there are not Honda, Its those wira and satria rulez....<br><br>Even those Evos and WRx are not as arrogant as you.<br><br>Kallang mcdonalds?? small bird.... "beng" thinking...  who wanna go down there to see those cars.... its ugly.<br><br>I go down elsewhere to see levin, treno, celica, silvia, mrs, supra gto, skyline or Conti cars like Ferrari, lamboghini, BMW, Merc, Audi, Mclaren..... better still.<br><br>Talk about mod and trash.... go down pasir gudang and you see WIRA and Kancil trashing Civic like sh*t....... Lots of ppl knows...<br><br>FYI... i am not a VIOS owner.... we own car and we love cars but we not brag like you n yours owned car.....  Bcos of ppl like you, spoilt the image of Honda.. City, Civic and Integra.<br>I do like Hondas like the Accord Euro, NSX and S2000 more artistics and beauty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun see why u guys are fighting over whether the vios or city can outrun which when both cars are never constructed for the purpose of outrunning any car.... But the fact is, based on stock cars, a Vios do really have a better pick-up than a i-Dsi City in a 0-100km/h sprint (Vios' darn light body contributes to that)... As for the Vtec City and Vios, I have no comments cos I dun really know (since both have about the same hp, City might have the edge with the vtec?).... btw I drive neither a vios nor a city... kudos guys</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz a question that I always wanna ask (maybe u City drivers can give me an answer) A City has got such a big boot space but such low hp (88 for a i-dsi City), how is the car going to sustain the extreme weight when it is totally full? An Impreza with 90+ hp is already underpowered and has pretty poor pick-up (unless u step hard on the gas)</div>
