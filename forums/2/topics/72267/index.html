            <div class='col-md body'>There is no SLR in Singapore.  The ad was out since the december issue of AutoCar.  Not sure whether there is any car in the showroom in Alexandar as said in the ad, but there is no buyer for this supercar yet.  Maybe your friend saw the SL...<br><br>But there are 2 buyers for the Porsche Carrera GT.  Because its left hand drive, they will be registered in Germany and kept some other country but not Singapore.<br><br>There is also a Singaporean interested in buying a Enzo Ferrari, but not sure whether he qualify.  There is a Enzo Ferrari in the showroom of Hong Seh Motors, not sure whether its still there.  Was still there when I went there on 18/01/2004.  Managed to take only 1 shot of that beautiful car.<br><br>Went to Aston Martin showroom but can't see anything except this Toyota Corolla with a nice number SCP1C.<br><br>Most expensive car in Singapore still the Jaguar XJ220.  Its OMV is already S$1,000,000 when it was sold in 1991.  There is still one in Singapore but the owner de-registered it.  Its parked together with a Ferrari F50 in a secret location.<br><br>Really like to see the Pagani Zonda.  Not sure of the exact location of the showroom except its in Changi.  Can someone tell me???  Will the sales rep really entertain you there?</div>
