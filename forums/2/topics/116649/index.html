            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all<br><br>happy new yr in advance.<br><br>Let me relate an accident (should i call it accident?!?!) yesterday along a small street in Jurong east.<br><br>I was travelling behind a civic driven by an old man (40s). was not too close or so I tot as theer were so many cars along the road. He braked so suddenly that my car had a "kiss" with his. We got down. There were no damage or visible scratch or damage. I told him it would be good to go to the side.<br><br>He got down. Squated down and started to PUSH his bumper in out in out. I asked him what the hell he is doing. He obviously trying to do some damage to his car. He said no and he is merely trying to check if his METAL inside his bumper is damaged. I told him this is ridiculous.<br><br>He then began to raise his voice and accused me that I am driving very fast behind him. I asked him FAST??? No vehicle even a ferrari can drive fast at such a crowded road! He raised his voice in front of on lookers that I am pointing fingers at him now.<br><br>I told him no and I apologized to him that I banged into him but since there was no damage at all. There is nothing much I should do and even offered and offered to exchange details with him. He shouted and said he wanted to call police. PISSED OFF. He obviously want to get something out from me. NO WAY! I told him alright. Call the police then but I won't wait for police to come because police will not handle it.<br><br>He shouted again and started to repeat what he said and POLICE, this time, he added his gesture by pointing fingers at me. I told him this does not warrant such action from him since we are "educated". Damn pissed off this time, used a hard approach.<br><br>Apologized again but added, "call the police now but I won;t wait" and i walked towards my car. He just walked off and drove his car away.<br><br>Called up insurance. Adv me to report to prevent this guy from meddling his car and claimed from me subsequently and I did so immeidately!<br><br>I have to add again that there is no denial that I bang his car but there was no damage and I offered to exchange details but he din wan to accept.<br><br>SO BE WARE OF SUCH PEOPLE&gt; DUN GET TAKEN IN BY THEM.</div>

Still your fault, face it.<br><br>As for the damage, there can be interdamage which cannot be seen from surface. I been bang by some one from behind before, outside seem ok , but inside is totally screwed. I send to IDA , the folks advice is just send the car for verification. Here is what the IDA person told me - the problem is you can take all the photo you want and it will be useless, as it show only the surface, one way to be sure, and fair to both parties, just send down the car to IDA for inspection the same day. They will do a fair check, which check for internal damages.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, you have to keep a safe distance from the car in front. Once you bang someone's backside, you are almost always in the wrong. Even if the guy cut your lane dangerously, its hard to prove tat. (I think in this case better accelerate and let him whack your side, easier to prove its his fault...haha)<br><br>Also, no external damage does not mean the chassis has no damage.. it can happen.. reverse sensor spoilt is a possibility also, so not necessarily they are cheating.<br><br>Also, the claim amount is not set by the driver, the workshop (even though nowadays they are 'authorised') like to claim high price, otherwise its the cost of original parts is ridiculously high, so the claims are always ballooned even for small items. Not really the driver's fault.<br><br>Before accusing the fella you banged into, pls reflect on your own driving style and put yourself in other people's shoes. If someone banged your back, and it even inconvenienced you a little, you are sure to be a little pissed. If you were banged, and your bumper even a slight hairline crack or reverse sensor sounds different, is it fair to you? Would you go out and get a cheap taiwan bumper and cheapo aftermarket sensor? Or would you rather get original parts to get your car back in original shape (which it was b4 some idiot banged u from behind?)<br><br>It's true some people like to take the opportunity to makan you, that's why you should have a camera/camera phone ready to take shots of the scene.<br><br>Hopefully with more 'authorised' workshops around and IDAC, it will be harder for cheats to fake claims.</div>

With now most insurance require IDAC inspection before claims, the other party also have to send to authorized workshops what repair according to the IDAC report. You bang into the bumper, of course the bumper must change and reverse sensor spolit. Replacing bumper, reverse sensor , add spraying of other affected parts already cost almost 2k !!! Leave the car in the workshop to wait for bumpers and repair take one or 2 days, your fault , so it is fair the other party include rental car for alternative transport ( remember they did not ask you to bang them one , u ownself insist to bang them ).  Then people also have to waste time to fill in reports and send to workshop -say take it 1/2 day of work, you paying for the other poor party 1/2 of wasted time ???<br><br>I just cannot find it how can people be "cunning" !!! when they did not ask you to bang into them in the first place, and it is you who chose to bang into them.<br><br>Think instead sometime, some people just refuse to blame themselves for being "stupid" of banging into others , and would rather think of the other party as "cunning" instead.<br><br></div>

That what they are for, as an independent party to see that no tricks is done. A self inflicted damage all can be tell.</div>
