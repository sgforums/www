The first hour might be $8, but the subsequent hours go for $6/hr, so cheaper is i book for longer hours. They give me 10km free for each hour, so if I book for 6 hours, I get 60Km free - the cost ard $38, everything included (except cashcard and coupons of course). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Owning car is good to an extend for convenience la.. But if you are talking abt price.. Sure loose out to countries like Hong Kong and US la.. But if i never remember wrongly.. Hong Kong.. the price of cars is dirt cheap.. Where the price of a 7 series mercs gets you a Ferrari there..<br><br>But the parking there is hell of an expensive.. Is count by parking lots.. So there are its pros and cons here..<br><br>Anyway, back to topic.. Car sharing has a minimum age of 23 to rent the car. If you are a P plate holder, you will need to put a deposit.. (P plate after 23 I mean)..<br><br>It is only good for those who requires the use of cars urgently for a particular event or activity.. Than it will be worth it.. but if you are talking about long term usuage.. Doing the proper calculations.. I think the cost will be higher than the normal monthly payment of a car.</div>

Guhment cannot control how rich the people want to get (the richer the better what) thus guhment have to think of creative ways to curb the jams (which I think are doing quite well now). At least it really helps drivers who REALLY needs to get around in their vehicles.</div>

Else I take MRT cos it's near my place. Everytime I use is around 3 -6 hours. The first hour might be $8, but the subsequent hours go for $6/hr, so cheaper is i book for longer hours. They give me 10km free for each hour, so if I book for 6 hours, I get 60Km free - the cost ard $38, everything included (except cashcard and coupons of course). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>If you were to rent a car every weekend, you may find a OPC much more cheaper in the long run.<br><br></div>
