            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Redz,<br><br>I usually start off my journey in a fair mood, often good. But by the time I reached my destination, I will have already lost half if not all my good or fair mood.<br><br>Tailgaters are a daily experience. People who cut into my lane narrowly missing my front bumper comes second, and motorists who either don't know how to merge with traffic in an expressway or have no patient to give way by pacing their merge is another.<br><br>And then, there are those dreaded roundabouts or circles. The one at Newton is the worst, and the other at Tuas is even worst. I think generally, a lot of motorists DON'T know how to use a circle. Signalling is crucial when using a circle or roundabout, so that others may know your intended exit from the circle/roundabout. Some even cut out from the inner lane of a circle, passing across two lanes just to exit into a road branch! It's mayhem, and downright hazardous!!<br><br>Carparks: people don't know that it is a good idea to hit the hazard light button when they find a lot and wants to park. They often just stop and those behind will have to stomp on their brakes, and often need to back up because the car in front starts to reverse without any signals at all.<br><br>I think Singaporeans drive the way they walk in general. Total lack of conideration.<br><br></div></blockquote>We're certainly on the same road  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Dun think I've ever sworn as much b4 I bot my car.  I believe alot of such unpleasant situations can be avoided if each of us were to exercise a little more care and patience when driving.<br><br>Still tink a safe and pleasant drive shd be a norm rather than a myth...all it takes is pure common sense on the road... ok, experience do play a part in situations like merging at highways or filtering at circles - blame the GOVT for not including them in road tests  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Sometimes I wonder if people do those acts without knowing tat they're being inconsiderate to others?!  Or perhaps they've assume too much abt their rites on roads.<br><br>Certain blood-stirring situations I encounter almost daily shd ring a bell to u guys:-<br><br>(1)  Once they signalled, they assume/expect u to let them in almost immediately!<br><br>(2)  Having ducked out fm the side-road, they wld suddenly be in no hurry to pick up speed.<br><br>(3)  In view of a red light some distance ahead, they wld inevitably crawl towards the light oblivious of others behind.<br><br>....surely u guys wld've many more like encounters.  Perhaps we can list them here and let everyone knows tat they are "inconsiderate" acts... juz in case some are genuinely not aware  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Hopefully with such awareness, we can all attempt to minimize their occurences and enjoy of road-jorneys more often!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
