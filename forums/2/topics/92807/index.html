            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Redz,<br><br>I usually start off my journey in a fair mood, often good. But by the time I reached my destination, I will have already lost half if not all my good or fair mood.<br><br>Tailgaters are a daily experience. People who cut into my lane narrowly missing my front bumper comes second, and motorists who either don't know how to merge with traffic in an expressway or have no patient to give way by pacing their merge is another.<br><br>And then, there are those dreaded roundabouts or circles. The one at Newton is the worst, and the other at Tuas is even worst. I think generally, a lot of motorists DON'T know how to use a circle. Signalling is crucial when using a circle or roundabout, so that others may know your intended exit from the circle/roundabout. Some even cut out from the inner lane of a circle, passing across two lanes just to exit into a road branch! It's mayhem, and downright hazardous!!<br><br>Carparks: people don't know that it is a good idea to hit the hazard light button when they find a lot and wants to park. They often just stop and those behind will have to stomp on their brakes, and often need to back up because the car in front starts to reverse without any signals at all.<br><br>I think Singaporeans drive the way they walk in general. Total lack of conideration.<br><br></div>
