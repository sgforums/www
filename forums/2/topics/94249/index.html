            <div class='col-md body'>Sighs such a big headache I have here...<br><br>Also don't know who can help me on this. So though of sharing with you guys here and see what kind of advices I can get.<br><br>Just got my car a month back.. the Altis from Borneo Motors.<br>And because Borneo Motors endorses Huper Optik solar flim, my SE intro it to me and reccomend to go install it.<br><br>All's well..so the day I collect my car... check to see if any defect... no defects..great..sign form...and very same day drove to Huper Optik to fix the solar flim.<br><br>The procedeure of Huper Optik's installation is.. they would first check the whole car for any defects..or scratches just in case customer dispute... and once all this is checked.. they begin their work.<br><br>For those that don't know how they install the flims:<br>They spray some liquid on the outside of the windows/glass and paste their flim over it so they can cut the proper size and shape for them to ultimatly paste the flim at the inner side of the windows.<br><br>Thats where the problem arises... when they'r almost done with the installing of the flim and cleaning up my car.. they notice on the top right outer side of my windscreen some liquid seep in between... basically a defective windscreen which water actually could seep in between the glass...which for my case..the liquid from the huper optik installation.<br><br>The man told us this case.. is not their fault.. and neither it is our fault.. it's Borneo Motor's fault for this manufactuer defect.. and because the car is under warranty.. we went back during the servicing to ask BM to change our windscreen which they agree....<br><br>BUT changing the windscreen means we'll need to get a new huper optik flim which cost about $300 just for the windscreen portion... and Borneo Motor is not going to pay for the replacement flim as they only cover the windscreen itself..and not the flim.<br><br>Huper optik definetly won't pay because it isn't their fault...<br><br>I call my SE.. and he couldn't provide me with a satisfactory answer..<br><br>I am stuck in between..<br><br>ARGH..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose the extra solar film was given to you out of the SE's quota of free gifts/commission. So it may not make business sense for him/her to pay the damage for you. The deal was already closed.<br><br>Since you got a replacement of the windscreen, I think you should also check all glass panels as well and make real sure that all are waterproof.<br><br>As for the compensation, your case is only valid if the situation is stated in the contract. However, it is likely that the contract says "we are not responsible for damages caused by a third party".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think it's really absurd if you're expected to fork out the extra costs yourself when no damaging causes can be pointed at u... i know nuts abt legal terms, but i strongly believe that as a consumer, if you're entitled to the package in the contract, including complimentary items, then the seller has the utmost responsibility to fulfill that by hook or by crook at no expense of the consumer. fight your case man...<br><br>as what D16Z6 says, seek address from the higher authorities. i reckon the reputation is of their concern. blow things up if you can haha...</div>
