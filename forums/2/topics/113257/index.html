            <div class='col-md body'>ya, omv: open market value, the value you sell your car in the open market. The more the value, the more you get back when you scrap your car. But you probably paid less for your Wish than your friend, so more or less back to square one. Might be better to use depreciation as a guide  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If your friend's OMV is higher, it could also mean that his car has more gadgets than yours. From what I know, even an additional sunroof demands a higher OMV.<br>I may be wrong....<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Johnathan:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi guys, I just bought a new Toyota Wish from AML.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, the omv is the Open Market Value, which i believe is the price importers pay the exporters for the vehicle. But the weird thing is that for the same model, both Toyota Wish 1.8XE, with the same accessories has a difference of about $4000+ in value.<br><br>I'm pretty sure its not differences in accessories, the model code is the same (base model), without sunroof. More likely that LTA reduced taxes. I paid $84,800 for the car. My friend paid like $88,000, but that was like 3 months ago.<br><br>Getting bothered cause $4000 in OMV = over $7000 reduction in taxes... I kinda think that i was overcharged for the car.<br><br>Experts, any Toyota Wish owners over here? What's your OMV if you got your car recently, like this year. Its the 1.8L XE base model.</div>

Not to forget currency exchange rate will affect OMV and recently Sing dollar has strengthened over Yen. So u pay less for more or less the same thing in Jap.</div>
