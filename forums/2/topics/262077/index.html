            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Laguna coupe on the way</strong></span><br><br>Renault is putting the final touches to a new Laguna coupe. The new two-door is part of a plan to increase sales as well as boosting Renault's brand image and profitability.<br><br>The new two-door will go on sale in the second half of 2008, about 12 months behind the new Laguna hatchback and estate.<br><br>The coupÃ©Â’s look is distinct from its sister cars and has been heavily influenced by the 2004 Fluence concept.<br><br>A Renault source told Autocar that the coupÃ© will be Â“less conservativeÂ” than the five-door Laguna. It is expected to be a two-door notchback design.<br><br>Like the new Laguna hatch, the coupÃ© will be 4.7m long and will be capable of accommodating four adults in comfort. It will also have the same interior fittings, which is no bad thing, as the new dashboard and associated switchgear are notable for their design quality.<br><br>The Fluence concept was powered by the 3.5-litre V6 from NissanÂ’s 350Z, and itÂ’s expected that a Nissan-derived V6 will find its way into the production version. Less expensive versions will get a turbocharged 170bhp four-cylinder petrol engine and a powerful four-cylinder turbodiesel. Both six-speed manual and six-speed automatic transmissions will be offered.<br><br>Renault says the new Laguna chassis has been substantially reworked to improve the precision of the steering and reduce body roll. The dampers have been stiffened by 50 per cent at the rear and 20 per cent at the front and thereÂ’s also a new rear anti-roll bar. Even so, Renault claims to have retained Â“outstanding ride qualityÂ”.<br><br>Top-end models will get electronically controlled rear-wheel steering. Although still rare on a production car, these systems can dramatically improve the agility and turn-in prowess of a front-wheel-drive car.<br><br>The LagunaÂ’s safety systems have been upgraded, with the side impact protection being modified to trigger earlier in a collision.<br><img src="http://i192.photobucket.com/albums/z116/EnzoFerrari90/1867733130.jpg"></div>

Company boss Carlos Ghosn is known to have curtailed the flamboyance of design director Patrick le Quement in an attempt to make the firmÂ’s styling less divisive.<br><br>Underneath is Renault-NissanÂ’s Alliance C platform, also shared with the new X-Trail and the Qashqai. That means a suspension set-up consisting of MacPherson struts up front and a four-link rear end.<br><br>Like the X-Trail, the Koleos will have hill descent control and hill start assist, with part-time four-wheel drive. A mechanical coupling engages four-wheel drive and acts like a centre diff lock.<br><br>Engines will include the Renault-developed 2.0-litre common rail diesel with 147bhp or 170bhp, coupled to a six-speed gearbox, and a 136bhp 2.0-litre petrol.<br><br></div>

Power outputs have also increased.<br><br>Now that cars have beneficial safety features Â– airbags, pedestrian impact zones and the like Â– they are by necessity heavier than before. But what this has to do with top speeds, we're not sure, other than the fact that it takes greater effort to start and stop a heavier car than a lighter one.<br><br>But it's not just power and weight that have increased Â– car's braking systems and tyres have also improved (not least because EU legislation means that anti-lock brakes are now mandatory on new cars).<br><br>We're all for increased safety Â– such as the proposed standard fitment of ESP stability control Â– but to claim that banning the making of cars capable of over 101mph would create a dramatic reduction of CO2 is incorrect.<br><br>We can't help but think that, say, Mr Davies not flying from his Stockport base to Brussels every week would help a bit more.<br><br>Oh yes, and Mr Davies was also a big supporter of GM's decision to build the new Vauxhall Astra at Ellesmere Port in April.<br><br>"This is a fantastic reward for the commitment shown by everyone involved to keeping car manufacturing alive in Ellesmere Port," said Davies.<br><br>Quite right, but seeing as every single model in the current Astra range is capable of well over 101mph, if Mr Davies' proposal succeeds at the EU, there will be no new Astra.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ford selling its PAG division? What say you?<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AB Volvo to buy back Volvo?</span></strong><br><br>Just as the sale of Chrysler to Cerberus cleared a major hurdle yesterday, Ford has come to occupy the automotive soap opera stage with the sale of its PAG brands including Volvo, Land Rover and Jaguar. According to Swedish news reports, the newest dark horse candidate interested in the Premiere Automotive Group is AB Volvo, the Swedish commercial truck manufacturer that sold its stake in Volvo to Ford almost ten years ago. AB Volvo is reportedly only interested in buying back Volvo, not in purchasing PAG as a whole. Analysts are crying foul, though, citing the fact there's little logic in AB Volvo buying back what it sold to Ford almost a decade ago after having worked so hard to build up its commercial truck business. What's particularly interesting is that Renault happened to acquire a little over 20% of AB Volvo in a past deal that sent the French manufacturer's truck unit to Sweden. Speculation has also recently made Renault a potential suitor for Ford's PAG brands, which means a potential alliance between AB Volvo and Renault could have some serious purchasing power.-autoblog</div>

What say you?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AB Volvo to buy back Volvo?</span></strong><br><br>Just as the sale of Chrysler to Cerberus cleared a major hurdle yesterday, Ford has come to occupy the automotive soap opera stage with the sale of its PAG brands including Volvo, Land Rover and Jaguar. According to Swedish news reports, the newest dark horse candidate interested in the Premiere Automotive Group is AB Volvo, the Swedish commercial truck manufacturer that sold its stake in Volvo to Ford almost ten years ago. AB Volvo is reportedly only interested in buying back Volvo, not in purchasing PAG as a whole. Analysts are crying foul, though, citing the fact there's little logic in AB Volvo buying back what it sold to Ford almost a decade ago after having worked so hard to build up its commercial truck business. What's particularly interesting is that Renault happened to acquire a little over 20% of AB Volvo in a past deal that sent the French manufacturer's truck unit to Sweden. Speculation has also recently made Renault a potential suitor for Ford's PAG brands, which means a potential alliance between AB Volvo and Renault could have some serious purchasing power.-autoblog[/b]</blockquote><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Renault, AB Volvo eyeing Ford's Volvo Cars, newspaper says</span></strong><br>Renault and Swedish truck maker AB Volvo are interested in buying automaker Volvo Cars from Ford, business daily Dagens Industri reported, citing undisclosed sources.<br><br>World number two truck maker AB Volvo, which sold its autos unit to Ford almost a decade ago, would be likely to take a minority stake in Volvo Cars of around 10-20 percent, the newspaper reported.<br><br>Analysts were doubtful, saying such a move made little industrial sense for AB Volvo.<br><br>"This looks like a bad solution for Volvo's shareholders as there is no real industrial logic in buying a stake (in Volvo Cars) ... I think it would be very strange if they would take such a step", Danske Equities analyst Henrik Breum said.<br><br>Following the divestment of its auto unit in 1999, AB Volvo has mainly focused on strengthening its position in heavy-duty trucks and construction equipment, notably through the acquisition of truck makers Mack and Renault Trucks.<br><br>The acquisition of Mack and Renault Trucks from the Renault group left the French automaker with a stake of just over 20 percent in AB Volvo.<br><br>The Gothenburg-based truck maker, which also manufactures buses, engines, construction equipment and aircraft components, has not publicly voiced any interest in returning to the auto business in recent years.<br><br>AB Volvo spokesman Marten Wikforss would not comment on the report, saying the firm never responded to rumors. Asked if the firm had any interest in acquiring an automaker, he said: "You can just look at our current structure."<br><br>Volvo Cars spokeswoman Maria Bohlin was equally tight-lipped when asked to comment on the article.<br><br>"We aren't saying anything since we won't comment on speculations in the media," she said.<br><br>The truck maker has routinely stated that it is interested in strengthening all parts of its existing business, not least its truck operations outside Europe and North America where acquisitions would be difficult for competition reasons.<br><br>This year, the firm bought Japan's Nissan Diesel in a $1.1 billion deal, more than doubling its sales in Asia.<br><br>It is also in talks on a possible investment in a vehicle joint venture, Dongfeng Motor, owned by former Nissan Diesel parent Nissan Motor and China's Dongfeng Motor.<br></div>

"It can't be all of the stake."<br><br>Volkswagen wanted a "substantial" stake in Proton, Najib said, adding that the German firm possibly wanted a stake in the manufacturing division.<br><br>"If we want a foreign strategic partner then we have to accept the fact that it has to be run on a commercial basis," he said.<br><br>Volkswagen and loss-making Proton have been in extended talks for a tie-up aimed at helping the Malaysian company boost its sales and turn itself around.<br><br>Najib also said the government would keep petrol prices unchanged for the rest of the year and that the economy was expected to expand six percent in 2008.<br><br>"It's good macroeconomic management to cut back fuel subsidies. But it will come at a political cost," he said.<br><br>"I think in the long term we should try to reduce the subsidy, but it has to be a gradual process. We'd like to maintain petrol prices at the present level, at least for the rest of this year."<br><br>Malaysia last raised fuel prices by about a fifth in February 2006, setting off a round of price increases which drove inflation to a seven-year high of 4.8 percent in March last year, prompting the central bank to raise interest rates.<br><br>Inflation has since eased to 1.5 percent in April.<br><br>Najib said there should be enough momentum in the economy to repeat this year's projected growth of 6 percent in 2008.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Ferrari of the future</span></strong><br>On the eve of its 60th anniversary celebrations, Ferrari has given us a glimpse of its future at a special technology conference held at Fiorano.<br><br>We're not about to get electric Ferraris, but regenerative braking, advanced turbocharged engines, massive weight reductions and biofuels are all on the cards for the famous Italian brand.<br><br>"The world is changing, and Ferrari is changing too," said a spokesman. The aim is to lose no performance, but to make lighter, more efficient cars.<br><br>Ferrari displayed its planned technological advances in a special 1000kg Enzo-based car called the FXX Millechili. It's 365kg lighter than the production car. Ferrari says its plan is to reduce the weight of every car it makes by around 300kg over their predecessors.<br><br>Ferrari reckons that had the Enzo weighed 1000kg its 650bhp would have been as effective as 800bhp.<br><br>Lighter cars will require less power, and also therefore smaller brakes and lighter suspension components. Handling is also likely to be improved.<br><br>The 599 GTB, says Ferrari, is the last car it will build using "late 1990s technology" in the shape of a chassis that's a mix of extruded and bonded aluminium. Future cars will have a monocoque chassis, in what was dubbed "a major rethink" of the way Ferraris are built.<br><br>Engines will be downsized, with smaller capacities, direct injection and turbochargers all playing a part. Future Ferraris will also have the ability to run on E80 bioethanol fuel. The plan is to reduce average CO2 emissions across the range from 400g/km to 250.<br><br>Transmissions will be smaller and lighter, not least because they will not need to cope with quite as much power.<br><br>Ferrari also wants to harness regenerative braking power; but unlike in current cars this won't be used to charge the batteries or work in place of the alternator. Instead, it would power a small motor attached to the transmission, with the aim of keeping it spinning, enabling smoother gearchanges.<br><br>Aerodynamics will also move on. Ferrari is currently working with Imperial College London on an advanced active aerodynamics system that involves using air pumps to push air over and under the car. This smoothes airflow and cuts drag.<br><br>All of these changes are expected to happen over the next decade, so expect the Ferrari of 2017 to be a very different beast to today's machines.<br><br>Finally, Ferrari hinted that a replacement for what it dubbed "the collector's car", the Enzo, would be brought to market in 2010. Expect it to be lighter, faster and even more dramatic.<br><br>After 60 years, it seems that Ferrari is following the advice of Lotus founder Colin Chapman, and adding lightness wherever it can.<br><br></div>
