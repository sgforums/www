Three of LexusÂ’ main model lines include hybrid derivatives. Those cars account for more than 70 percent of the brandÂ’s sales in the UK, LexusÂ’ biggest market in Europe.<br><br>The IS is offered with gasoline and diesel powertrains.<br><br>Settle was unable to confirm the name of the new hybrid or whether it was derived from an existing platform. He said the new Lexus hybrid will be sold in Japan and Europe, but he was not certain about a launch in North America.<br></div>

The 307 was PeugeotÂ’s top-selling vehicle last year with 306,704 units Â– but that was down 18.4 percent from sales in 2005. It ranked fourth in the lower-medium segment last year, behind the Golf, Astra and Focus.<br><br>Peugeot aims to sell 350,000 units of the 308, a company spokesperson said. The highest annual sale for the 307 was 350,000 units.<br><br>The new model will cost the same as the 307, which starts at about 18,000 euros in France.<br><br>The 308 is set to be the first vehicle to use PeugeotÂ’s diesel hybrid powertrain. That version is expected to be launched later in 2008.<br><br>The IAA in Frankfurt in early September will be the first public showing of the 308. At launch, the car will be available in three-door and five-door variations. But other body styles, including a station wagon, convertible and compact minivan, are expected to follow over the next couple of years. The Peugeot 308 shares a platform with the Citroen C4.<br><br>Peugeot said the 308 will be offered with three gasoline engine choices and two diesel engine choices Â– all with four cylinders. The gasoline engines range from a 1.4-liter unit rated at 95 hp to a 1.6-liter unit rated at 150 hp. Diesel choices are either a 1.6-liter or 2.0-liter unit. Horsepower ratings range from 90 to 136, depending on transmission choice.<br><br>The styling of the 308 gives the car a low drag coefficient of 0.29, Peugeot said. It said the car, equipped with a 90-hp diesel engine, would emit only 120 grams of CO2 per kilometer, meeting a new standard set by the European Commission for 2012.<br><br>Options on the 308 will include rear door side impact airbags, lane departure warning system and active bi-xenon headlamps.<br><br>The 308 is slightly longer and wider than its predecessor, but also slightly lower. The wheelbase is unchanged from the 307.<br></div>

The first prototypes already on test in the UK, and our exclusive artistÂ’s impression reveals, for the first time, how the car could look.<br><br>For McLaren the project will be a chance to build a pure-bred follow-up the legendary F1, a car still regarded by some as the finest high-performance car in history.<br><br>F2: aborted Mercedes project comes good<br><br>The F2 has its roots in the P8, the car McLaren had been committed to building as a smaller and cheaper supercar with Mercedes, after the launch of the SLR. Mercedes boss Jurgen Hubbert confirmed in early 2004 that the company was actively Â“looking at a mid-engined road carÂ”.<br><br>Codenamed P8, the car was put on hold in late 2004 by then-Mercedes Car Group boss Eckhard Cordes. Cordes said that the P8 had Â“successfully completed the concept stage,Â” but development had been frozen.<br><br>The hiatus was mainly a result of huge losses at Mercedes and the emergence of significant quality problems in its mainstream models. Also, the SLR was also not as well received as Mercedes had hoped and there was a great deal of recrimination in the air, especially about its perceived engineering failings.<br><br>McLaren goes it alone<br><br>The F2 will be a solo effort by the Woking outfit, and a chance to re-establish the companyÂ’s credentials at the top-end of the market.<br><br>Sources have told Autocar that mechanical mules disguised under a Ferrari 360 body are already running around the companyÂ’s Woking HQ. They advise to expect a mid-engined machine built around a carbon-fibre monocoque.<br><br>If the new car does echo the 15-year old F1 concept it will be powered by a normally aspirated V12 powerplant too. However, as F1 currently demands V8 engines, the baby McLaren could reflect F1Â’s attempts to become greener by concentrating on keeping weight down in tandem with a more modest powerplant.<br><br></div>

On its 50th birthday the Cinquecento is back, and Fiat says it will become the iPod of cars.<br><br>Fiat is launching a new version of the three-door Cinquecento -- which means "500" in Italian -- at a ceremony in its hometown of Turin today, with the car making its comeback after going out of production in the 1970s.<br><br>Fiat's CEO Sergio Marchionne says he wants to emulate Apple by making its cars as stylish as the U.S. company's computers and electronic gadgets, including the mass-selling iPod portable music player.<br><br>"I want Fiat to become the Apple of cars," Marchionne told La Stampa newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday.<br><br>"And the Cinquecento will be our iPod," he said, referring to Apple's hugely successful iPod.<br><br>Like the Mini or the Volkswagen Beetle, the Cinquecento is an icon. For Italians, it epitomises the economic boom that their country enjoyed after the WWII.<br><br>Cheap and efficient, it gradually replaced the scooter for millions of people whose living standards improved dramatically during the 1950s and 1960s.<br><br>After 18 years on the road the Cinquecento went out of production in 1975.<br><br>Marchionne said he was working to make Fiat a nimble automaker after a successful restructuring.<br><br>It took Fiat 18 months to bring the new 500 to market.<br><br>"It's twice the time for a child to be born but half of what our competitors need (to make their own cars)," Marchionne said.<br><br>Faithful to the spirit of the original, the Cinquecento will sell as a mass-market, rather than a premium, car.<br><br>Italian newspapers say the car will be priced at about 10,000 euros ($13,600).<br><br>Its production target will also be small: an annual 120,000 units against a total Fiat output of about 2 million units.<br><br>And it faces competition from cars such as Renault's revamped Twingo.<br><br>Analysts expect the new 500 to help Fiat's image rather than its bottom line even though it will be built at a Polish plant to keep costs down.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pagani Zonda R is go!</strong></span><br>750bhp track car set for production; 'C9' introduction delayed<br><img src="http://i192.photobucket.com/albums/z116/EnzoFerrari90/car_photo_219718_5.jpg"><br>With six deposits received already and a further four awaiting final confirmation, Pagani has confirmed that its wild, track-only Zonda R will go into production. Just ten examples of this 1.2million euro, 750bhp FXX-rival will be built, with delivery of the first car scheduled for March 2008.<br><br>This latest announcement is an indication of the dramatic rise in interest that Pagani is enjoying at the moment. Company founder Horacio Pagani recently claimed that if he were to build 100 Zonda F coupes (rather than limiting the run to just 25) he could sell them all.<br><br>This pent-up demand is now reflected in the values of existing cars, according to Horacio, with good used examples of the C12 and C12S now fetching around 400,000 euros (a C12 was 250,000 euros new) and coupe Fs changing hands for 150,000-200,000 euros above list.<br><br>The biggest problem for Pagani has always been its inability to meet the demand for its cars, mainly because the current factory simply doesnÂ’t have the capacity to build them fast enough. But help is just around the corner, as Pagani has recently managed to secure a new complex within a kilometre of its existing unit.<br><br>Three times bigger than the current facility, this will enable production to increase dramatically, from the current 16 cars a year to around 60 once the ZondaÂ’s replacement, known internally as the C9, comes on stream. However, the introduction of that car has been put back a year, to 2009, due to the Zonda R getting the go ahead.<br><br>Even when the C9 does arrive, though, donÂ’t expect to see a flood of Paganis coming to the UK. Unlike the Zonda, the C9 will be homologated for sale in all key markets, including, for the first time, the USA and Japan, and 50 per cent of the additional output is expected to go to these new territories.<br><br>PaganiÂ’s new factory will also allow the company to increase its maintenance activities, something which Horacio deems essential for the future value of his creations now that there are so many out there (82 Zondas have been built to date).<br><br>Horacio has also been busy with a number of other design projects recently, including a watch, a radical hi-fi system (due to be launched in September) and a boat along the lines of a Wally Tender. All these new products will be enthused with HoracioÂ’s unique take on combining art with engineering, just as weÂ’ve seen with his cars.<br><br></div>

In the transmission, the odd-numbered gears are fixed to one input shaft, and the even-numbers gears are fixed to a second shaft. Electronics activate the clutches for gear shifts, either automatically or at the driverÂ’s command.<br><br>The advantage of the dual-clutch transmission is the better fuel economy of a traditional manual transmission without the need for the driver to step on a clutch pedal.<br><br>The Mitsubishi transmission works similarly to other dual-clutch transmissions, such as the Direct Shift Gearbox transmission used by Volkswagen. BorgWarner supplies the VW unit. BWM is also using automated manual transmission technology, and Ford Motor is working on a similar technology.<br><br>The Mitsubishi transmission will be equipped with three shift modes -- normal, sport and s-sport. The sport and s-sport modes hold each gear longer for higher engine rpms, and also change gears faster.<br><br>Mitsubishi did not name the supplier of the transmission.<br><br>Sure-footed chassis<br><br>The all-wheel-drive system of the current Lancer Evolution uses anti-lock brakes, an active center differential and a yaw control for high performance. For the next generation, Mitsubishi will introduce stability control.<br><br>The stability control uses sensors in the steering wheel and the wheels to compare the driverÂ’s intended path with the carÂ’s actual path. If the car is headed for an understeer or oversteer condition, the system applies brake pressure at one or two wheels to correct the carÂ’s path.<br><br>Mitsubishi will market the system as Super All Wheel Control.<br><br></div>
