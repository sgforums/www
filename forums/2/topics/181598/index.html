            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. may be a bad news to some as some are still waiting for it to drop before buying their love car.. but it s also goodnews for those who had bought or just bought your ride.<br><br>Government had lessen 10000+ COEs per annual.. do you guys think that COE will shoot up further?<br><br>Just check with my SE.. Mit. Lancer had gone up by 1.5k already.. and with the rise of COEs.. will affording a car be tedious again? Although govt says will the price will stay within 3%.. but hey 3% is a lot of money! you can use that 3% to pay the interest.<br><br>Is it the right time for ppl who are still waiting to buy or continue waiting?<br><br>WAIT? / BUY?<br><br>DROP? / RISE?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dude, it's a cycle... now COE rise, all the car companies raise their car prices by $2k. So that in the next bidding, they will all bid $2k higher for their COEs, so the next COE will be another $2k higher than the current one. The car companies will respond to that by raising the price a further $2k more, and COE will rise by another $2k in the next next bidding... and so on.<br><br>That's why as i've always said, COE is on the upwards trend now, want to buy better buy now cos the only way is UP.<br><br>And it is not true that people who want to buy new car will already have bought. There are MANY MANY MANY still out there considering whether to buy/change car, and many first time buyers too. The demand will NEVER end...<br><br>I predict the COE will hit 20k by mid year.. maybe even earlier.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
