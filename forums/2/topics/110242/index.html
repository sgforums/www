            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br><br>u mean the normal YRV n not the turbo 1 rite?i dun think the 0-100km/h is better than vois,as vios is doing 9.8 sec.Unless u r talking abt the turbo version.<br><br>U shld give yrself more time to consider,so i think u shld go n test drive all n decide which is better. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah I agree. Anyway the 0-100 speed doesnt matter since we are not racing, I test driven the YRV and pickup is efficient and fast. Although vios is really very common, it cannot be deny the fact its still an excellent car with good fc and no major problems. However the more panaromic view of YRV is attractive and also the SE is throwing in Vkool, reverse sensor and alarm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although the YRV is smaller especially on the engine bay but YRV has been going to crash test and it passed like a sedan that is same as a VIOS. The occupant zone was safe on the industry standard crash speed.<br><br>Vios have booth where u can do shopping. Put things in.<br><br>But the FC is pooer than Vios which manual can get average 14 to 16km/l. The size and price only a bit different. If you are opting the YRV turbo then it would be great compare to vios as it have the raw power. That feeling is good and not necessary mean u gotta be speeding.<br><br>There was a time when EVO rulez.... everywhere u can see Evo or Lancer.<br>When Sunny just introduce the lastest model everyone was also rushing to get it.<br>When Civic with big small eyes lamp and VTEC..... everywhere u see Vtec....<br>So now we have got a good pricing Vios with all those goodies that is why u see Vios everywhere.<br><br>Further when that model is more.... the spare parts and the cost to maintain is lower. You are not isolated. If you are buying a unique cars/few cars on the road like Ferrari that would be good as its a sport class automobile. But you are getting a saloon and easier and lower cost to maintain is the key point.<br><br>Do u feel sick when u see those Lancer, Sunny, Civic and Corolla few years back at everywhere? Have u ever thought like owning one of them?<br>There maybe lots of same model around but each and every is different especially in the eyes of its owner, right?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree but the reason I rejected VIOS is not entirely bcoz of commonity, but more bcoz YRV provides a higher view which I feel in terms of comfort and safety, is better than sedan. As more boot space, bcoz I rear a dog, so for hatchback I can down all the seats at the back and let them roam around at the back which I cant do for sedan. Anyway appreciate your comments, truly logical about sporean buying trend, go for the commonest as its the safest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have test driven the Vios and YRV. The VIOS engine is more refined whereas the YRV's a bit louder giving me the impression that its rough. Anyway, Daihaitsu is also part of Toyota as can be seen in many of its components in the car. Handling wise, because of the ride height, YRV has a bit more roll. So in the handling department, YRV is out. Interior, YRV's does not make that much sound compared to VIOS. The latter's interior is simple cannot make it and will not last.
