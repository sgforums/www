Can be faster than most at the red light. I also just started diving manual after 4 years of non-driving. At first, I rev too. Then later when I saw how my bro handle my car, I tried to shift at lower rpm. But like most un-experience divers, you will experience engine coughing.<br><br>This is my usual pick up routine now. 1st to 2nd, 2.0-2.5k rpm. 2nd to 3rd, ~3k rpm. 3rd to 4th, ~2.8k rpm. 4th to 5th, ~2.5krpm. Usually if I am the first car at the traffic light, I will be able to shift into 3rd gear before I exit the junction. Once cross, I would be in the 4th.<br><br>I guess it is about the speed you shift your gear. Try to create a high enough acceleration so that when you clutch out (free gear), there is enough momentum to roll the car without losing much speed. And of course, don't take forever to upshift. When reach crusing speed, always use 5th gear even when you are only travelling at 60kph. Down-shift when there is a need to accelerate.<br><br>Keep playing the gears and clutch. I have to, cause kelisa is really weak. Practices makes perfect, engine stall is common for the first few weeks, you will overcome it. Best if you can get someone experience you know who can drives smoothly to have a test drive on your car (the normal way, not reving one). I actually let 4 others drive my car during my "run-in" stage just to check out their driving method and learn from them.</div>

And can beat most ppl at the red lights.<br><br>I guess your problem might be clutch control. Try to find the optimum biting point of your clutch. Most ppl who seldom drive a manual, couldnt catch hold of the point and tend to rav too early or later. For me, I only start raving once i reach the biting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey rumie not an expert but i drive a stick too; normally what i do is to keep my eye on the speedo, not the tacho. and to use the lower gears to accelerate rather than stretch it in 3rd and 4th. i used to have that problem as i shifted up too early, resulting in sluggish moving off. try shifting up from 2nd to 3rd around 35kph, then to 4th at around 45-50. thus the engine should only be spinning around 2.3-2.6k before shifting. should give you a balance between FC and decent speed. don't worry about stalling, just try to rev it a bit more and release the clutch slowly, till the day you instinctively know where the biting point is. might i ask what capacity car are you driving? mine is a 1.6L, so you might need to adapt a bit. but dont try accelerating hard in 5th or 4th, it's slow and it strains the engine.</div>

I think it's more effective to follow the techo.. The speed varies from car to car, and also from terrain to terrain. Different cars can reach different speed at the same gear ravved to the same rpm <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So if possible, follow rpm</div>

I'd say feel your engine, feel where your clutch bites, and where your engine begins to shudder.

            <div class='col-md body'>To save petrol on manual car, shift up at 2k rpm and below. You will move like a tortise but save a lot of petrol. Keep your revs as low as possible. Never exceed 60km/h in top gear. When you see a red light in the distance, about 500km away, put to neutral and let the car coast to the red light. When going downhill, put to neutral and let gravity pull your car. Try it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the ideal rpm to change your gear is when you feel the least jerking motion if not no jerking motion when you release your clutch.  that's what i read lah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun worry... it will come naturally to u after a few months... trust me... den u can fully harness the power of the car... tips wise... I always rev slightly above 2k b4 changing gears when the engine is sufficiently warmed up... if not, I keep my revs to very low, ard 1.5 to 1.8k b4 switching gears.. every car is different... so do take time experimenting yr car.<br><br>On the point of using neutral gear to coast in... experts point out that this might lead to more fuel wastage since the fuel cut off does not kick in if the gear is not engaged.  I am from the opposite camp though... as I feel that fc is definitely improved if u coast in neutral aka "freewheeling".  This is cuz the rolling resistance from the car is significantly lower when in neutral gear aka "no engine brake". Thus the car can cruise further. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Evidence?? I happen to know a Toyota Corolla driver who is consistently getting 16 to 17 km/l although he is making a lot of short drives. He drives by reving the engine up to a high speed den switching to neutral to cruise. He only applies the gears when necessary. I m not asking u all to try this... cuz  I myself is not comfortable when cruising in neutral. Dun worry, u wun spolit anything in the car. Only problem is safety aspect, since the your wheels might be rotating at different speeds.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
