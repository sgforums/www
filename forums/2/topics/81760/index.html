You've never even really done anything for your parents to deserve a car like that... what's more, you don't even have a license...<br><br>Sure... he can drive the car... any kid with legs long enough can drive a lambo down a straight road... but without a license, and proper instruction, he can't handle it very well... that's y companies like Ferrari actually ask their buyers to go for a familiarisation course before actually driving with Ferrari... cos the handling and even seating position of a Lambo is different from a normal car... and unless you learn how to drive in a Lambo, you can't really handle it at the start.....</div>

It was a surprise gift from his dad and he didn't even ASK for it.<br><br>Thirdly, he CAN drive it. Legally.<br><br>So please use your brains before you start blabbering stuff about others. He doesn't even know you and didn't go out of his way to make you feel inferior to him so what's up with some of you making ridiculous comments like wanting him to crash and shit?</div>
