            <div class='col-md body'>There were many things I learnt:<br><br>In the early years of your loan, most of the money goes towards paying off your interest, just like housing loans. In other words, when you sell off too early, you will realise that a great deal of your principal is still around, to be paid off.<br><br>I took a $38k loan (100%), and after 16 instalments of $587 a month, I still have about $34k. Doesn't take much maths to do the calculations. My Swift with COE expiring Jul 2011 has offers of $24k.<br><br>That was the second thing I learnt - I suspect I paid too high a price for the car. Even assuming I knock off $3k for the dealer's profit, can a COE car depreciate $9k in a year?!?!?!? That was the price I paid for not checking out properly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I paid a fair price for the first car I bought in my life, only to be killed by the second car I bought. Goodness. Let this be a warning to all our friends out there - please be very careful. Buying a car is almost like having a child - you may find yourself stuck with it even if it kills you financially.</div>
