Unless they bid under their company (open cat) else you can see the amount they bidded for you. 4 bids <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> bit of long..<br><br>Normal 1 bit or 2 should get unless the buying price is too low.<br></div>

The only uncertainty is how much was her bid.<br><br>Anyway many people must have walked away disappointed without getting their COEs cos the COE prices shot up by so much.. Singaporeans have an unending appetite for new cars.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

But the terms and conditions will usually favour the Car firm. Usually they will forfeit the deposit if the buyer cancel on his part.<br><br>For Q2. i think logically speaking, the forfeiture of the $500 will deemed as case closed. therefore i do not think that the Sales Exe will pursue further.</div>
