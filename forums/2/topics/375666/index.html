              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the raining morning on or about September 10, 2009 at about 10:00 hour or so, I was driving to work with my wife when this freakish incident happened.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I entered BKE from Bukit Panjang. As I switched from lane 3 to lane 2, a piece of light blue metal squeezed itself between my vehicle and a gold-colored Cefiro travelling on lane 1. I released my accelerator and allowed it to overtake me; and what I got was a center finger.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Shortly thereafter, that freak switched to lane 3 and my car came travelling side-by-side with his piece of light blue metal. Wow! That freak was somehow emboldened and repeatedly pointed his center finger at us. He even wound down his window and stretched out his right hand to ensure we see his gesture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I was aroused, honestly, even though I am not gay. I have not seen anyone with that amount of “testosterone” for many years. By then, we were turning into PIE. I honked him and switched-on my hazard light as I pulled over on the road shoulder. I yearned to see how hard and long his center finger was. Unfortunately and much to my dismay, that freak was perhaps suddenly reminded that the very much needed organ was missing in his crotch. In lieu of pulling over, he recklessly cut across two lanes and scurried off, causing a series of braking and honking from approaching traffic. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am not sure if my encounter with such a pseudo-hermaphrodite and possibly also a sufferer of conversion hysteria behind the wheel of SGMxxxx# is case unique or is these elements common phenomena on the road? I fully understand the importance of self-perception as the desired self intrinsically serves a primary motivating factor to an individual. However, self-efficacy has to be objective otherwise it will only lead to self-discrepancy. If a pseudo-hermaphrodite with testicular feminization syndrome (like the one I encounter) desires the “supermale” chromosome will pathetically only ends up realizing the brutal truth of self-discrimination between actual self and desired self. It would be more self-gratifying if he just keeps his hands and fingers on the wheel. </span></p>

However, I would not accord him Adler’s term of superiority complex, no, not even deprecation complex, because these terms connote a degree of masculinity <em>per se</em> that this pseudo-harmaphrodite  pathetically lacks.

Are you suggesting that I replace those terms with more “affective” definitions, say, “ball-less” or a “pussy” for a pseudo-hermaphrodite suffering from testicular feminization syndrome and “prick-less” or no “LC” for one who does not even have the honor to experience the perceived fear of castration in Freud’s phallic stage because he lacks the primary organ<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/unused/asl.png" alt="asl.png"></span></p>

              <p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My apology, dude, if my language
              causes you any pain as it is never my intention to impress through
              common descriptive terms. Are you suggesting that I replace those
              terms with more “affective” definitions, say, “ball-less” or a
              “pussy” for a pseudo-hermaphrodite suffering from testicular
              feminization syndrome and “prick-less” or no “LC” for one who does
              not even have the honor to experience the perceived fear of
              castration in Freud’s phallic stage because he lacks the primary
              organ<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/unused/asl.png" alt="asl.png"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Whichever way, I
              will equally be “struggling linguistically” to depict my experience
              at the mercy of potential respondents. Hope you will bear with me
              or anyone coming in to speak the same language. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I bet you will be seriously uncomfortable, if I were to say “yes” to you first question. What do you think is the underlying cause to point a center finger repeatedly at someone and thence elude consequences arising thereof?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ha..ha..ha! Is your intention really the expression about the art of fornication by when you happen to say “WTF”? Maybe, I do not know. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Anyway, thanks, friend. It is kind and generous of you to be willing to impart your art of expression. Unfortunately, I regret to say that it just does not suit me. I still prefer to describe someone’s mouth bleeds every 28 days rather than simply calling him “CB” mouth or something to that effect. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If that is struggling linguistically, on, please, let me do so.</span></p>
