A lot of women look average without make-up, so its only natural to 'dress-up'. Similar for cars, not to mention owning one in Singapore is an expensive affair.<br><br>People like to accessorize.. their mobile phones, house, cars, even their own body. As mentioned, it's natural to accessorize one's car from a sportier model from the same brand.<br><br>OEM fit, finish and quality are some reasons other than pure ostentation value.<br><br>Of course, the limit for me when you actually TELL people you are driving STi/M5 when in reality it is a TS/Rex or normal 5 series.<br><br>On the same note, I used to think those single exhaust pipe cars who put a fake twin exhaust were just a bunch of poseurs wasting time. But come to think of it, sometimes it does make the car look sporty. It's just a harmless dress-up.<br><br>The problem is that among the genuine enthusiasts, there are also a lot of clueless types who think putting a bit of accessories from a higher-end model on their car makes them on an equal level in some way. They talk it, walk it and drive it like champions, incurring the displeasure of the car community.<br><br>Oh well, maybe if the race track finally does open in Singapore, we'll have a place to legally duke out all differences with a true test of skill!<br><br></div>

IMO, they are still driving the same vehicles which the WRC requires as part of its rules and regulations, as production vehicles homologated for road use. there is absolutely no basis for ur comparison for those cars which are based on a completely different drivetrain/chassis/engine configuration such as TSes or ur run of the mill lancers.<br><br>that said, i should qualify that i am not a hater. yes, everyone is entitled to personalizing that little extension of themselves. but if doing so requires a car to lose its identity altogether to look like something which it is not, then its just plain tastelessness in the name of individuality.</div>
