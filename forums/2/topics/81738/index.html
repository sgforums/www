But the intensivity of vibration depend also very much on the type of engine. For example 2 same 1L cars, one have a double overhead cam with 4 cylinders and 16 valves will be smoother and vibrate lesser than a single ovehead cam with 4 cylinders 12 valves engine. But if the single overhead cam 4 cylinders 12 valves engine compare to a double overhead cam 3 cylinders 12 valves engine, it may be vibrate lesser. I know of the kelisa vibrate very badly, cause I have test drive both the manual and auto. For auto kelisa I found even worse at idling.</div>

So whatever tuning you had mentioned there not valid for new age cars!<br><br>Kelisa's fuel controlling is done by ECU. Unless you are talking about enhancement or upgrading to TC/ SC or even NOS, a new ECU (unichip, e-manage and etc) is required to be reprogrammed with new performing datas in order for the car to boost to it's max, then we talk about tuning!</div>

Have not try Picanto yet. Are they the same? Is this normal for small cc cars?</div></blockquote>For small cc cars, it is normal to see the gear stick shaking, especially 3 cylinders concept! Small cc cars also generated higher noise level! This is due to......<br><br>Lets compare with a 1.6 litre car and do take note of their RPMs. For a 1.6L car to achieve 100km/h, their RPM is about 2000. But for a 1L car to achieve that, their RPM is much higher, about 3000. Same goes with those small cc bikes (super noisy) and larger cc bikes (honda CBR, R6 and etc produce solid and smoother sound).....<br><br>So the higher the RPM you go, more noise generated! And engine oil require to change more often, especially for performance cars!<br></div>
