            <div class='col-md body'>i'm of a different society status as you, but i do agree with both sides, ur dad &amp; ur uncle. my dad was pragmatic, he din go beyond 1.6 for the previous rides. hyundai elantra, honda civic. well we're having a camry now for a couple of yrs. to you it's economical, to us it's sorta a luxury already. well why not, since my dad's already half a century old. perhaps this is his last ride before he gets too old to drive? so why not have a glorious end to his driving life?<br><br>my pt is, have a balance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually both are right in their own ways. It really depend on individual's character.<br><br>Your dad is more rational and his view of wasting roughly close to 8K a year on a 7-series or S350 don't seem rational to him. I believe that to him, money can be better spent elsewhere now or in the future (savings).<br><br>Your uncle is obviously a very different character than your dad. He probably has a "We may never see tmr attitude". Although he spent the huge amount of money on his car, if the car is something that he enjoy it then why not?<br><br>It all boils to if your uncle or your dad feels the money is well spent or not. Even if your dad go and buy a merc or bmw tmr, if he don't enjoy it, then what's the point? Might as well drive camry. On the other hand, if you uncle is restraint from buying his jag XK, I think he will feel miserable, which then why not spent the money for something he enjoy.<br><br>Just live life the way you want it as long as you can afford it, it is not that you need to drive the biggest, most expensive car possible, but the satisfaction you get from owning the car you want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It all depends on how you much spare $$ you have. If after buying a S class or 7 series and this wont hurt your pocket and still have tonns of spare cash, go for it. On another hand, if after buying the camry has left with no spare $$, go buy a Altis.<br>Life short, play hard!!
