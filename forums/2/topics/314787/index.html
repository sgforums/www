              <p>From the owner...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmmm, no way i'm going to read thru this and not reply. <br>I'm the white trd sports M owner and i'm proud to drive this car, <br>along with every single one of my brothers and sisters on the road, <br>no matter which variant. <br><br>Anyone who says a celica is not a performance car blindly probably doesn't <br>own half a performance car. Either that or is a big major airhead. <br><br>I won't say it's a high performance car but it's definitely a performance car. <br>With it's relatively light weight and aerodynamic body, it will go high performance, <br>it just depends on how much $$$ u want to spend. There are celicas overseas <br>esp in japan and the USA winning competitions built on the vvtiL toyota engine. <br><br>Anyone still insisting on it being not even a performance car better have an NA car that will do 6 secs 0-100 in the 2L category, cause that's what i'm doing. <br><br>And if you can beat that i can find faster celicas on the local roads for you.. <br><br>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Actually if you read thru the whole thread at mycarforum, you will notice it's not really the celicasg people's fault.. if people keep on saying your car is a poser car, of course u will feel unhappy also, and if you dont retaliate then its equivalent to saying that you admit your car is also a poser car..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in the first place, no one ever said celica was a high performance car, is the TS lack of knowledge end up saying things that really piss the celicasg people off..</p>

              <p><br>End of the day, your M3, BMW M3 or Mazda 3 at the speed camera also both have to guai guai slow down. You have a bmw m3 also no use, all that speed and power is only for racing to the next petrol station and burning a hole in your wallet.</p>
