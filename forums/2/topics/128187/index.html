I met one who jammed brake outta nowhere and caused me to e brake and many behind me to do so almost causing a chain accident. after which, I horned him to move on, he wound down window and yelled #%^&amp;#%~@@&amp;~( non stop. After dat, he purposely jammed brake again!

            <div class='col-md body'>i have been eyeing these bunch of taxi faggots for a long time, since these taxi drivers refuse to show respect to other road users, i think it's time we treat them like dogs, the authority fails to instil good driving habits in them, it's then ,our turn to teach them a lesson, they want to make life difficult for others, it's time we make life difficult for them, i can assure you this bunch of taxi faggots will get subdued..let's hope these bunch of taxi faggots disappear from our public roads forever</div>
