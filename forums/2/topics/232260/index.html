            <div class='col-md body'>seems like the altis will wanna go back to borneo. so definitely u muz claim from ur van insurance company for the altis repair as well as your own. and you might need to fork out $$, depending on how much your excess is. if there isnt any, then all is well and good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You only got 2 choice, let the company know and pay by insurance or pay by yourself.<br><br>Report to company: Depends on your repo with the company, if the boss likes you, you need not pay a cent. Most of the time, company will deduct from you but not the full price. Maybe like 20% or if your company is farked up type, will ask u to pay all so will not affect their insurance.<br><br>Pay by yourself: You can bring it to a workshop to do. Not necessary go to BM.<br>Bumper + spray will be around $550 +/-. If go to BM, will cost around 1.5k<br>Normally is a 1 1/2 day job.<br><br>You may not be able to use the company insurance if your company says that you are on unauthorise journey or non-job related.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, if the replace cost of the bumper + other eg number plates and knocking some inner absorber etc can easily come to 2-3k. Leave it to your company to decide to claim insurance or not. Anyway what the purpuse of buying insurance and not claiming ? Dont worry too much la as it is an accident.<br><br>Just days ago, our 6 month old Airwave was kissed by an old Mercedes. We send to our PI workshop to evaluate - bumper replace + spray (of course we want to replace the bumper) and the boot was dent but we agree to let them panel it back to shape.. estimated to be about 2k (1k for the bumper). And also claim for transport or rental car for the days the car is undergo repairs. The other party decide to claim insurance also.</div>

First of all, you hitting him behind is a sure win case for the Altis owner.  Your van is covered by insurance, regardless of whether you are sending CRT monitor back for colleague a not.  Insurance covers the vehicle 24 X 7, thats LTA's requirements for a car to be on the road.<br><br>As such, some ppl here say insurance damn ma fan.  Thats not your problem.<br>The Altis will probably make a 3rd party claim on you.  You will have to go back to your company and tell them what happened.  You will also need to fill up a GIA report.  In GIA reports, people will cheat and lie, no one will tell the truth.  In other words, I am a devil's advocate now.  Fill up with a "believable story" that will put you "not in the wrong".  If your own insurance company wants to contest the case, thats their problem not yours.<br><br>Hope this lengthy post helps.  Need more help, feel free to PM me.</div>
