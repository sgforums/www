            <div class='col-md body'>Well have you checked out the latest model of the Lexus RX 300? With its multi-panel moon roof? Which covers like 3/4 of the roof top! Its just great! My sis owns a 1999 Harrier which I have driven a few times, its a pretty good car 3 litre. But, I just got the Lexus RX 300 and its a 3 litre with full interior. Lexus beats the Harrier with pure quality. The small little things add up...<br><br>As for Volvo XC, too many blind spots.<br><br>The X5 definitely beats the rest in terms of car handling.<br><br>The Cayenne though fast, but thats about all and to add the price.<br><br></div>

Who really believes a Skyline is "only" 276bhp? come'on, u've got to be smarter than that?<br><br>I would take a mag's word anyday becuase a motoring mag's job is solely to test, review and compare cars, and bring us, the cosumer, the lowdown on the good, the bad and the ugly, wherelse, manufacturers have their own agendas.<br><br>so now im gonna tell u.<br>your points:<br>1) yes u are right it is more powerful<br>2) yes u are right it is heavier. but do u know anything about torque figures, optimal revs and and torque to weight figures?<br>3)the Lexus is faster on paper but not when it is tested IN REAL LIFE<br>4) Volvo's inline 5 is running a low boost turbo, which provides max torque at a super low 1500rpms(once again, optimal torque at low revs, which U SEEM TO CONVENIENTLY IGNORE)<br>5) Lexus DOES NOT MANAGE TO BE FASTER even though it is NA. read carefully again. LEXUS IS SLOWER.<br><br>until u can understand the whole implication of torque figures and the rev range, pls do not come and argue, because its like trying to argue without logic.<br><br>and oh, i believe that Torque is very unbiased. to be honest i expected the Touareg to win the shootout, but suprise suprise. If u want to suggest they are biased, pls call them up and tell them, and if u want the concrete proof of the testing they did, call them n ask too.<br><br>and i suggest u go and read n understand more about torque and weight.</div>

Simpang or Pasir Gudang Racing circuit. Car park racing.<br><br>Some factors to determined btn a winner &amp; loser is the machine. Another factor if both are having same machine, then it will all boils down to the skill with experience drivers to evolve into man &amp; machine.
