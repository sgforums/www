It's a prorate of the COE that you paid for. Basically its a pretty fair system. U pay for what you used. No additional charges. No penalties for early redemption. Only penalties are those imposed on your car if you scrap early. The % of OMV rebate decreases as time goes by but the impact are on those cars scrapped b4 the 1st 5 years... Government purposely did it to curb "wasteage" on those cars scrapped b4 the 3rd year cos' owners used to get 130% of the OMV rebate if they scrap early under the old PARF system. If your car is pretty new the perhaps on top of the COE rebate, scrap value(PARF) u may also receive an additional amount from the scrap dealer for the car body cos' they will eventually export the car to regional countries if the age of the car is still acceptable...</div>

U mean u are driving a van or truck or something like this? Kangoo, Liteace? whichever. In this case, wat they annotate on your log card is correct. U get zero value back on your vehicle irregardless of when you scrap it. You only get back unused COE thats all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reason is becos Cat C vehicles are treated as company cars. Just like the Q plates of yesteryears which are also considered as company cars. And for company cars, the government will not rebate you a single cent in PARF when you scrap it. Simple logic, company cars are excess population on the road. They eat up COEs yet they dun really function as pple carriers moving the masses around. And equally they contribute to the pollution.<br><br>Its easy to understand why the government wants to do that. Imagine if you are the Tau Kay of a company. And you invest $ and $ to buy a fleet of Q plate Mercs, BMWs etc etc... U charge every single cent that you spent on the fuel, insurance, road tax etc to the company accounts as expenses. What do we have at the end of the day? As the Taxman I can't tax you for profits invested in these cars cos they are company assets. So, you get away wayang with a fleet of glamorous cars, pollute the air and yet you can liquidate these cars for cash anytime. The government realised this mistake and discontinued the Q plate registation. Company cars must be registered as G plates and these belong to Cat C vehicles. Y? No tau kay would go around wayang in a fleet of liteace or kangoo would he? It's a status thing. That's y nowadays there are fewer Q plates on the roads when their 10 years are up. In accounting practice, any $ charged as allowances or reimbursement for S plate vehicles are not considered as valid for company expenses. If the company want to pay for it then it's the company "pasar". These money spent will be included in the computation as profits and companies will still have to pay for the legible tax amount; whether or not they pay their employees these allowances...<br><br>So for you people out there asking for a higher price tag for your car allowances in your job hunt dun grumble that's its shrinking... All the bosses have no choice also...</div>
