This modules are usually found on BMW, Lexus, Benz and are mostly optional.<br><br>if you change bulb, look for a lower colour temperature rating, eg 3800-4200Â° K.<br><br>your HID is usually above 5000Â°K<br><br>but my advice to you, is you add fog lights. fog light bulbs are designed to permeate the fog whereelse a yellowish-white bulb isn't.<br><br>Don't confuse fog lights with driving lights. Driving lights are those small ones you find at the skirt of the bumper. Fog lights are found at the grille although theres no harm moving it to the bumper.<br><br>PM me if you have more questions, i used to do alot of fog driving.</div>

What's a lemon?<br><br>Haha anyway for fog lights, install those rally kind.. that you find on the RAV4s with the prominent TRD stickers. Hahahahah!<br><br>I think workshop can install foglights, but must cover up when in SG. Paiseh ah, hope you don't mind me saying this, but I think HID is really useful, and SG only allow factory-fit HIDs, once you take it out, cannot put in back in.. I want a HID CIVIC also don't have.. can only afford Lancer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>So if you travel rough, IMHO its still better to get the industry fog lights. Don't think its very ex, and can be fitted at most workshops ba..</div>
