            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, have been contemplating an MPV for a month now. Have a few options, but one of deciding factors would have to be fuel consumption and the efficiency of the car. Was told that the Trajet gives approx 8-9km/ltr according to the salesman, and the Picnic gives approx 11-12km/ltr - again, according to the sales rep. I found it quite a staggering difference between the 2 but decided to check around from users to find out more. Any thoughts anyone? How about the new Odyssey?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>trajet is hyundai right? avoid hyundai cars if FC is your primary concern. their FC is actually pretty horrible. several good MPV to recommend are the Renault Espace, Toyota Picnic n Estima, Mitsu Grandis.</div>

Got it from a reliable source that atually the car is strongest at its full tank. Something to do with the pressure of fuel tansfered to the engine.<br><br>Come to think of it, having a full tanks compared to a quarter tank and just like putting a kid on/off the car. Only about 25kg difference. Don't you think that only matters a little to a 1 ton car.<br><br>Anyway, FC of Getz 1.3 is about 9-10km/L. But I was surprise when you guys mentioned Aveo is similar too. 10km/L compared to 15km/L at S$200 spend on petrol a month will amount to S$10k wasted in 10 years.</div>
