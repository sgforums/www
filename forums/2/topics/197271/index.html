Which dealer should i get it from? Mazda or PI? (I understand that PI has the auto version and not Mazda??) What is the difference in the configuration?<br><br>2.  The price as listed under various PIs is rather attractive! I wonder how's the service at their authorised workshops? Is it reliable? They even manage to provide 5 years labor free warranty.

PI always use a lot of gimmicks with a lot of hidden T&amp;C to lure pple.. if MM carries this car i suggest u go to MM for peace of mind..<br><br>3.the fuel consumption for a rotary is notoriously bad.. last i heard is 7km/l on the avg...<br><br>4. i believe insurance shld be quite low since u are 26.. and i assume u not P plate bah...and most insurance co. see CC of car.. so this one 1300 and then can be considered 4 doors.. some sorta loophole...<br><br>5. the old rotary found in the FDs and FCs wears out easily.. but the new one found on the rx-8 is better..

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi DiablosX.<br><br>I am a Lexus Sales Consultant of the Borneo Motors. Read that you are actually considering the Lexus IS250, but disappointed with the Lexus build quality after having read some postings?<br><br>Hmmm strange... as the Lexus had been well known for its build quality. Many forums had even commended that the Lexus engineers had paid a lot of attention to details, such as the quality of the welded joints, the consistent space between every panel and doors, no sharp edges etc.<br><br>Well, this may sound like a 'salesman talk', but you will really have to feel it (and see it) for yourself to believe. May I invite you to the Lexus showroom to take a look at the IS250, as well as go on a test drive?<br><br>My name's Jonathan. Do feel free to call me at 96882200 if you are interested.<br><br>Cheerios!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks DiablosX. I have replied your PM.<br><br>Anyway I have read that thread at MyCarForum. Let me say this: that guy can absolutely find no other flaws with the Lexus technology and build quality, so he has to resort to picking out the tiniest bit of whatever "flaw" he can chance upon.<br><br>I mean, if Lexus is so lousy, he can very well say how lousy the engine is, or how flimsy the panels felt. Then he wouldn't have to resort to picking out the 1mm or half mm faults.<br><br>Let our intellect decide.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

PI always use a lot of gimmicks with a lot of hidden T&amp;C to lure pple.. if MM carries this car i suggest u go to MM for peace of mind..<br><br>3.the fuel consumption for a rotary is notoriously bad.. last i heard is 7km/l on the avg...<br><br>4. i believe insurance shld be quite low since u are 26.. and i assume u not P plate bah...and most insurance co. see CC of car.. so this one 1300 and then can be considered 4 doors.. some sorta loophole...<br><br>5. the old rotary found in the FDs and FCs wears out easily.. but the new one found on the rx-8 is better.. HENG@ got mention b4 but i forgot the explanation liaoz... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>1: Totally agree with that statement coz if you opt for the auto you will never get the 9.5k rpm of the rx8 that the whole world was crazy about when it was first launched.<br><br>2: Go for MM coz rotary is not the usual piston outside workshop is familiar with and furthermore you won't get updated ECU programme from PI ...and that's for sure. The last time RE Amemiya had a free ECU update guys who bought his RX8 from PI went crazy over it for the slot and guess wat... those are limited slots.... so why bother begging for something when you have paid 100k for it??<br><br>3. I HAVE TO TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THE 7KM/L. I have been driving a 6MT RX8 from MM for 2 years now and averaging 8.2 - 8.8 KM /L .... no bs about it . (singapore driving of course- and FYI those who said they are getting 7km/l coz they have no clue how to drive a car efficiently .... even you give them a hybrid they will still complaint about the fuel comsumption\<br><br>4: Insurance is definitely the cheapeast among high performance car of its class ........<br><br>5: Listen to someone who has been driving the car and not some "rumours" out there. I track my car on a monthly basis in sepang (hard driving and I am talking about every gear to the 9k rpm and consecutively for 12 hard laps non stop )and have been having the car for 2 years now ...... guess wat .... all I have done to the car is a simple top up petrol and normal oil change service from MM which cost me $130 and the car has never given me a SINGLE problem at all. On top of that the build quality of the interior is so good that it doesn not rattle at all even after two years.<br><br>not to brag but to prove a point ... if someone really want to buy this car and I think you really should talk to someone who owns the car and not from someone "who" claimed to be the GURU in all cars ....... 5 cents worth<br><br></div>
