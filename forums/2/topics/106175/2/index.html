The ECU sends a variable duty cycle to a pulse width modulated solenoid that works like an injector. By adjusting and directing the amount of oil pumped into the CVTC's chambers and allowed to drain back into the engine, the ECU controls the retard or advance of the cam up to 30 crank degrees (vs. 14 degrees on the older VTC motors). The cam is retarded at idle to create a smoother idle and decrease emissions, advanced in the mid range to increase breathing, and retarded at high rpm to increase peak horsepower and fuel efficiency. VTEC is like having a stock cam at low rpm and a race cam at high rpm. At high rpm, the VTEC solenoid opens to allow oil from the oil pump to flow to a piston in the rocker arm. This piston engages a lost motion rocker in an extra intake cam, locking it to the two rockers that control both intake valves. The intake valve on this second cam profile remains open longer which increases breathing.

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I think NS FC is not that bad. People have preference for car and they severly down play the other cars especially the direct competitor.<br><br>FC is very much subjective. All depends on the driver. If he/she wants to pull out from parking position fast with high revs. of course the FC is poor. Also if on the highway I have seen drivers think they can save petrol by pump and release...pump and release the accelerator making the whole car jerk like crazy. Pathetic attempt to save fuel leads to higher FC. Just drive normally and not like a maniac. Accelerate gradually and try to keep at a constant speed on highway.<br><br>As for power, what power one wants. Can they really tell the difference between in power the toyota and sunny. Singapore is such a small place and a relatively flat island don't think that a slighly higher power will make a large difference unless one wants to drive up Mount Faber everyday.<br><br>So, unlike other country where cars are so much cheaper, unless one have money to burn, go for where your budget can take you. I have seen many foolish people who want this and want that in a car trying to stretch their budget to get their dream car. End up eating maggi mee everyday. Ridiculous!<br></div>

Yeh right other cars like toyota corolla is averaging 13-14 Km/L without doing anything. Here you are boasting Nissan Sunny good after you have to take out spare type, repair kit ... put redex ( car drugs ) just to achieve what other car acheive ...... come on who are you kidding, if the FC is not so horrible, would you have need to do the above . Haha !!! talk about slaping own face !!!!<br><br>And now compare with sunny with newer cars like vios and city , people are getting 17-20km/L .... poor sunny with drugs and taken out everything still doing that poor !!!
