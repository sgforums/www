It should get you to KL in a tank, anyway there are a few rest point along the way with petrol kiosks so if you not too sure, can play safe and top up.<br><br>Getz will be a good choice .<br><br>For Ignis - 1.3L. I will not recommend that, it is a little underpower, as you are new to driving to KL, it is alway good to have a car that have some extra reserve power in case you need it to overcome some unexpected road situation.<br><br>Why don't you get a saloon car, then consider things matrix, a saloon car usually handle better in turns, and more stable, which sure help a lot for someone who driving up unfamiliar roads.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there<br><br>give you some insight and real life story.<br><br>I drove my 1.2 corsa up to KL with not much problem also. I also managed to hit 160km/h. At this speed, you may think is damn fast but when u drive over there, you realise thatyou are not driving fast at all becos a lot of vehicles dirving at that speed but be very careful with where you stop. Never lift your belongings inside the car.<br><br>My friend and gf left their bags inside&gt; he drove a mazda 323 with ALARM. But when they got back, no window smash and they parked the place (can;t rmemeber the nameo f place but after Yong Peng) where a lot ofpeople stopped for a rest. and they lost their stuff. Piss off. We have to report police at Tangkat but when we were theere, we were told that Muar is then the right place. Prior to that, we called but were told to go Tangkat instead... anyway.. we bo chup, my friend knew a little melayu so insisted that they rpeort there. Guess what, we must pay RM4 to make a report. lol<br><br>anywaycut the story short, dirving there is not a problem with whatever car or at least i have no prob with my 1.2 car but ensure you have Rm4 keep in your boots / shoes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> just in case</div>
