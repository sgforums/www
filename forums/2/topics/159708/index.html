            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I find that the female SEs are there not to "sex" sell a car. They seem to be able to get into the female decision maker's mind easier than the male Ses. Dun forget, once you are married, the wife is the major and you are the general. And buying car is major decision.<br><br>Seeing them as sex objects is a self perception. It depends on the individual who is being served.</div>

On the other hand, similar one from Suzuki just can't make it. Completely can't sell. 2 times in Suzuki Ubi showroom, both unhappy experience.<br><br>So I would say it is definitely a plus to have a chio female SE who know her stuff. However, it is still the car that is selling not the SE. In the end, I bought mine from a "ka-wan".</div>
