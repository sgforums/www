            <div class='col-md body'>There was a similar 'scam' in Melbourne a few years ago.  A van would pull up and say they were delivering hi-fi speakers but dispatch had given them X pairs of speakers when the order was for X speakers, so they were selling half their delivery at dirt-cheap prices.  My friend bought a pair and I ended up with them.  They're actually remarkable speakers for $400/pair, as good as speakers costing three times that much.<br>Anyway, why I put 'scam' in quotes, is that I found out the operation was quite legit.  These fellows were manufacturing speakers cheaply specifically to sell in that manner.  They weren't stolen or sold illegally and the only thing wrong was their dubious sales technique.<br>So, there's often more than meets the eye with these things.  I don't however recommend buying from vans on the street though!</div>
