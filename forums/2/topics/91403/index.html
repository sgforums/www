            <div class='col-md body'>then heres what i suggest. bear with the car for a while more. then get rid of it when its less damaging on your wallet to do so, and get a manual car. Maybe your mom hardly uses it anymore, but she might still use it. she DID chip in $$$ so bear with it. Anyways, there are lots of side issues which may arise from you doing a conversion. seems to me to be a really expensive way to tackle a problem based on feeling alone.</div>
