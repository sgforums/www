            <div class='col-md body'>I don like ppl who give me middle fingers.. not to mentin SPIT on my window. One word of advice.. just be cool.. coz if u were to have spat on me , trust me.. there are times where u walk alone. If u love your car.. its not wise .. or u becoe collateral damage.  People seldom recognise the person..but hell they sure recognise the car. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  Man i have lots of road rage encounters... most of them i have to admit i am to blame myself...coz when i am drunk.. i am always the one on road rage !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
