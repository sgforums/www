            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is bidding to become the latest addition to the increasingly crowded Formula 1 calendar after disclosing plans to host a race within the next three years.<br><br>Meetings have been held between the Singapore Motor Sports Association (SMSA) and the countryÂ’s tourist board about the feasibility of staging a city-centre event on a street circuit.<br><br>A site on the seafront has been ear-marked, and a 3.8 km (2.4-mile) layout has already been sketched out.<br><br>Â“We met with the Singapore Tourist Board late last year to discuss it in a feasibility study group, and weÂ’ve knuckled down the exact roads for a possible F1 street circuit since,Â” said SMSA president Matthew Lee in an interview with SingaporeÂ’s Electric New Ppaer.<br><br>Lee admitted that Singapore will only stand a chance of luring the F1 circus if the tourism board agrees to underwrite the project.<br><br>Lee anticipates a set-up cost of Â£16 million for the street circuit and an annual outlay of Â£7-10 million, predominantly in rights fees to F1 promoter Bernie Ecclestone.<br><br>Â“Money talks first, especially when it comes to Bernie Ecclestone,Â” he said. Â“This is an open secret in the world of Formula 1.Â”<br><br>The proposed route for the circuit passes some of SingaporeÂ’s most recognised landmarks, including Raffles Hotel and the Victoria Concert Hall.<br><br>Lee believes the wide city streets would lend themselves to overtaking while providing some of the challenge of classic urban venues such as Monaco and Macau.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A quick search on Google news will reveal that SMSA has disavowed any attempt to get on the F1 schedule. The F1 tsar himself has stated that Singapore is too close to Sepang, and Singapore would be an unlikely venue.<br><br>I think we lost out to M'sia, and missed the boat on this one way after the boat has left as LKY had admitted, that it was a "stupid decision" not to allow F1 here. It just vexes me, as racing enthusiasts had been begging for a track in Singapore for decades.<br><br>Personally, at the end, i think racig im M'sia is better. It's cheaper, they have more spece, and they have more support. In S'pore, the TPs are so busy catching speedsters and fining them, I seriously doubt that they would consider a track. May be if FTs asked for one tho...<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth.<br></div>
