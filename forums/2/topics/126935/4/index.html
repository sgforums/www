Why? LAND COST<br><br><blockquote>yes, sentosa operates 27/7/365 but what is the number of ppl that visit it versus the number of businesses and land area it currently boasts? if it can survive, i dun see y a dedicated world class circuit couldn't. </blockquote>Sentosa is not run by a SINGLE company dude, there are lots of private companies in Sentosa running very diversified businesses. Over the years, some have gone belly up while some are still making decent profits.<br><br>It will be stupid to think that by having a world class structure, it will bring you world class success. How special can a world class circuit be if there are no world class event?<br><br><blockquote> at the end of the day, i think u shd not isolate the existence of the support we can garner from our neighbouring countries who have can now have accessible means to boost their motorsports events.</blockquote>We can still host motorsport events with a street circuit right? And beside that, what makes you think that MY will support singapore to build a F1 circuit when their Sepang circuit is only 300km from singapore?<br><br></div>
