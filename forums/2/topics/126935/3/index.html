Are you willing to do the same? If not then you should not ask why there are so many golf courses in Singapore. (btw, those land are not FOC)<br><br><blockquote><br>a) the government can support a project like this not just in terms of funding. by offering rebates in terms of various taxes, it can also result in a win-win situation for them when foreign investors capitalize on this opportunity to pitch in. </blockquote>You only enjoy tax rebate if your business make money. I would call it a lose=lose situation here. Why would foreign investor want to invest in a project that doesnt make business sense.<br><br><blockquote><br>b) u have think out of the box. F1 is not the only race series capable of drawing big crowds. weekly open track days are also possible and would be a welcome option for ppl like me who have to drive 300 kms to SIC in order to have a decent track session. i m certain neither one of us would have the number crunching competency to churn out a projected revenue in this case, else we wouldn't be discussing this on an open forum.</blockquote>Yeah I know there are other race series, but how big a crowd are you talking about, and how much $ can you draw from these crowd? $500 per ticket to watch?<br><br>For a 15 year leasehold recreation land in singapore, it should be at least $200 per sqm and this will cost you $180m for the land and $200m for the contruction. Base on financing cost of 5% per year, your yearly interest payment to the bank will be $19m for a $350m loan.  Assuming your contract with FIA is only 6 years, you must be able to recover all the investment within the first 3 years and start to make profit in the last 2 years.<br><br>I will leave the rest of the calculation to your own imagination.<br><br><blockquote><br>c) this is a scenario is as likely to happen as it is not to. did the builders of SIC, bahrain, spain... circuits ever think of this possible eventuality before they decided to build their tracks? land constraints aside, but why did they go ahead and dump millions into building the tracks anyway? IMO, it takes calculated risks to make reasonable gains. if we are always behaving and thinking like scared chicken sh!ts, we'll never take that first step to achieving anything.<br></blockquote>Before you take any risk, you must first ask why you want to take such a risk. If I can host a F1 race with just $50m investment on a street circuit, then why do I want to take UNNECESSARY risk to invest in the $380 million project that generate almost the same returns. Calculated risk? I think this is suicider.<br><br>[/quote]</div>

In addition, most will move out of their existing HDB after 40 years. Due to redevelopment projects, so there is no point doing a 999 freehold landed property.<br>The main reason for the difference will be that malaysia is much bigger than singapore ( in term of land size)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well there is still champcars,touring cars and even F3....and y not charge ppl a small track fee for using the circuit by laps? just like the nurburgring...and i can say with that circuit those speedsters have no excuse 4 speeding liao and the penalties will be even more severe...as the govt will say "we got a circuit...y dun u do yr fancy stuff there instead of the rd?" i think that will really help in decreasing the no. of illegal racing etc...heck we can even hold our own leagues here</div>

Calculated risk? I think this is suicider.</strong> </blockquote>risks are a necessity in any business. ur claim of that risk being unnecessary is primarily based on ur self perceived concerns. of course, anyone is entitled to their own opinions, but i wouldn't go as far to say that a project to build a circuit is deemed to be doomed to failure. this was probably one move our government missed out on then and regretted now because they had ppl who had the same mentality as u.</div>
