            <div class='col-md body'>More vroom for the Singapore buzz<br>Sources say bidders such as Tabcorp are including F1 motor racing in resort plans<br><br>By ALEXANDRA HO<br><br>(SINGAPORE) Australian gaming company Tabcorp could help bring the king of motor racing events here - Formula One.<br><br>Sources have told BT the idea is part of Tabcorp's Request for Concepts submission for an integrated resort (IR). It has put in proposals for both the Sentosa and Marina Bayfront sites.<br><br>Just last week, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew publicly expressed his regret that he did not allow F1 racing here - along with the chance to attract the accompanying glamour, excitement and money.<br><br>The buzz has been building lately that the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) is keen to persuade F1 to make Singapore a leg of its tour.<br><br>The amount of money needed to bring the race here is high - but the two IRs could help tip the balance in Singapore's favour.<br><br>Contacted yesterday, a Tabcorp spokesman said the company doesn't comment on rumours or speculation.<br><br>But other sources said Tabcorp isn't the only gaming company with the F1 idea. Other IR bidders seriously considered putting the F1 race on the table as part of their concepts. And BT understands that some have thought of staging the F1 race on Sentosa.<br><br>In an email reply to The New Paper, STB had said it 'has been actively looking at the development of a motorsports event in Singapore . . . that would be consistent with our profile as an exciting destination'.<br><br>STB is said to be more interested in a street circuit, where the Schumachers, Alonsos and Trullis could race through the civic district.<br><br>Millions of television viewers worldwide would see the drivers zoom past City Hall and Parliament House, with Singapore's skyline providing a dramatic backdrop.<br><br>Bringing F1 races would not be cheap. Sources say it could cost $200 million to set up a dedicated circuit. And even for a street circuit, the bill could run to $40-50 million, including direct and indirect costs such as closing businesses along the track, setting up barriers, security, and putting in pit stops for race tyre changes and petrol top-ups.<br><br>STB is reportedly willing to help with the funding - up to 30 per cent. The rest would come from sponsors and partners.<br><br>If F1 were to come here, it wouldn't happen overnight. Although STB is believed to be in early talks with different players, the timeline to bring the race would likely be about four years, BT understands.<br><br>STB was not available for comment late last night.<br><br>Some have raised doubts on whether Singapore can snare an F1 race; they say there are enough Asian legs in the tour. Even F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has reportedly said he does not think it is possible because Singapore is too near Malaysia's Sepang F1 circuit. Mr Ecclestone had not replied to email enquiries from BT late last night.<br><br>But some have pointed out that the European legs of the F1 race are held in close proximity to one another - in France, Spain, Italy, San Marino, the UK, Belgium and Germany, all of which are relatively close geographically. In fact, the European legs take up more than half - or 10 - of the season's 19 races.<br><br>Observers have told BT the Singapore government probably has more political will now than ever to make F1 racing here a reality. They point to MM Lee's comments last week as proof. 'I learnt a lesson and I'm telling my younger chaps - 'look, pay attention to all this. This is what will make Singapore buzz,' ' he said.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think in the end it all still boils down to the dough. How much Singapore is willing to spend as well as how stuffed Bernie would like his pocket to be. Apparently Sepang's contract ends in 2006? I think we stand a pretty good chance. If they really want it badly, we could even see a track in 2006 ready for use. A businessman in Dubai started his own racing league, and got his track ready in about 90 days if I remember correctly. That's 3 months! I believe we will get both tracks, the one in Tuas and another in Marina. Only a matter of time guys, time to save up for that race machine!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Cheers</div>

F1 is not the only race series capable of drawing big crowds. weekly open track days are also possible and would be a welcome option for ppl like me who have to drive 300 kms to SIC in order to have a decent track session. i m certain neither one of us would have the number crunching competency to churn out a projected revenue in this case, else we wouldn't be discussing this on an open forum.<br><br>c) this is a scenario is as likely to happen as it is not to. did the builders of SIC, bahrain, spain... circuits ever think of this possible eventuality before they decided to build their tracks? land constraints aside, but why did they go ahead and dump millions into building the tracks anyway? IMO, it takes calculated risks to make reasonable gains. if we are always behaving and thinking like scared chicken sh!ts, we'll never take that first step to achieving anything.<br><br></div>
