I will also be getting my 1K service on April 5th and will drive up to Penang on April 9 and be back on April 11.<br><br>So, I will have info to share on its ability to cruise on the highway and its reliability.

It seems that I can last one day longer. This is not exactly a scientific answer but then I usually know that I need a top (full) up each week with my beemer. In this case, it seems to last one day longer.<br><br>Now after the service (done on April 5), it seems to be still behaving the same (even after 3 days from then only) even though I am pushing it - went 6000rpm on ECP to hit 120kmh from a side road.<br><br>I think I will have more to say on this after my Penang trip. However, I am the type that does not count the mileage in terms of km/l but more on do I need a full tank every week.<br><br>P.S. The service centre in Kaki Bukit should be more careful when getting in and out of new cars. They left their dirty toe print (dirty boot cap mark) on my nice beige interior!<br><br></div>

At least you do not need to have the embellishment now plated to gold - saw one LS430 doing that - what a waste and so beng.<br><br>So, far no issue with the car. But when it rains, it brings back memories of how it sound when rain hits the zinc roof of old houses.<br><br>Wonder whether the v6 engine will have a consumption difference. It sounds so much sweeter when you pull the v6 compared to the 4 cycl (during test drive).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Penang Trip Report<br>--------------------------<br>The TP was out in force. Could not get past the toll after the immigration checkpoint (Msian side) on 2nd link before being flagged for speeding. Was told that my speed tagged was 136kph. Reckon it was a fair deal as I hit 160. "Paid" the settle now amount instead of settle later ;-)<br><br>Good Points of 230JM<br>==================<br>1. Nice V6 response when you floor the throttle. Nice sound too.<br>2. The salesman was wrong. The limit is still capped at 180pkh although the speedo says max is 240. Instead of a cut off, it just stays at 180<br>3. Air-con was very good even under the hot sun<br>4. Passengers felt the car was very comfortable<br>5. A lot of admirers as it seems this model is still not available in M'sia<br><br>Bad Points of 230JM<br>=================<br>1. Insulation is very poor. Besides the car sounding like a zinc hut during a rain, the tyre noise from the Michelin Pilot Sport is very jarring.<br>2. The driver seat is not as good as the old 520 BMW<br>3. Steering is over sensitive. Slight movement causes car to move in response. Should put in some damping to cut off slight accidental movement<br>4. Consumption is a bit on the high side. But then this is 2300 cc, so I guess it is expected to drink a bit more. I think about the same as my 520 BMW.<br>5. Brake not so elegant as the one on BMW. But can live with it<br>6. Car movement on winding roads is quite an affair. Even with better tyres you cannot take it too easy on the winding downhill roads near Ipoh/Taiping.<br>7. 180 kph limit is a wee bit too much as the protons are doing 200 now.<br><br>Others<br>======<br>Going up North is tricky. Got lost trying to find highway out of KL. Ends up in Sg Buloh. It is not me only as a group of SG bikers were lost too.<br><br>Anyway, all is well and we reach Sheraton in Penang at 4.30 pm and we started in East Coast Singapore at 6.10am. Delay was due to getting lost in KL and also due to trying to be a good boy doing 110 and 90 kph after the paying the "fine".<br><br>Return was better as we left hotel at 6.00 am approx. and we were able to get to Kulai (had to run an errand there) at 12.30 pm. Average speed was 150kph. Paid another "fine" somewhere in Negri Sembilan - doubtful that they caught me - reason was the way they greeted me. Told me I was speeding but did not tell me what speed I was caught.<br><br>Stopped for breakfast (some town in Penang) and lunch at the Ayer Keroh stop in Malacca. (3 other stops for restroom breaks)<br><br>Re-fueled 4 times - total RM 180 - full when I left and full when I got back.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eutjin:</div><div class="quote_body">what made you change from a beemer to a nissan?  cost?</div></blockquote>The beemer was year 2000 model. Looks good and is the one that won a lot of awards. No question that the handling and brakes is far superior to the Nissan.<br><br>It was near 4 years old when I sold off for the cefiro. Several incidents made me give up on bmw. Service quality - the car is a regular at Kampong Arang centre. Items that are not suppose to go seems to be going in my case. Even if they claim warranty for you, you still ending up paying for the workmanship which is more than the parts. Changing an item means exactly that. They do NOT check related items. Example, they change the steering pump. A few weeks later they change the hose that leads out from the pump. Then they tell me to change the rod after a month. Why can't they give the whole steering system a once over and recommend all at once! Maybe each job there is a base charge? They like to see my car in their workshop more often?<br><br>In a way it is cost (repairs and loss of use) and in a way frustration that I got a "lemon".<br><br>So, far (touch wood) the cefiro is performing as expected - the 180 kph cap was what I told the salesman but he says that not for this car - now the truth is known.<br><br>Forgot to comment that the Kenwood stereo is kind of "ah beng" with its coloured backlit. Anyone feels that way too?<br><br>A friend who went to the showroom over the weekend was told that changing the tyres will void warranty. That must be the BIGGEST bs  EVER! Just because you wanted better tyres for the price, they tell you this story. The original tyres is a joke. And if you treasure your life and wanted something becoming to the quality of the car, change it.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One good test is the filter road that joins ECP going to airport via the beach road entry point. That is quite steep. Rev it up and see whether it pulls up the slope comfortably.<br><br>I just came back from another Cefiro test drive (a friend is interested to upgrade from Corolla to this). The 200 sounds like it was farting when my friend accelerated into the ECP. However, the 230 was sweet. Power also is substantially different as I understand it.<br><br>Anyway, you have bought the 200 so just enjoy it as it stands 'cos it is never possible to be satisfied. I felt that I should have bought the 350 but then I also understand that in Singapore it would be a waste to get a 350.<br><br>Good news is that both of us can only hit 180kph so I cannot brag that I can go faster. lol<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been driving the cefiro 230 for quite some time now, didn't experience that 'creeking' handrest.  Mine's black so it looks relatively well suited for younger drivers.<br><br>Exterior wise, i was thinking of adding one of those lower spoilers at the rear.  And maybe change the wiper ( put it to full speed and fell the car shake ), as well as changing the rims.  Rims wise, 15 inc for front and 16 for rear seems fine, too bad its hard to get those chrome ones they sell over in the states over here.<br><br>Engine performance is what most people look at though.  I only managed to kick the engine to 140-160 on singapore roads.  Could tell the v6 could be stretched a little further.<br><br>All in all, i think the new cefiro is a decent sedan with good performance.  Only gripe i have about it is the god damn fuel consumption.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone has the new versions with the VCD player? Any comments about it? Heard from my SE that it will only work if you have the foot brake on. Is that true? Also can it be modified to become a GPS set? Thanks<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>My dad is a 'DIE-HARD' fan of NISSAN, driving only nissan cars for the past 30 years. Believe it or not, we didn't even test drive the new cefrio and just bought it. My dad was driving the 'BlueBird' but gotta 'kill' it after 8 years due to COE running out. In certain ways, BlueBird is a good car, low fuel comsumption, smooth, but there are no AIRBAGS, which my dad is a bit considered about.<br><br>Anyway, my personal experience with cefrio is also quite mixed. My dad has the 2 litre version and I have to admit the pick up speed is rather slow when compared to the 'Bluebird' and definitely the new cefrio is much heavier and has a 'EURO' look.<br><br>The interiors is definitely quite 'impressive' for a Jap car and the stereo set is 101% BENG!!! colours change a the time!!!!<br><br>The luggage space is really huge and leg space is also not a problem.<br><br>But there is 1 thing that is 'disturbing' to my dad...there is no CLOCK in the car...other than the stereo.<br>Old people dun like to play with AH BENG stereo....<br>want to see a actuall clock!!!<br><br>I have not done any calculations to FC, but i can feel that the new cefrio is much more thirsty than the BlueBird,.....<br><br>Rgds,<br><br>Ricardo<br></div>
