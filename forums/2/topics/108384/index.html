            <div class='col-md body'>oh yeah. a car roughly clocks 20000 to 30000 km every year if driven frequently. that is if u drive it from changi to tuas and back everyday for a whole year. its a reasonable mileage. so for 134000km, it shld be around 4.5 to 6.5 yrs old. if it is younger than that, it has been driven a lot. ie. maybe to KL and back often (which isnt good). if it is very very old (14 yrs old or so), best to avoid the car. either its been driven so much that 1 cycle was completed, or its been used very little (maybe it spent much of the time in car workshops??). haha. juz my opinion and hopefully, a rough guide for u.</div>

FC is between 10.5 (for city driving and "zhua" all the way type) to between 12.5-13 average 50% city 50% expressway.<br><br>Normally use 95 petrol. If you want slightly better pick up, try 98 or better and you can feel the difference. Forget about 92 with march 1L auto. cannot make it "phui"<br><br>My have ABS, leather sit, child lock. Only complain is no bodkit and reverse sensor.<br><br>But if you want to cheap and relaible car, March, being Japan made, is definately better then others.<br><br>Top speed for full load of 5ppl is about 110km/h. If just you alone, can go up to 130km /hr no prob. only thing is remember to change the tyre. Original type is small and bad at cornering. I change my to a bigger rim and broader base and it help in improving the handling.<br><br>Only complain is boot is damm bloody small and pickup is not fast if used with 95 petrol.<br><br>By the way I test drive Kia picanto auto as well. This car can, being twin cam, can beat it anytime. The rev at high speed aroung 90Km/h is smoother than Picanto which tend to be noiser. Pickup is also slightly better.<br><br>Yes 1L car, its definately the king and have one of the biggest 1L cabin space.<br><br>Hope the info help.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Lahgal<br><br>If buy 2nd hand car, ask the sales rep if he can get from the original owner all receipt for repair and regular maintainance.<br><br>Responsible drivers who look after car will keep it as a reference how often he check his car and replace parts.<br><br>Watch out for repairs that are done which is normally not due to wear and tear. If car owner goes for regular servicing, then it a good sign too which mean car will tend to have less prob. Note: Nissan march has a list of item to check till 100k mile servicing. So that should give you a good guage of how the different part is functioning. Thing like Air con/radiator shouldn't give any prob at all e.t.c....<br><br>Check for car history esp if kanna "kiss" before. Insist of seeing the repair bills if it is a accident car to the front. You never know what kind of internal damage done. If possible. bring a mechanic along during inspection. Ask for freind to recommand you thier regular mechanic and treat him a good lunch and some $$ should help you alot along the way...<br><br>Finally once you get the car, send for major 50k or 100k servicing. Will help to tune the car back to better condition. FC will generally improve slightly as well after that.<br><br></div>

To be a bit technical, the gear ratio for 4th gear is abt or slightly lower than the manual 5th gear. So with the same engine speed, it will reach the same speed, everything else being constant,  you are not at a disadvantage with one less gear in the sense.</div>
