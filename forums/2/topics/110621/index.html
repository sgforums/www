            <div class='col-md body'>Hi folks,<br><br>Need actual opinions of fellow forummers who own either cars, as I'm torn between the two. I'm comparing the "sports version" of the 2 so that to give equal footing. Note that the "sports version" of both cars have nothing to do with engine, performance, or other internal parts; they're just a collection of external accessories for the car to look "sportier". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'm actually looking at the Hatchback version of the Cerato. Next shipment is only due come April '05.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> I've test driven both cars, and the following is wat i've found:<br><br><strong>Built</strong><br>I must say that the Cerato's built is impressive! Unlike older Kia's where u'll have to worry abt closing the doors too tightly (lest the hinges and windows fall off), the Cerato closes with a solid "thump". I guess Kia has made significant improvements, among other things?<br><br><strong>Interior</strong><br>Honestly, the interior of the standard "stock" version of Cerato is very, very, very, very bland. One look at it and I dun want to even get in. However, for $3k more, you'll get a "Premium Edition" with Sports Rims, Leather Interior and Touchscreen DVD player. Defi. worth the money if u ask me.<br><br>Having said that, I still prefer the interior of the "sports version" of the lancer. The overall "feeling" when i'm at the driver's seat beats the Cerato.<br><br><strong>Specs</strong><br>Specs and BHP-wise, both cars are very similiar, except that Lancer uses SOHC, Cerato uses DOHC. The Cerato though, has a bigger and roomier interior, and lots of legspace for rear passengers. The rear passengers seats of the hatchback can be folded down for added storage space.<br><br><strong>Price</strong><br>Currently, the price difference between the two is about $10k (estimated).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cerato</strong></span><br>(Like)<br>- Shape (Hatchback)<br>- Quality of built<br>- Features (foldable seats, little pockets of storage space here and there etc)<br><br>(Dislike)<br>- Brandname (kia  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> )<br>- Probable poor resale value<br>- Reliability issue (korean vs japanese technology and reliability)<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lancer</strong></span><br>(Like)<br>- Very sporty shape<br>- Probable higher resale value<br>- Nice and solid interior<br><br>(Dislike)<br>- Price<br><br><strong>Questions</strong><br>1) One thing i'm not sure is fuel consumption, as Korean cars are never known to be fuel-friendly. Any one got any feedback on FC for both cars?<br>2) What's the difference between DOHC and SOHC engines? Is the difference noticeable in everyday driving?<br>3) Are Korean cars really as bad as the market makes it out to be? I've heard horror stories of Korean cars falling to pieces after 3,4 years of driving, even with decent maintenance. I'm no car expert, and I don't know the internal circuitry or engineering underneath the hood of the Cerato, but it certainly feels solid enough to warrant a serious consideration.<br><br>Any further comments from actual owners of the above 2 cars? Any comments will be appreciated. Any at all.<br><br>Thanks in advance!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from what you have posted above, i can honestly say i think you should decide on which car to get based on your priorities.<br><br>the lancer. sporty, more expensive, less economical. but hey you're a young guy (i think) and if you have the cash to go for it by all means go ahead! the lancer is indeed a fun car to drive no doubt.<br><br>the kia on the other hand. this i'd have to say is a more "family" car. more economical, quieter, tamer, and cheaper of course. but i'm rather sure not as much fun as the lancer.<br><br>so we come back to the point of why are you getting this car? for the love of driving? to get from point A to point B quicker than taking a bus?<br><br>think about what you really need/want and base your decision on that. anyhow, no matter what decision you make, both are great cars and you can't go too wrong.<br><br>btw i have write-up on my site on the cerato which you might want to take a look at. <a href="http://www.rpmportal.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=11" rel="nofollow">ARTICLE LINK HERE</a><br><br>good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Go for the lancer if u have the $$ bro... for kia, i have a neighbour who keeps complaining abt his cerato abt the fuel consumptions which he just bought it for abt 2 months ago. For lancer, i admit its handling wise is far much more better than kia and it last longer for lancer. Kia is more like a family like car. Korean car not that reliable to me lah...Trust me...its more fun to drive a japanese car...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>Thanks for all the comments!<br><br>Just browsed thru the SG KIA Club, and the main problem with the car seems to be FC. The Cerato drinks petrol as if the tanks leaking  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> , and the average, at best FC clocked is 10km/l?!?!<br><br>That's the figure for a MANUAL Cerato, with all the fuel saving, super light footing, constant RPM watching, on-off airconditioning, watch the limit kind of driving. Can't imagine what the FC figure will be like for normal driving without all these "techniques".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Could be due to the weight of the car, but I'm sure there are other factors too.<br><br>Seems like i gotta fork out a bit more the Lancer now.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello.<br><br>$10k for petrol may seem a lot, but i think it isn't? Let's take the following example:<br><br>Assuming<br>- driving both cars for full 10 years.<br>- both cars full tank capacity @ 50L<br>- Lancer FC @ 13km/l, Careto FC @ 10km/l<br>- Petrol price @ $1.40/l<br>- barring costs of maintenance, langar, road tax, insurance bla bla etc.<br>- interest @ 2.45% incurs additional cost of $2,450. total cost is $10k + $2,450 = $12,450.<br><br>If I divide $12,450 by 10 years and by 12 months, each month I'll be paying additional $100 (thereabouts) more for a Lancer instead of a Cerato.<br><br>At the cost of $70 full tank, a Lancer goes 650km while the Cerato goes only 500km. A couple more full tanks, and the cost petrol for the Cerato should be about the same as the additional price of $100 per month for a Lancer.<br><br>Since the additional cost of $100 of a Lancer is offset by potential fuel savings, I guess I'm paying nothing for Japanese handling, reliability and technology.

            <div class='col-md body'>if you are buying Lancer, think you should wait for Lancer to drop its price further. COE has dropped about 5k but Lancer has only dropped 2k. Really not a wise choice now, car dealers are holding back the diff which they should give back to buyers.<br><br>Whereas for other 1.6 cars, they have dropped about 4k. For new model Cerato, the diff is about 8k.</div>
