              <p>Just warning you guys. It happened to me today, just awhile ago. As I was exiting the century square carpark turning right towards the barrier, I noticed a malay male in his early 20s standing behind a pillar. As I drove pass him, all of a sudden he smacked the back of my car and was crouching. Naturally I got out of my car and asked him what happened. He claimed I had ran over his foot and showed me a cut on his toe.</p>
              <p>I asked him if he needed me to send him to a doctors and he said OK. So I asked him where his car was(i mean he was in an underground carpark. Why would you be there if you did not have a car?) He said his supervisor "dropped him off" he has no car. This is when I got suspicious.</p>
              <p>He then said nevermind just give him 10$ to see a doctor. So I told him no way i was giving him cause it obviously wasnt my fault (he was standing behind a pillar. If I hit him I obviously would have hit the pillar). He wouldn't let me leave and kept asking me how then how then wanna send him to hospital now ? </p>
              <p>I told him it wasn't my fault and I wasn't going to pay but he just wouldn't leave me alone and showed me his toe. He then went to rub his cut and showed me some blood. With all the cars waiting to exit and my car blocking off the traffic in the carpark, I reluctantly handed him 10$ to which he replid "ok thanks" and walked off like nothing happened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i just want to warn you guys about this hopefully it doesn't happen to anyone. One again the fella is a Malay male roughly in his twenties. He was wearing a T-shirt and jeans with slippers.</p>
