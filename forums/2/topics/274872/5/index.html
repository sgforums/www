            <div class='col-md body'>nothing against china cars or "whatever-country-made" cars, as long as their safety standard are kept in place. as some of them mentioned, is not you who create the accident but some other careless/reckless drivers that comes into your path... and looking at the crash test vehicles... bro you must really be CAREFUL!<br>as for the 10years loan, my advice (if it's not too late) to revise to a shorter loan term, cos you might change your mind after driving it and you can't change unless you're willing to fork out the remaining "penalty".
