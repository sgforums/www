            <div class='col-md body'>remembered reading in the papers... there was an article on cars on lane 1 not giving way to ambulances or emergency vehicles... and these emergency vehicles have on-board camera to snap a picture of your fat-ass car obstructing their way.... if caught, its up to $1000 or jail up to 3 months. Keep blatently doing it again... you'll eventually lose your licence.<br><br>So make it a habit to check your rear-view mirror from time to time while travelling ... what's so difficult to change lane and let the behind vehicle go through? Ya our $$$ was spent on these roads... doesn't mean we have to act like we really own it. I think its better to let a few speeders through, rather than hog up a whole line of cars behind you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly... if you come here to share everyone here that you've got a new ride... you should keep an open mind to everyone's comments here.
