I mean like 90 kmh is ok for most other cars as their top speed generally around at least 180kmh like that. Won't the car feel like a bit... unsafe? Maybe not to you but how about your passengers? However, if you already test drive the car and happy that it can go at a high speed safely then I guess its ok loh...<br><br>Btw, in case you not sure, if you talking about the right most lane (ie. lane 1), during weekends especially since you are driving an OPC, then 90kmh is too slow at some expressways. Some stretches you can easily see people hitting 110kmh or more. I know its breaking the law but its a fact that others are doing it and all of us just have to live with it. And yes, if in drive closer you mean people tail gate you, then yes, there will be the WRXs, RX-8s, EVOs, Celicas etc driven by ah bengs that might do so to you.
