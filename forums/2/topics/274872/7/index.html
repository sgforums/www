            <div class='col-md body'>I think some common sense should be in place in the discussion of car to car comparison. Of course we assume the driver and the driving style are the same! I don't really quite get it about what 'ah pek in old proton vs dangerous driver in big car'.<br><br>Other than the above, yes there can be various schools of thought. Some may say at 3-digit speeds, even a 5-star safety car can't keep its occupants safe. Hence the safety aspects, in the perspective of these people, are considered redundant for the extra costs that you pay for.<br><br>However I'm from the other school that, better car build and more safety features will LOWER A DRIVER'S RISK LEVEL in an accident as compared to a more basic car, ceteris paribus (driving style, speed). Yes in accidents at mad speeds, death is inevitable. However, accidents can occur even when you're travelling as slowly as 50km/h. I'm not going to list down all the possible scenarios, anyone who drives should know what I mean. <strong>So the crux now is, even at such harmless speeds, what are the CHANCES a poorly designed car can keep its occupants safe, as compared to a more safety-reputed car?</strong><br><br>But I won't be so radical as to slam the TS, it's a lame act. I'm just trying to give my fair view on what's been argued so far. I do agree with "you pay for what you get". <strong>However there's no benchmark on how much to pay is RIGHT.</strong> It all depends on how much the consumer is willing/ready to fork out. It's just like buying unit trusts, you go for the one with the risk level you're ready for.<br><br>P.S.: Still, on a PERSONAL note, my benchmark is above China-made cars, thanks to the power of media. Even for non-savvy me, YouTube is sufficient to show me the safety standards of the PRC cars.</div>

Most of the ferrari crashes which includes death of the passenger + driver, the ferrari is driving at how many hundred miles? which car doesn't break down to pieces travelling at such speed.<br><br>Whereby do you hear news where a Ferrari is travelling at 50km/h and driver dying? of course no.<br><br>and just a comparison. let say we have 2 cars, any china car vs a japan normal sedan car.<br><br>you are travelling 50 km / h for both cars. same kind of collision, same kind of style and so on. in the china car, because of lesser safety gadgets and so on, you inflicted yourself with a physical ability and you're unable to work for the rest of your life.<br>whereas in the japan sedan car, with higher euro ncap safety ratings, you inflicted yourself with some minor injuries but yet still able to work after a few months of recovery?<br><br>You see the difference? Anyway, its my personal opinion on like how you view your cars life finanancial means, so you just can't say that safety is not really a must.<br><br>At least if you want to build or produce something, think of the consumer first before building it. And build it with passion and effort, not just some garang garang Rush the products out.</div>

NCAP is a controlled environment and should only be used as a guide. Regardless, i'm not basing everything on NCAP. I do my research and I know that for example, when mercedes tests cars for cold weather, they literally drive it from germany up north to freezing temperatures and carry out the test - so that even the route there is tested, whereas other companies choose to ship the car over and then take plane reach there and carry out tests - which may cause them to overlook safety issues in changes in temperatures from one region to another.. of course they have other tests to check this but ya.. u get my point..<br><br>it's also about track records.. take volvo.. they have a team of people who will try to investigate accidents involving their cars AFTER the car has been sold. they want to find out if there was something wrong with the car or was it driver error or was it the other vehicles fault. also looks into impact of damage etc. to improve the survivability of the car.. then they make changes and further versions of the same car will be even safer. if serious, they do an immediate recall and fix all the cars that are already on the road. so if lets say one person died after a new volvo car is released because maybe the glass was too near the driver then he hit other car the glass smash his head or something.. they dont sit back and do nothing. they fix the problem so that other drivers wont suffer the same fate.<br><br>However, i can't say the same for hafei. there is no track record, etc. what's THEIR commitment to safety?<br><br>btw, can u pple stop using ferrari as an example for safety? it's not known for a track record of safety (although it is fairly safe), it's known for producing extremely fast cars with extremely powerful engines. the price tag is for the design and the engine.</div>

I don't know why everyone keeps referring back to the driver and skill when we're talking abt the car! The driver can always be changed and skills can always be improved. the one factor that does not change is the car after u have chosen it.<br><br>example u have a blunt knife and a sharp knife. i tell u that u will never cut thru that wood with the blunt knife because it's flat and smooth, u shld use a sharp one and u tell me that even if u have a sharp knife u dunno how to cut u end up cut ur own finger blunt or sharp also no diff. -_- of cos i'm assuming that the one using the knife dont change rite and he has some reasonable skill in cutting rite and in the end its just choosing the right knife rite..</div>
