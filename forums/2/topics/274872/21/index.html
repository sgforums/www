            <div class='col-md body'>lemme give u a good eg. the dodge viper which was supposedly due to launch in SG had come to pass why? cos the car failed the LTA insp...I am very very sure that this has got NOTHING to do with safety standards...the viper at least has a 3.5-4 star NCAP crash test rating if i'm correct....so that proves my point abt the LTA passing the car mainly cos of emissions and NOT coz of safety standards....</div>

Well we cant get the best of both worlds what..<br><br>Well since the TS liked the car, so why not let him carry on liking it?
