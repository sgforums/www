As long as i dont have to feel finacially stress over cars. I am more than happy!<br><br>Personally, I think it is unwise to spend so much money on cars when you jolly well that you know you cannot afford it.<br><br>People say accident etc then die. Well thats why we call it 'accident'! Live or die, its not for us to decide.<br><br>What about financial stress that can lead to high blood pressure, sleepless night, arguements, social instability etc? Have anyone ever compared between accident and those?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><img src="http://images.inmagine.com/168nwm/liquidlibrary/vl008/vl008105.jpg"></div>
