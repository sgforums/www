            <div class='col-md body'>I am new in the "car business" too.<br><br>From what I read Kelissa should be better in terms of FC than Getz. Cause of the engine CC of the cars.<br>Guess instead of being so concern about FC here, I think you shall consider more on the price of the cars, seems to be a 5k different here.<br><br>Just a guide, if you spend S$300/month on petrol for a 15km/l car, comparing it to a 13km/l car, you will save S$5000 in 10 years.<br><br>Fuel consumption is only important when you drive a lot, for example when you work in the west and stay in the east.<br>Or when you are comparing cars of FC differences of 4 of more km/l.<br><br>Just a thought from me.<br>wbucket</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dun mind me asking: why OPC? With such low COE now, theres no point having to live with the inconveniences ............ and have you actually went for a test drive ? bcos your own feel is the best decision making tool ...........  eg. I can tell you 1001 &amp; one reasons why kelisa better than getz, but if you like Getz, my opinion will mean nothing ......... and vice versa ...............<br><br>STEPS when buying car<br><br>1. Establish Budget( And stick to it !!)<br>2. List out some requirements ( not too many hor)<br>3. Read up on fellow forumites' posting for unbiased opinions based on actual usage<br>4. go shopping<br>5. SHortlist 2 or 3, and choose which one you LIKE best.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes the coe has went down but if you compare the getz at $53888 for normal car and $36888 for OPC is cheaper. Though the time is restricted but i can go leave home at 6.30am and reach office at 7am, and work abit later which i always do and leave office at 7pm. As for testing of car, i have not do so, coz me girl mah...got power or not i also can't feel it..kekkeke as long as can move off and reach my destination is good euff already. most important must save fuel loh..but then seems like kelisa have to do alot of modding then will be very power coz after reading the forum all the fishes (kelisa) go for modding every now and then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FC really isnt an issue if you just to and fro work. I travel from Simei to Boon Lay every morning to my office and its ard 35Km so per day only 70km travelled. So in 20 working days you may travelled around 1500 km (plus your own outside or work consumption).<br><br>Thus a car which gives you 10km / litre will need 150 litres of fuel. Assuming you pump Esso/Mobil 95 which is 1.465 per litre, you would spend $219.75 per mth.<br><br>In comparison a car which say gives you 12km / litre, you would spend $183.13<br><br>In comparison a car which gives you 15km / litre (which getz and kelissa cant give you i believe), you would spend $146.50.<br><br>Kelissa and Getz's FC is close to one another I believe cos I never read up on them, thus based on yout travel consumption, FC should not be a big consideration as the savings you may achieve per mth is not that critical.  The lesser you travel, the lesser FC becomes important.<br><br>For your reference, I travel around 3000+ Km per mth on my sales job and I use to drive a KIA Sephia and my fuel every mth $400+. Now I drive a Honda City Vtec, I spend less than $300 per mth. So with over $100 in savings per mth, FC should then be a critical factor.</div>

Which one every day you see liao will fall in love with it. A car that you are proud to show to your family and frens. A car that you can handle well. A car you think can fit your needs.  As I said, in your case, FC may not be such a big consideration.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you want an OPC, there are many choice around. Kelisa and Getz are very basic low end cars.<br><br>Kelisa cabin is very small and crampy, although it has a rev willing engine. If you are looking for space and comfort, its out.<br><br>Gtez- Better space layout but the plastic used for the dash is terrible. The dials and knobs is so filmsy and poor quality. It reminds me of my niece toy radio knobs. Engine is so so and FC is better than Matrix. Exterior looks good, especially the 3 door model.<br><br>Go try the Vios, City, Jazz. It cost a bit more but they are better made, a class higher and gives you much more comfort and 'shiokness'. Hey you are going for OPC, so last thing you want is look forward to driving a car that is crampy, lousy plastic and noisy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got to disagree here 'cos the Getz build quality is actually pretty good with tactile feel throughout and the car's remarkably quiet for its class. In fact refinement its comparable to a Corolla only slightly corase. FC may not be class leading 'cos it has an immensly heavy body and the pick up maynot be brisk. I dun think Getz is in the same class as the Vios, City/Jazz 'cos of the price differentiation.</div>
