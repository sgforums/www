FC depending on ur right foot. nice clean look.... if u are not really a speed junkie and wants to drive a coupe with enough practicality, rx8 is definitely the choice for u in its price range. if u are a speed demon and 0 to 100 km/h timings are a priority for u, then maybe the EVO or subaru WRX STI are better choice.<br>if not maybe u can wait abit longer for the new S2000 coming i think. </div></blockquote>new s2000 is out, its 2.2l but only PI brings in, kah is still using the 2l block. if u interested in the 6speed JDM 250hp i have a PI friend that can link u up. this car was also under my consideration when i was about to change car,in the end went for the other choice.rx8 good car,a pity no TC version yet</div>
