            <div class='col-md body'>lets be frank. F1 is out of the question. But JGTC and some other lower formula series might be good. The point is, how much of the motorsport business market will it create and/or open up? I was in oxford yesterday, and I spoke to this guy who ran a few of his own businesses, and had some connections with the singapore sports council and the Garage R people. He's at LSE doing Politics. And his frank opinion was that even with this track in sg, business-wise, it's not going to open up anytime soon, UNLESS the govt puts in full effort in backing sg motorsports. So to what extent will it allow one to set up a business in sg motorsports and be able to survive and profit, it remains to be seen.</div>

All we need it to bring in the crowd and the infra structure. In term of transportation and hotels, we already have it. All we need is the race track. What the government is planning right now, is only a 3km track, but I believe it is very easy for them to extent this track by another 2 to 3 km. All they need to do is to have a half circuit and half street track in Tuas.<br><br>Personally I dont see Cancun, Moscow and Delhi as a threat because they are targeting at different market and crowd. Tilke's tracks boring? That is subjective lah, and if it is really that boring, honestly I dont see why he is always being offer the job.</div>

However, they are already in talks with Bernie Ecclestone (Poison Dwarf). Potentially some of the European races will make way (Hungary, France, NÃ¼rburgring, maybe Spain too) as the teams would be unwilling to participate in more than 18/19 races a year.

(What is the cost of constructing a race track compare to the $600,000,000 construction cost on the esplanade?)<br><br></div></blockquote>But Sg govt must see themselves getting something out of it, because it's not so much throwing away money they dislike, rather it's throwing away money for no visible gain that they can see that they dislike.
