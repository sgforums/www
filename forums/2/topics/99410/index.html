Their cost is 2k above paper value w/ average 3500k depreciation. The average cost will be around 24k unless u are talking abt the 1 dollar COE.

I am planning to buy one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>For the Rx-7, no doubt it's cheap now. Everyone can afford a Rx-7 (in a sense just buy the car), but not everyone can afford the ridicules fuel consumption of 300km per full tank of 90 dollars. Further more very little shops in singapore and malaysia know how to repair rotary engine. Their spare parts are too expensive.</div>

I am a very realistic person. I am just stating the facts.

            <div class='col-md body'>tks. furthermore you enjoy lower insurance premiums for parf cars than coe cars. another point to note is that (general rule, not taking into a/c well maintained coe cars) coe cars tend to have more mechanical problems due to wear n tear on the roads. if you factor these facts wif the higher road tax u got to pay, u are better off wif a second hand parf car (by the way i'm 100% no dealer ok, just a consumer <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> )<br><br>or if you want to enjoy free waranty n the brand new image, get a new car. parf cars b4 2002 enjoy higher rebates, so if u r looking to reduce ur risk, look for one between 98-02.<br><br>cheers</div>

That means ur bought ur current car at 17k, meaning only left 2-3 years of coe rite?<br><br>in that case, when the current coe expires, then say u get a $23k coe for renewal, therefore ur total amount u have paid is $40k - allowing u drive for say 13 years as compare to coe car renewed with 08/2011 coe expiry - abt 7 yrs left at which dealer selling at $23k. (that's my current drive  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> )<br><br>In terms of accident coverage, of course B is much better. What i am looking at is the period that can drive the car at minimal cost. yup, maintenance wise, of course coe car is higher - higher risk here at lower paid up car price. juz my 10cent opinion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz remember dealer's mark up the price  (e.g COE $22k, car selling for $28k) for the body, but insurance company may not recognise that as the market value.<br><br>Let's say you bought Third Party + Fire/Theft, and ur car got stolen or burnt to a crisp, I doubt the insurance will pay much or anything for the body. (Esp. if u spent money modding it, they dun recognise ur mods). So effectively, u are only getting ur COE rebate back. (Sian, mite as well dun buy insurance...if only...heh)<br><br>So renewed COE cars are a bit 'risky' in terms of their value and for insurance purposes.

            <div class='col-md body'>I bought my Subaru M80 viki some months ago. Yearly is about 2500. I finally come to my sense, car is just a transport. In Singapore, its not worth to spend so much on it since price of ownership is high. After changing a few cars, i decided to save $ for other uses, so its comes to a conclusion the Viki.<br><br>Buying COE car, you have to consider the yearly addition of 10% road tax til max 150%. If your car is small, it can be negligible. If you are driving car like 1.6L, you will be end up paying alot  alot more. So why not consider Parf car or new car then.<br><br>For my car, i have calculated the risk of loss. To get even, i have one year to do that. As i am paying 3 years of loan for a 7 year car. This is to get debt free as soon as possible. Also i pay less interest on my car. So After one year if anything serious happen to my car, i would have break even. And after that i may even have some cash back after scrapping the car. So it really depends on the type of car, road tax, loan interest, insurance and current market and COE to determine what car is economic to buy. In addition, it should suit your taste. Doesnt have to be a COE car or a Parf car.</div>
