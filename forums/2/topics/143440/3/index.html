            <div class='col-md body'>=/ i juz had my first accident. hit a malaysian motorcyclist on the BKE towards Johor just before the dairy farm exit. Hit him from behind. Jammed the brakes but they simply locked and the car skidded forward n hit him. mind went blank and i didn't really know how to react.. he flew off his motorcycle and i'm damned traumatised. I'm a little jittery now when driving is there any way to regain self-confidence in driving i'm freaking scared of motorbikes etc. now.. helpx.. scared of a second accident luckily nobody died and he said he didn't want any investigation etc. not even an ambulance.. perhaps cause he's malaysian.. (a police car came within 5 mins but nobody i saw called the police leh) thanks to the Jurong police or i would not have known what to do i'm just 18.. I'm still quite stunned. =/</div>

So now I use other roads.<br><br>However, painful it might be but it serve as an experience on brakes and speed. Now you wish you have had ABS. Many have told me (after mine incident, just another car) that brakes cannot be jam like that, confirm lock and ski!! Anyway, do be aware of the surrounding and drive like all other road users are idiots that would do anything. Be prepared, be safe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah now I know but seriously before this I have never felt wheels locking before cause i gently brake to a stop usually.. anyhow tried to repeat the same form of braking cause I switched the ignition on today and saw all the test lights.. there was ABS light.. but yet the wheels still lock.. i repeated the jam braking in a huge car park and on the main road when the lights turned red with no cars behind.. from 80km/h jam brakes to 0 km/h. somehow i'm not convinced it was wheels locking.. can anyone explain the concept of brake &gt; wheels locking as well as ABS? the ABS light did not come on. description of what I felt: felt like gears being unable to connect like the grooves can't catch each other and its basically metal against metal.. or something like that.. if dun understand can come sit in my car i brake then u explain to mi. =/ i realli wanna brake properly and safely.. stopping in the shortest distance possible.. how? anyway it's an automatic mitsubishi space wagon chariot</div>
