In the circuit, you have all the poles to guide you and everything seems to be standard. When you are out on your own, you have nothing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  I always wonder what is the point of providing poles to guide students to park when there aren't any out there? Seems like students are back to square one when they graduate.<br><br>Conclusion: Schools should remove the poles and let students learn the hard way.

Having them around when driving is like having the tester/instructor beside you, STRESS!!! My bro also commented about my driving, but in return I asked him to drive and I observe his techni. He sure drive much much better than me, in fact he drive the best comparing the number of friends (including my dad) that I asked to test-drive my car, in hope of learning the best way to drive.<br><br>I mount kerb, scratch rims, kiss lancer, stall engine (lose count), gear mis-alignment (terrible sound) til now (6 months driving), but each time I learn and improve and soon you will gain that confidence. Best senario is to drive your own car or alone. Don't take the fun out of driving!!!<br><br>Note: I still need people to guide me when doing parallel parking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Sometime it is good to give 1 or 2 pointers, but too much of those make the driver sick. Basically it is how the advice is given and received, the delicate balance would easily be distrubed.</div>

At least my brother just laughed till I saw bits of tears accumulate at the corners of his eyes - it was one of my earlier attempts at parallel parking and the back wheel of my car kept hitting the kerb  .<br><br>One other time, a nice young man even offered to park my car for me, probably because he didn't want to have to be stuck for 10 minutes watching some girl try to get into a parking lot and then start to cry as more guys pooled around to watch the freak show.<br><br>And my bf then? He kept screaming beside me ... "Hey, slow down!" ... "Watch the gears" ... " You're too close on the left" ... "Watch out for that car!" ... "Cyclist!" ... "Brake now!" ... "Quick! No cars now, go on to the next lane" ...  "Signal now (like two turnings ahead!)" ... "Where's my car?" ...

In the circuit, you have all the poles to guide you and everything seems to be standard. When you are out on your own, you have nothing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  I always wonder what is the point of providing poles to guide students to park when there aren't any out there? Seems like students are back to square one when they graduate.<br><br>Conclusion: Schools should remove the poles and let students learn the hard way. Will be better for the longer run don't you think so?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>learning to park with poles actually provides learners with a good foundation on judging the distance and turns while parking. Yes, there is certainly a difference when it comes to parking in real life and dat surely haf to come from experience. My advice to you is to get used to ur car dimensions, learn to 'memorise' at which pt you shd start to turn when parkng. You gotta find a day, go to the car park, and preferably wif an experienced driver to try it out.<br><br>Frankly speaking, alot of ppl haf problems wif parallel parking or even normal parking. Im not saying my parallel parking is good. But definitely it's better den those ppl who haf to go in and out 3 - 4 times before getting into the slot. And the reason why i can parallel park..I still apply wat i've learnt from the driving sch 2 yrs ago. and it works well</div>
