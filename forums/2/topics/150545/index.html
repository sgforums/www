            <div class='col-md body'>Just take a look at the COE price at that time. 24k. Quite a big difference from now therefore the price. If I am not wrong, 03/04 Vios' price was almost similar to the corolla altis' price currently. Just browse through the classads or sgcarmart and look for some 01 or 02 corollas which are already selling for 40 odd k when brand new corolla altis only 60k. Therefore, IMHO it makes no sense to buy second hand although some may say otherwise due to parf and all that crap.</div>

Anyway, if ppl offer you 46K, dont wait liao. I heard from some dealer in Oct, LTA will release the number of COE for next year and mostly it will be much more due to the high number of car being scrap this year and COE might drop further. If drop 5K then your selling price will be the same as the new car liao.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes if someone offers you 46k and if you must sell, you better do it now. The oil prices keep raising. People are being put off by the high running cost of maintaining a car. So couple that more cars being scrap, less car being purchase I think if 46k to you is a good offer, its best u get rid of it now. Buying a car is a commitment and calculated risk that we all undertake when we sign on the dotted line. That is to say when you buy a car, you actually AGREED to be exposed to such situations. Don't blame anybody. The next car that comes along the way you will face the same problem when you want to sell. Like it or not, this is the way the market is; Supply and Demand...<br><br>No point claiming you paid high COE for your car and thus your car have a higher Scrap Value. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the simple fact that no one buy cars for the sake of scrapping</span> what's the point of telling pple your car have a high PARF? Although high Parf buffers the owner in terms of financial losses but that will only apply in the worst case possible such as Fire, Theft or even simply; Lang-ga. Why? I buy car from you I have to pray I kana all these so that the high COE can helped save my wallet isit? Aren't that make me a joker?<br><br>*** No offense to you I hoped. I was quoted 43k for my 05/03 City. If I do sell, I lose 30k over a period of 2years and 4mths. Plus the high fuel price now, that is what had been holding me back on my next purchase. I can go around boasting about my 27K COE which caused me to pay 72k for my car initially (and claiming high PARF value) but no one will actually care cos a new City is only 59k now. Its the mthly liability and the mthly running cost that interest people when they buy a car; not the scrap value. It's dollars and cents. Simple as that...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yea I have to agree that since you are being offered 46k then what is really holding you back man? No offence but for 46k, I might as well buy brand new. You might want to count yourself lucky getting such a price IMHO. For my case, we bought an early 03 cefiro at 100 odd k at that point of time and just recently, I went car hunting due to the tempting prices and was only offered 53k for it. Almost half the value gone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Even worse was the previous car which was a 99 Accord bought at 140 odd k and when we traded it in, offered only 60k.

So maybe you should get used car if you intend t change after 3 yrs.<br><br>If you buy new car, your SE will be able to help you sell your car and use your parf rebates for the new one.<br><br>If you want to buy used car, can try advertising to sell your parf paper at about 3-5% discount. Since your parf rebate is so high, you could well save over 2k. If you can find a buyer, just sell your car body to dealers for export and tell then you want to keep the parf paper. They can also advise you on how to transfer the paper. Can look up www.onemotoring.com.sg for the procedure too. its actually not that difficult.<br><br>I'm actually in the same shoe as you cos my car is also coming to 5yrs in Dec. As I usually try to keep the car for 10 yrs, I find that my annual depreciation is the same even if I get a new car of my choice. So, the obvious choice is for me to get a new car.</div>
