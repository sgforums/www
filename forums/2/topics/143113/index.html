Malaysian it might be, but within lies a Japan heart (engine). So even if all the parts fall off, the engine will still run!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, I would get Picanto (M) over Getz 1.3 anytime.

So no excuse that ladies can't drive manual cars.</div>

Do visit <a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/Kelisa/start" rel="nofollow">SG kelisa club</a> and <a href="http://www.metroperdana.net/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=Stage-02" rel="nofollow">My Kelisa club</a> for the things people do to their kelisa. Or if you are not in a hurry, we have a meet-up this 31th july. Can come down and have a look. Bring your wife, she will think the car is cute too.<br><br>Otherwise, Picanto can look manly too, when it is black and have a nice set of sport rims. But do note that Picanto(A)'s FC seems to be un-desirable compared to Kelisa(A) due to the heavy foot when you doesn't feel the strenght of the car.</div>

However I have know many who langa and live to tell about it. Anyway, there are those who think the same for Picanto or in fact most small cars. So it depends on you. Get you want you are comfortable with, but don't think that you are driving a TANK.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
