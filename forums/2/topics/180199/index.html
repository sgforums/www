In this way, it is telling the involved party that you know your stuff and dun play punk with you.<br><br>Or best, get a copy of accident report form from idac and put inside the car for just in case.

(as he can fight back statement as ur making illegal U-turn), but if it was a LEGAL u-turn, and he didn't brake on time and smashed into u... juz claim under him, of course we have to practise considerate driving as to brake early and signal to let driver behind us know that we are slowing down and our next move, if it was a legal u-turn and say if ur an inconsiderate driver, suddenly jam brake and make a u-turn and if a car hit ur behind, guess what ... it's his fault. friend was in this situation before.<br><br>simply because the cab driver didn't keep a safe distance, the cabbie insist he keep a very safe distance but my fren jam brake to sudden... my frend replied, do u know what's the meaning of "keep a distance" ?? it is at any point of time, when the guy in front of u jam brake could be due to sudden hazard or like his an inconsiderate one who jam brake only for a turn, he should always have stop on time, if he can't ... it's obvious his "keeping a safe" distance isn't safe enuff as he can't react to such ... thus, my frnd claim all under his insurance, even get a car replacement for the days when the car is in the workshop ......<br><br>no doubt this is more like a case of inconsiderate driver but moral of the story is, try avoid accident, even if u can't avoid one, pray that it's somebody else who hit ur back, not ur the one ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
