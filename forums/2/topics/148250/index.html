            <div class='col-md body'>I have scratches and swirl marks on my 4mth old black Honda Odyssey after 2 visits. I used to own a red Hyundai Trajet(5 yrs old) and the polishing was okay. When I got my new car, they allowed for me to transfer the membership to the new car on an earlier agreement I had with them.A few months ago, I sent the new car in  for the $80 package which includes a sealant. After the polish, I was conned into extending another 2yrs paying the same I paid the 1st time for a year(abt $350), which at that time looks like a good deal. About a month ago, I sent the car to Century Sq branch for another polish, this time only $48 waxing(no sealant).  With all the recent downpours, the polish did not seemed to last at all. And the scratches and swirl marks became so obivous. I am now convinced that they do not do a good job and will probably not send my car there for another slaughter. Any one have similar experiences that they like to share?</div>

I think either they din do a good job(not skilful?) or the wax they use is no good that's why they caused all those scratches and swirl marks.<br><br>I jus went to a car grooming shop. Their service not bad. I post my review in my topic 'yippee...I got my  1st new car! It's a mitsubishi colt'. I give you their number if u are interested. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the thought <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> . I have resorted to DIY. Did it on monday and looks a whole lot better now. Guess it's something I have to live with owning a black car. And thanks for the reply.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
