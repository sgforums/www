              The PIE from the Tuas area back to Toa Payoh area is getting more and more unsafe recently after 9.45pm. Just tonight I met the worse. There was this extremly slow space wagon in front of me on lane 1. I presume he his family in the car since he had installed those car TV usually watched by kids which were switched on. As this guy left a giant gap in front of his car and I had already followed him for some time, I decided to overtake him. When I signal and went to lane 2, he picked up his speed. Want to drive slow but don't want to let others in front of him...... I've overtook him since I was using a manual. We were nearing Toa Payoh already by that time.
              
              Imagine my surprise when he started flashing me non-stop for almost 1 minute. When I did not bother,he stopped but tailed gated me very closely. And here comes the best part, my exit at Upper Serangoon was coming up so I've filtered out. There was another lane to Toa Payoh on my left. And a bus in front of me. That idiot somehow wanted to race me with kids in his car and followed me out. When he realised that I was exiting and that he could not race me anymore, he actually tried to force my car into the left lane which was the wrong exit for me (even when he was supposed to go straight on the PIE).
              
              This would have put me in danger of an accident so I refused to budge and whack my horn. He then swerve out at the last minute back into the PIE suddenly putting the other cars in danger.
              
              Seriously what a jerk and inresponsible father. Think they got some $$$ to install TV monitors in their car then they own the road! And driving like to and putting his whole family together with his kids in danger. 
              
              Frankly speaking, I wouldn't have bothered to stop if that idiot flip his car trying to ram.
              He wants to die with his whole family, go ahead. I still want to take care of my wife.
              As the Dark Knight said, I don't kill people but that doesn't mean I have to save you.

              <p>Tat's why these days all sorts of drivers on the road.</p>
              <p>Lane 1 is only for overtaking or unless there's no cars behind you. It's a simple courtesy to stay on lane 2.</p>
              <p>Sometimes practice safe driving, say you're exiting alrdy just form up early though it just takes a few more seconds.</p>
              <p>Never ever get into 'racing' type of situation, you're only endangering others. Esp since in this case there's a slower moving bus, both hits it those passengers standing will trip and fall badly. Sometimes just let the felllow pass.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I'm thinking tat's why there's maniac driving these days knowing TP only bothers to catch for speeding.</p>
