That is subjective....Buying one in Singapore now versus say even a year ago might be **cheaper**. But when you compare with other countries, our cars are still ridiculously expensive!! And then what about the higher petrol price, higher ERP, and higher everything else? You might same a bit upfront, but lose a lot more in the long run.....</div>
