              <p>Seriously, i have encountered so many time where drivers are coming out of a slip road and just merging with the main road by driving through the island. whats wrong with just waiting in the line? there is an major accident about the happen.</p>
              <p>today i just encountered a situation whereby im coming down cte on the first lane, just going the bridge to exit at amk ave1. and the merging lane is from barddell road.. and there are the two white lines which indicate they are only to join the cte after it. so this guy comes right into my lane squeezing inbetween me and the car infront. so i flashed him a few times to warn him that i'm right behind. Therefore to show me his anger, he just slams on his brake? that would have caused a serious accident, and may even hurt someone. how acceptable is this? i'm just drives me absolutely mad</p>

              <p>Quite the same thing happened to me yesterday. I was making my way to TPE from sengkang. The slip road that merges with the expressway has two lanes that merges into one lane closer to the expressway. I was on the left side, there's this Civic behind me on the right side.</p>
              <p>From my rearview mirror I know he wanted to overtake me, maybe he can't stand getting stuck behind a red-plate Picanto. At the point where he tried to overtake me the two lanes are nearly merged into one lane already. I even shifted my car to the right a little to try and block that little bastard, yet he squeezed passed me and we were so close to clipping each other's car. My blood was boiling like mad at that point so I horned and flashed high beam.</p>

              <p>It's not a problem to travel at 100km/h indicated on your speedo. Because we all know our speedos are never accurate. So 100km/h indicated on the speedo is probably just 93-95km/h in reality. So exceeding the speed limit by 3-5km/h, I doubt the TP so bo liao fine you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I'm a young man I agree, but that's not why my blood boiled. My blood boiled because the two lanes are about to become one lane already he still drove on the road shoulder and overtook me. For what? Just to be in front of me?</p>
              <p>If he tried to overtake me earlier when there's still lots of space I won't have been pissed off.
