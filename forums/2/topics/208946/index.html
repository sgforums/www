            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Gavinsg,<br><br>Sorry to hear about your plight.<br><br>I'm not sure if the insurance companies will pay in full or not.  To speed up the payment process, you will maybe have to "encourage" the investigating police officer to close the case by declaring that the car cannot be found.<br><br>May I ask, please.....<br><br>- What brand/model/year was your car?<br><br>- Did you have any immobilisers or locks?  If so, what type?<br><br>- Roughly how was the car stolen?  You just parked it, came back and it wasn't there?<br><br>- Where in Desaru was the car stolen?<br><br></div>

Be prepared to go to the Malaysia police station a few times to sort out paper work. you will need to sit out at least 6-8 weeks for the insureance co. to `finish' the investigation.<br>2. get the name of the investigating officer with you from the malaysia police. he will be your point of contact. pester them, otherwise they will take their sweet time.<br><br>for me, i only got 70% of my car value back. it took about 4months in total. the best part is the insurance company will `own' your car including the COE. it will be sold to the highest bidder over the internet. your car plate also gone. LTA will not allow u to register the new car in your old plate. siad due to theft, they may mistake u for the thief if they see the car.<br><br>it's a hassle, but it's too bad. good luck!<br></div>
