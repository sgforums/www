            <div class='col-md body'>I got my new Latio on Tues. There are certain things that really impressed me.<br><br>1) keyless entry is something new. Convenient needless to say. I don't have to even remove the key from my pocket throughout the entire day<br><br>2) The newly improved CVT engine is fuel economical and very smooth and quiet. You can even feel the engine braking when you are coming to an halt. Commendable for an auto car<br><br>3) Spacious in the inside, by making use of a more compact engine compartment<br><br>4) However, it's still considered a chep car, hence dun be surprised to see cheap plastics and ugly lights in the interior. The reading lights look like some modificaion bought from Autobac lor<br><br>5) On the whole, it's value for $$, relatively better performance as compared to sunny and a smoother ride.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well ...<br><br>Need to compare up to the details.<br><br>Price of Latio Now $74 to 76 after 1000 discount (Finance)<br>Price of Civic Vti-L $75 after Discount (Finance too)<br><br>Power of Latio at a Glance @ 109ps<br>Power of Civic Vti-L at a Glance @ 110ps<br><br>For a 1.5L car, the power is quite close to Civic VTI-L. This is a simple conclusion that Latio Engine is pretty good.<br><br>Additional to note that Latio FC heard so far is around 13km/l to 15km/l, which I think if I am not wrong much better than civic.<br><br>Interior and Package<br><br>Latio defaults gives the leather/Alcantara which is of better quality than Honda<br>Latio Keyless entry is unique to Latio in this class range of cars (American Design)<br>Interior Dashboard is of European design which gives u a classy and cosy feel (for me for sure) as compare to an outdated Civic dashboad design (Since SDx range of Civic ?? - Only Speedometer changes)<br><br>Clever design of Interior space (Guess Renault plays a big part). Being a shorter car than Civic, the interior space is almost similar to Civic.<br><br>Safety feature -<br>Active Headrest - to prevent Whiplash Injuries during collision - Civic had none<br>Brake Assist - Latio / Altis have it ... not too sure Civic have it or not, but from what I know - None<br>Large Pockets of storage space, large glovebox which cant find in Civic (Depends on individual - I like to have more storage space)<br>PlasmasCluster ION - fresher air<br><br>For 2k more ... Latio gives a much better quality, more feature packed car than Civic - which I feel the features and such are basic of a car. Closer to lancer than to Latio/Altis<br><br>Take a closer look and u will know why.<br><br>My choice is Latio (I had initially put Altis, Latio and Civic as part of my choice)<br><br>But that is only a simple comparison. The liking still up to individual. Some still prefer the basic of Civic.</div>
