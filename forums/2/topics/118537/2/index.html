            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Guys<br><br>I am one of the first owners of a Harvest Yellow Nissan lation Sport. Got it 3 weeks ago. I am going in for a check up tomorrow <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> .<br><br>WHY?<br><br>Because damn it, for the first full tank, I clocked ONLY 320km. The second full tank only could get me 370km! That's ridiculous! Divide that by 45 litres (Nissan Latio is a 45 litres car) and you get 1litre=7.1km! This is not acceptable for any new car.<br><br>I made alot of noise today and Nissan is seriously looking into my case which can potentially turn into a PR crisis for Nissan. Nobody wants to buy any new car with such BAD fuel consumption.<br><br>I am very sure something is wrong. Apparently, Nissan Latio owners managed to clock 1litre=14km. Anyone done that?<br><br>Paul</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>eek .. hopefully when I got mine, it wouldnt happen this way.<br><br>I brought it because it has good FC too ... seriously got a problem.<br><br>I dont swear by honda or any cars. I keep my option open to any car manufacturer that offer a car that suits my requirement.

            <div class='col-md body'>Pls find out more from Nissan. They are quite concerned with mine as it poses one of the BIGEEST design problem or PR nightmare for them if it is really happening that way. They told me to watch the petrol guy and make sure it is so full you actually see it.<br><br>So I am doing that for this new full tank. It fills up to 40 litres (there's always an additional of 5.5 litres in car even after it hits EMPTY).<br><br>So, cross my fingers.....if it doesn't work out by the time I empty my tank....I am blowing this up till they change a new one for me. Watch out for your full tank.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pardon me for saying that i think they WONT and CANT let you change to a NEW Latio. Think abt wat needs to be changed in the vehicle LOG card and ur COE paper. Engine and chasis number is all written on them. How to change??<br><br>Buying a car still largely depends on Luck!<br><br>You might one to argue with TC on a basis against your milleage when you first got ur ride- this might give you a clue if the  first few Km of the new car life has underwent  a "hard run in" by who ever handled the car.<br><br>This obviously has smethig to do wif fual consumption in the later part of its life.<br><br>Gd luck to ur investigation. Hope you can find the prob to it soon.</div>

I purposely drive a few rounds near my home (even I already reach home) just to enjoy the audio ... well, just own it for a few days mah.<br><br>Look is BEAUTIFUL, my wife love the color she chose. Only thing not use to it, I <span style="color: red;">can't see the front part of the car from the driver seat</span>, thus I cannot estimate parking head-in (I cannot tell whether side of the car touches the pillar or not).  I used to drive a cheaper car and I always park head-forward because I can see the front part of the car from the driver seat.

            <div class='col-md body'>and take note that the best FC will show up after your 2nd servicing at 5000km t 10000km. Let the car fully run-in. Intelligent cars especially if it has some genes inherited from Renault has an ECU that memorises your driving pattern and will engage a gear to optimise FC. So watch that right foot and after a couple of tanks, you'll find the FC improve. If you're still uncertain, send it into the workshop and get the CO level tested, etc to give you peace of mind.cheers<br>Stephen <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
