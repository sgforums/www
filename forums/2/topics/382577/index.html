              <p>hello, i accidentally beat a red light today in balestier at a pedestrian crossing. nobody was injured. and i'm still on P-plate. a car behind me took a photo of the p plate and my number plate but i doubt they captured my face because my windows are tinted. </p>

              <p>Are you sure it's not the camera flash that caught you?</p>
              <p>anyway, with the number plate, the police can already trace who the driver was.</p>
              <p>btw.. why did you beat the red light? in a rush or just din react fast enough?</p>

              <p>i was looking at the next traffic junction too and it was green so i just went and i saw the red light too late. sigh. no it wasnt a red-camera zone so im sure i wasnt caught by a traffic police camera. i saw the driver behind me taking a shot through my rear view mirror. </p>
              <p>the car is registered under my mother's name so technically the police cannot track me right? but even if they did i wonder if i can appeal because i dont think the driver behind me would have taken a shot of me actually crossing past the red light. he only took a photo at the next junction. so i wonder if i still stand a chance.</p>

              <p>You sure its not camera zone ar?? Then as long as not the official LTA camera that catches you then its alright. Cause they will be able to trace back and identify you or your mum.</p>
              <p>Regarding that bugger that took your photo, since you said that he did not take the photo of your beating the red light (as in your car just crossing the stop line and at the same time the showing the red light), then I dont think you have to worry cause even if he submit to LTA, there is no case to fight since it does not show you beating the red light at all.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, you can try looking up the pictures in STOMP since people like to take photos of people breaking traffic rules and post on stomp. Some people just think they drink very good and go around taking photos of other motorist driving too slow/fast, driving without signaling or cutting lane. These people just take photos because they cannot accept the fact that people drive better than them.</p>
              <p>Anyway, good luck to you, i seriously hope nothing will happen to you as you are on probation and you only have 12 points. Beating one red light and getting caught is 12 demerit points and you can say bye bye to your license. You will also have to wait 2 years again to go for another TP test (if i am not wrong).</p>

              <p>I do agree that that people in stomp are irritating at times. But you are trying to say that driving without signaling or cutting lane is "driving better" than others? I think unfortunately that is the mentality that sets singaporean drivers apart from others. The mentality that I must cut in front of other people so that I am better than them. The mentality that if  I signal, they will not let me in which means I am not not better than them. TS has just beaten a red light. Whether he meant to do it or not, that is one issue but the fact is that he beat a red light and you are trying to tell him that the person who took a photo is a loser who goes around taking photos of people?</p>
