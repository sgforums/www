What some people fail to realize is that more often than not, a Subaru WRX or similar four wheel drive sedans will not get a perfect launch and furthermore they are not competitive with other established sports coupes when it comes to straight line sprints (not just 0-100 km/h, which is more a measure of mechanical traction at launch than a true measure of a vehicle's acceleration). This is because of several variables -<br><br>1. There is a large amount of mechanical traction from the all wheel drive system in which is equipped in the STi. When in standard 50/50 split it is very difficult to break traction on dry tarmac, especailly that of in Singapore as they are generally very smooth surfaces. Large 225mm width tires equipped on the STi, which help provide higher cornering limits, further contribute to this launching 'problem', This is why often STis or GT4 Celicas of stock form or light-tune are clocked quicker sprint times on light gravel surfaces or in slightly damp conditions where there is a slicker surface in which the tires can spin and gain static momentum, albeit for a very short period, before direct acceleration. A relatively powerful two wheel drive vehicle, such as the SL500, will not have as much a problem of 'bogging down' on dry tarmac as there is less mechanical grip as 302 bhp is diverted directly to the rear two wheels.<br><br>2. Driveline drag - This is inherent in an AWD system as is present in the STi in this case. It is not present in a variable torque split system such as is present in the Attessa-4 of the Skyline GT-R, which is in standard non-slip form sending power directly to the rear wheels only, albeit it still suffers from the weight compromises of a four wheel drive system. This driveline drag is what blunts acceleration in theses road-going rally car specials like the STi and Evo 8/9 at higher speeds (*ie. above 160 km/h) and is a contributing factor to why a regular Subaru WRX 'bug eye' GD8 is marginally slower from 0-160 km/h than a Renault Clio Sport.<br><br>3. Aerodynamics - The WRX STi is inherently a sedan that has been made into a rally racecar (WRC) or in road-going form a high-performance sports sedan. Because of the fact that it is 'shaped' for rallying (ie. extended wheel arches to provide a wider track, front splitter/ rear spoiler to provide downforce and negate any negative lift) it is not have a low drag coefficent. This is accentuated by the fact that it is a four dour vehicle, not a two door roadster/ sportscar as the SL500 and moreso the F355 are. This further contributes to its limited straight-line performance, stock or lightly modified, at higher speeds, and this is where the SL500 will edge forward and the F355 blow away the STi. These two performance vehicles are known to have some of the lowest drag coefficients (0.29 for the SL500, 0.32 for the F355 and 0.34 for the Sti, which has a much larger frontal area and hence more aerodynamic drag still)  (the F355 with an underbody designed to generate downforce at high speed and as such does without exterior parts that would add drag performing the same function) and small frontal area which contribute to a strong acceleration at higher speeds, in this case even above 100 km/h the STi will not have any advantage in acceleration in any circumstances.<br><br>Furthermore, the SL500 is generally very underestimated. German horses are generally known to be 'stronger' than Japanese ones and as such the 302 bhp claimed by Daimler Chrsyler is most likely a conservative figure, especially considering the high torque output of the engine. The F355, on the other hand, has got a 375 bhp V8, which would definetly see off all but the most highly tuned WRX STis in a straight line sprint.</div>
