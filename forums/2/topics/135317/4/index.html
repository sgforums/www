            <div class='col-md body'>Koneigsegg took the crown for the king of fastest speed early this year only. However, I personally feel that the more refined beast would be the Mac Laren F1 LM.<br>Although secondary in top speed, it has much better lap times, handling, faster acceleration and style. And you are talking about the 1995 Mac Laren and the 2005 newly launched super car. 10 yrs difference!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, back to topic....<br><br>I wonder why such @$$ like you like to show off so much. A high performance modified japanese car will be able to win you.<br>You will meet that day and tarnish the image of Merc, or rather your poor driving skills.<br><br>Evo 8 VFQ400 can catch up with a Lambo.
