            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. how about skyline gtrs? Always wondered whether that 2.6l inline-6 twin turbo can take on the continental's v8 engines.. But then bhp aside, cant relli compare jap cars wif continental ones, even when toking bout the evos, rexes or skylines.. continental has that luxury and refine element to it whereas jap sports cars are more geared towards a simple yet aggressive aspect So to each his own lorz.. if u like it real fast minus luxury, den jap is theway to go, but if u wan a beast couple wif luxury and prestige, den continental is the way to go lorz..</div>

A mere 190km/h and it's pushing your pea-sized up your skull, are the poorly setup shocks from mercs screwing up your brain-hand coordination or the driver simply doesn't do justice to the car? I wonder if it's a case of smudging pride or dirt on your car. You sound like the perfect analogy to represent a low-life operating a luxury equipment.<br><br>Subaru make-over sports? I can't think of any driver who's driving a SL500 but couldn't even make out the model of a car. This shows how superficial you are. Whatever the case, it's probably an incident of manufacturing defect from what you cited, I believe it happens to your honour-deemed continental cars as well. Why not we take this to the track rather than doing just the talking over a virtual concept, you probably don't own a SL at the end of the day.<br><br>I'll show you what jap cars are made of. You wanna smell rubber? I have lots of them for you. A stock to stock race, what say you? I don't even have to bring out my apple-stuffing pipes to completely own you, doing that will only force me to rear-end you on the lapping.<br><br>You really think Evos can't beat the shit out of you? I will knock off your bumper for you.</div>
