            <div class='col-md body'>http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=147997&amp;page=1<br><br>Read the above thread.  My detailed reply.<br><br>It amazes me how much irrelevant posts and wrong information are made in this thread.<br><br>First of all, the "normal" WRX and the STi sold by Motor Image Exterprise are all UK spec, 225PS and 265Ps respectively. Of course, there are other variants like the Japan Domestic Market STis and the top of the range STi Type RA Spec Cs.<br><br>225PS models are a dime in a dozen on the road, due to the affordable price of $92k now with COE. They come standard with a 1994cc engine. Standard 5 speeder box with open differentials (no LSD) with a final drive of 3.9. Black colour seats. Lower air scoop in front when compared to STi (BTW, most of them opt for the higher STi one). 4 pot brakes...either the black one (Pre 2005 models) or red ones (post 2005). Diameter of front rotors are 243mm, STi is 294mm and running standard Brembo 4 pot calipers. No wipers at rear windscreen. Has the AWD sticker at rear. Boot has big subaru wording across. Hidden radio antenna. No climate control aircon. TD04 small turbo. Max boost is 0.8 bar. Dual tip exhaust. 2.75 turns lock to lock on steering. 3 cat convertors. Up-pipe has one.<br><br>265PS models are also a dime in a dozen. $120+k with COE. 1994cc engines with much strengthened internals. Molydenum top crown coated pistons. A more dynamically balanced engine. 6 Speed gearbox with Suretrac 1.5 way LSD. final drive at 3.9 too. Higher air scoop. Blue and black seats with STi words embroidedon front seats. Brembo brakes, gold colour, 4 pot front, 2 pot rear. Bigger drive shafts to take the abuse. Same AWD sticker at rear. No wipers at rear windscreen. Boot has big subaru wording across. Hidden radio antenna. Climate control aircon. IHI VF35 turbo. Max boost is 1.3 bar off factory. Single tip STi exhaust. STi NON optitron meter cluster with shift light inbuilt. Quicker steering with 2.5 turns lock to lock. 2 cat convertors. Up-pipe no cat.<br><br>280Ps JDM models are quite rare. Probably more than 20 pieces. I am referring to Post 2003 blob eye models. $150k with COE. 1994cc engines with much strengthened internals. Molydenum top crown coated pistons. A more dynamically balanced engine. 6 Speed gearbox with DCCD and adjustable centre differential. Final drive at 3.9 too. Higher air scoop. Blue and black seats with STi words embroided on front seats. Brembo brakes, gold colour, 4 pot front, 2 pot rear. Bigger drive shafts to take the abuse. REAR Wipers behind. STi quick steering sticker at rear. Boot has NO big subaru wording across. Climate control aircon. IHI VF37 twin scroll turbo. Max boost is 1.3 bar off factory. Single tip STi exhaust. One cat convertor only on down pipe.<br>Quick steering at 2.25 turns lock to lock. Optitron meter clusters with shift light inbuilt. Has sound insulation. 12 litre intercooler water tank at rear. Non-seam welded body. 17" normal STi rims.<br><br>280Ps Type RA Spec C JDM models are BLOODY RARE. Probably less than 10 pieces. I am referring to Post 2003 blob eye models. $165k with COE then. 1994cc engines with much strengthened internals, nitrided crank, high lift cams, solid lifters, sodium filled valves. Molydenum top crown coated pistons. A DAMN dynamically balanced engine. 6 Speed gearbox with DCCD and adjustable centre differential. Final drive at 3.9 too. Higher air scoop.

One cat convertor only on down pipe. Quick steering at 2.25 turns lock to lock. Optitron meter clusters with shift light inbuilt. No sound insulation. 12 litre intercooler water tank at rear.<br>Boot has no carpet. Basic luxury items are all deleted from car. Has incredible castor at front, front wheels almost touching front bumper. Seam welded chassis. Different shock absorbers with higher spring and rebound rates. 17" BBS Forged rims. And of course, INTERNAL 3rd brake lights!  Rear windscreen has the STi quick steering sticker.<br><br>This to best of my knowledge.<br></div>
