              <p>Hi, I am new to the forum and new to Singapore.  Trying to find out what are some of the more reputable Used Car Dealers or Parallel Importers around town.  What are the things to lookout for when buying from them?</p>
              <p>Here are some names I have seen so far:<br>Pinnacle<br>Custom Motor<br>Car Design Motor<br>Hua Yang<br>Car Times</p>
              <p>Also if I want to buy a car from owner directly, what are some of the things I have to do on my own?  Such as how do I go about securing a car loan on my own?  TIA.</p>

              i dont have good impression of PI... even the best ones...
              
              so unless there is a huge saving (in fact none), or a damn chio model which AD don't have, i dont bother with PI...
              
              and even if must buy thru PI, i will also pick those big ones cos less chance of bankrupt and cock up your purchase or warranty

              Thanks ALN.  Can you elaborate a little more on the Pros and Cons between Dealers (or are they call Agents?) and Paralle Importers?  As I mentioned before, I am new to Singapore and not fully understands the parallel import concept.  I mean, to me, it seems as the Parallel Importers give you more accessories or features to the car with similar  pricing than the dealers do.
              
              Anyone else can give information on Car Loans?  How to secure your own if buying direct from Direct Owners?

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The problem with parallel importers is there are just too many of them and difficult for the consumer to filter out the unscrupulous ones. Some of the PI companies are just one man show and can easily just wind up and start a company with another name the next day. So that's why people say, better to find a PI with a good reputation and history. Nowadays, PI warranties may be more than AD. Some offering 5 yrs/100,000km warranties for JDM cars. Do not believe everything you see in car forums as many PI are just lurking around and sabotaging other PI companies. For peace of mind, my advice is go with the ADs.</p></div>
