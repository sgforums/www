Some are G'ranteed COE (1,3 or 6 bids) some are not.  So if possible, get these g'ranteed deals.<br><br>It will be unlikely for you to get freebies once u sign on the dotted line.. as to changing of colours and models.. depends on which dealer you go to.  Are you looking at Vios?  If so, I suggest go test drive other cars around that kinda price range.  Go check out the Fiat Panda (ok.. I'm bias.. keke).. its nice and cheerful.. plus the Dealer is very flexible.. unlike.. uhem.. BM.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My rule of thumb is that if you want to maintain a normal saloon car, a safe amount to set aside for one is $1k a month...

By doing so, you're actually working for the bank because the car loan and the credit card interest rates will make your life miserable. If you earn $10k by all means, get what you want, but if you want to struggle to get a car, then you have to be prepared to endure the suffering for another 5-10 years of the car loan. The thing is, many people think they can do that, but in reality, most cannot endure sufferings month and month for the next 5-10 years, in fact most can't even endure past the first few months.<br><br>Last time my gf keep crying to me about her debts, and I really hate that I had to pay up for her coz of the relationship, but my point is, consider properly now rather than regret later about the wrong decisions in life.</div>

They have no problem paying 100% cash for any new cars in the market. But some chose not to drive and others drive small car. Reason being car is a depreciating assets and a liability.<br><br>In fact, many poor drive fancier and more expensive cars than the rich. Frankly, how many people actually Â‘ownÂ’ the car? Do you want to know why only 1% of the populations are rich and 99% poor?
