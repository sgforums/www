            <div class='col-md body'>Believe many of you have seen the PS/HP vs KW/Kgm graph before. Actually how do you interprete for the intersection when the 2 lines meet. Does that mean the optimum RPM which you should switch your gear getting the maximum efficiency from engine?<br><br>Also what could you deduce with a graph where the 2 lines never intersect?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh this, ok i'll try explaining without a graph. basically, one line shows the change in bhp with increase in rpms, one line shows the change in torque with increase in rpms. torque is needed for acceleration, bhp is needed for speed. tuning should be done so that the bhp curve intersects the torque curve somewhere near the peak. and once that is done, u shift your gear so that your rpms is always between the 2 peaks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In addition to the 2 intersecting lines, a more specific graph might give you efficiency curves.  This curves cut across and give you an approximate efficiency at which you are running at a specific horsepower and torque.  Very useful more for rpm vs horsepower graphs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've always been confused about the concepts of torque &amp; horsepower, so did some research on google.<br><br>Torque and hp are not really intuitive to grasp, and here are some of the easier-to-understand links I've found:<br><a href="http://www.nissanperformancemag.com/november98/torque.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.nissanperformancemag.com/november98/torque.shtml</a><br><br><a href="http://www.allpar.com/eek/hp-vs-torque.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allpar.com/eek/hp-vs-torque.html</a><br><br><a href="http://vettenet.org/torquehp.html" rel="nofollow">http://vettenet.org/torquehp.html</a><br><br>Essentially, the articles come to the same conclusion as many of you have mentioned - torque is responsible for acceleration (how hard your head is thrown against the seat when you floor it), while hp is a representation of how much torque your engine can produce at high rpms - and would be more important for top speed.<br><br>They say that torque and hp are mathematically related by the formula:<br><br>Hp (bhp) = Torque (lbs.ft) x rpm / 5252 (if torque is given in US units)   OR<br><br>Hp (bhp) = Torque (Nm) x rpm / 7023.5  (if torque is given in Nm)<br><br>I think this means that the max torque &amp; hp specs we read so often are basically 2 snapshot views of an engine's torque curve, at different rpms.  The max torque shows the engine's peak torque, which happens at a certain rpm level, while the max hp indicates how much torque it can pump out at a higher rpm.<br><br>Eg.  Car A has max torque of 145Nm at 4000rpms &amp; max hp of 100bhp at 6500rpms.  From the formula, when the car is generating max hp at 6500rpms, it is pushing out <strong>108Nm of torque</strong>.<br><br>Car B has <strong>same max torque </strong>of 145Nm at 4000rpms but higher max hp of 120bhp at 6500rpms.  From the formula, Car B is pushing out <strong>130Nm</strong> at 6500rpms.  So Car B can accelerate harder at 6500rpms than Car A, although they accelerate just as hard at 4000rpms.<br><br>The formula also means that all hp-torque charts will always intersect at 7023.5rpm, IF the units are given in bhp and Nm, AND the scales are the same, regardless of car, engine, tuning, TC or NA.<br><br>So for the WRX Sti graph posted above, which shows 206kW = 280bhp at 6000 rpm, the formula predicts that at 6000rpm, the torque should be 328Nm.  See where the 6000rpm line intersects the blue torque curve and yup, its around 328Nm.<br><br>The articles go on to recommend that its <strong>better to upshift at redline</strong>, rather than anywhere else based on the shape of the curves.<br><br>What do you guys think of the analysis given in the links?</div>

From the formula, when the car is generating max hp at 6500rpms, it is pushing out [b]108Nm of torque</strong>.<br><br>Car B has <strong>same max torque </strong>of 145Nm at 4000rpms but higher max hp of 120bhp at 6500rpms.  From the formula, Car B is pushing out <strong>130Nm</strong> at 6500rpms.  So Car B can accelerate harder at 6500rpms than Car A, although they accelerate just as hard at 4000rpms.<br><br>The formula also means that all hp-torque charts will always intersect at 7023.5rpm, IF the units are given in bhp and Nm, AND the scales are the same, regardless of car, engine, tuning, TC or NA.<br><br>The articles go on to recommend that its <strong>better to upshift at redline</strong>, rather than anywhere else based on the shape of the curves.<br><br>What do you guys think of the analysis given in the links?  [/b]</blockquote>dunno about the link but i think u've offered a pretty comprehensive explaination about torque n bhp. well done!</div>
