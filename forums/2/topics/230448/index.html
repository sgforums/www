            <div class='col-md body'>thanks pyjamasgirl for suggesting the forums. cos actually u know im looking at 2 hatches. one is either the jazz/fit or the swift which have both versions.<br><br>vanquish - ur ans is as good as mine. i also wonder if pi not so good how come so much wish on the road? what in what way safer?<br><br>t.ryouske may be true, spare part prob, may have to bang table, but alot of pi firms, they say they top 50 or so. i did went to one pi firm and they say they top promising companies in sg. so maybe that may be a booster cos he also said, local car comps also never get such awards.<br><br>imprezaWRXSTi22B - what is this twc and shc forums? do u have links to em?<br><br>i just want to make good comparisons. would be nice if any pi car owner can give me some tips on what makes them want to buy. cos u see now coe so low, i will consider it a car buyer market. i have the choice. but being a car idiot, just want to know if i can save money now, will i save money later. cos they say both cars are typically the same. so why local agents can mark up cars so high. are they making too much money out of us?<br><br>thanks u peeps for ur responses. look forward to more responses!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PI need to sell cheaper to attract more customers. who will buy from PI if its more exp than AD? theres more risks than ADs.<br><br>TWC is toyota wish club. pple have no choice since Borneo Motors doesnt carry Wish and its a $60k +/- MPV. relatively cheap and good looking though thats subjective.<br><br>SHC is singapore honda club. again pple have no choice but to turn to PI for the JDM (Japan Domestic Model) Accord CL7. Kah Motor's accord is far uglier and made in thai. and if u love the CL7R, which is the Accord Euro R, u have no choice but to turn to PIs. so its not that PIs are popular, its just that the silly ADs choose not to bring in certain models and pple who love the mentioned models have no choice but to turn to PIs.<br><br>very good threads on PIs:<br><br><a href="http://www.mycarforum.com/forum/General_C1/General_Car_Discussion_F1/Guide_on_buying_from_PI_P1325248/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mycarforum.com/forum/General_C1/General_Car_Discussion_F1/Guide_on_buying_from_PI_P1325248/</a><br><br>the above is basically derived from the PI discussion in SHC.<br><br><a href="http://www.shc-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=61234" rel="nofollow">http://www.shc-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=61234</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PIs may have higher OMV. and may be cheaper. i dun deny that. but do lots of homework, i mean LOTS, before committing. if u bothered to read the threads above, its a shitty feeling to spend $$ on something that doesnt arrive on time as promised. worse still when u have traded in or scraped ur car and u have no car to use. or even worse the car is delivered already, only for some jokers to tow it away although u thought u had paid for it.<br><br>im not PI or AD agent. so dun ask me who to recommend. but if u r keen on getting PI fit or swift, go into the respective car clubs and ask for recommendations. or even for specific agents who handled transactions well. im sure u will receive help. but becareful of pple who are actually agents and recommend themselves to u in forum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the thing about cars these days are that they are full of electronics and sensitive parts and PIs <span style="font-style: italic;">do not</span> have the equipment to repair certain sensitive parts. A friend's father brought in an MB E240 via PI and it developed several problems including one where the radio was stuck at 92.4 and couldnt be changed. PI tried everything and suggested to remove the radio and ship back to germany or something la, basically it was a big hassle. my friend's dad finally relented, went to C&amp;C where he literally had to beg them for service ... and dont forget - PIs can open,close and change their names in the blink of an eye. Saving $4k now might seem tempting, but resale will be a problem too. My advice is to just stick with ADs ...</div>
