            <div class='col-md body'>if u're tokin abt the 1st civics wif the large headlights then it should be EXi instead of ESi. my dad drove the VTi auto before the current one. he kinda regretted not spending 8k more on the SiR manual which came wif many extra plusses like significantly more horsepower, rims, leather seats, sunroof. basically dere were no big qualms abt the VTi. decent performance wif decent fuel economy. cvt transmission is smooth i muz say. guess he just din like the floating effect; hondas are said to be dangerously light.</div>
