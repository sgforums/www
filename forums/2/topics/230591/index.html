            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys! I intend to install solar film for my car, but heard alot of negative comments for various brands.  These are some things that i'm concern.<br><br>1) The Solar Film must not interfere with my Portable GPS system,auto-gate remote control and even the car remote control,cos i heard  that some solar film will affect the distance of the reception for car remote control.<br><br>2) Will the suction cup for my portable GPS stand be able to stick to the windscreen after installing the solar film?<br><br>3) I dont like the idea to cut a hole at the ERP area too.<br><br>4) I heard that ceramic based is better than metallic based solar film.  Is that true??<br><br>5) What brands do you recommend?? I am considering Rike Cool at the moment as from what i know it is ceramic based which is better compare to V-Kool that is metallic based.<br><br>Hope you guys can help me with it.

Installer will take out the ERP set and put back again afterwards. If u r concern abt affecting the ERP operation, it wont be affected in the first place..<br>4) Dunno<br>5) Dunno....... Mine i dont even know what brand, but i did at tint-master..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>most solar film providers advertise their products to be non-conductive of the signals, so this should be fine.<br><br>i don't think these providers will prefer cutting a hole for the in-car unit, it serves more fuss for them. for my dad's car which just installed, they took the unit down before attaching the film, then stuck the unit back up.<br><br>regarding the film causing unpleasant reflection at the demister lines, ours is indeed experiencing this just after installation. according to the boss, this is normal, as the film takes sometime to cure.<br><br>for example, we were reminded not to use the power windows for 48 hours, and not to activate the demister for 2 weeks. this is because there is inevitably still some moisture between the film and the glass, but it'll eventually dry up as the film is mildly porous. this is why most cars which are just installed with solar films are advised to be exposed to the sun as much as possible to aid the curing.<br><br>for the brand, you may refer to my other thread where i gave a brief humble review.<br><br><a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=230272" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=230272</a></div>
