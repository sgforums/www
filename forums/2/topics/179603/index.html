There is a form that you will have to fill up at LTA certifying the previous owner has agreed to transfer the number plate to you and you are requesting to put it on "hold" or "in transition" (even if the car is ready already). Then your dealer can do up the form to put the number plate onto your new car.<br><br>If your car already has a number plate and you are switching number plates, $100 to hold your "new" number plate in transition and about $1,000 to switch number plates with the other car.

You have to transfer together with the car and pay the transfer fee for the car. After that, scrap the car, retain number and register on new car. This can be quite affordable if you are transfering an old car with low transfer fee. Need to factor in insurance too thought, even if its for one day !!<br><br>Transfer of numbers between two cars under the SAME owner is 1.3k per car, that makes it 2.6K for the two cars.<br><br>Overall, its more troublesome now and be prepared to pay a few K just for the transfer admin alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Their staff not all well trained/info. They need to check their system. My advise is to go down personally n get all relevent form.<br><br>Example 1<br>In gereral if u own a car (called A) and buying a new car (called B), B plate can be trafer to A car by paying a retention fee of $100 dollars. These two car must be the same name/owner.<br><br>Example 2<br>If u wanted a plate that pple selling on yr new car, u need to transfer the ownership of that car (with the plate u like) and follow example 1. This will involve cost like the price of the plate, the transfer fee for the car to transfer to your name, the insurance for the transfer, the $100 retention fee and if car not scrap u may need to tranfer back to its owner.<br><br>Example 3<br>If u wanted a plate that pple selling on yr OLD car, u need to transfer the ownership of that car (with the plate u like) and follow example 2. But this time the amount payable to LTA will be $1300<br><br>Example 4<br>If u selling yr car n want to retain yr plate for 1 yr, U need to pay LTA $1300 and get all paper work done. Yr old car will be given new number plate and u can sell it off. When yr retain plate is eventually put on a NEW car LTA will refund u $1200.<br><br>Hope this help.</div>
