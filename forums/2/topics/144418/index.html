            <div class='col-md body'>i'm thinking of getting a second-hand kangoo. Wondering how much are the expenses such as road tax, insurance etc?? I heard that the maintenance fees are higher than a car due to the fact that it drinks diesel instead of petrol, how true is this?? What are the things i need to know abt owning a van?? I have no problem registering the van under a company name.<br><br>and i'm wondering if kangoo is a better choice?? best is to hear some advices from those who currently own one. Thx.</div>
