              <p>Hey.. My brother bought a new Mazda Demio (Mazda 2 - 2007) for only 3 months but seems to have some problems now.</p>
              <p>Yesterday when he was driving, the car begin to jerk, but not those violent type of jerk. I was sitted beside my bro and I saw the orange color indicator lighted up. And there'a a word "HOLD" flashing too.</p>
              <p>He drove to the nearest petrol station for help and the staff checked the front. Engine oil is enough, battery water is enough, the coolant also enough... so what is the problem?</p>
              <p>Can anyone possibly pinpoint what is wrong with the car? Could it be the "computerised thingy" which cause these problems????</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Simple! Go to your nearest Mazda dealer right away. If your Mazda is a manual, the jerking is quite normal if you clutch control is not so good. But a flashing "HOLD" light? Never heard before. The "HOLD" is not supposed to flash. Oh wait, since it has a "HOLD", it must be an automatic then. Sorry about the manual part.<br><br>But since it's jerking, and if it's auto, it could be a transmission problem. And the "HOLD" is also linked to the transmission. So it is most likely a transmission problem or some electornics problem.<br><br>Go to the Mazda dealer as soon as possible. You wouldn't want to be stranded in the middle of the road with a susupected broken transmission.</p></div>

But if your Bro has been rough with the auto tranny - (eg... selecting reverse if the car is not fully stationery or constantly putting it into Neutral when at the traffic lights")<br><br>My dad has a Mazda 2 (3 years old) and so far it hasn't been a problem. I'm really not sure what your problem is. And you bought it from a parallel importer? That's bad, some of their after sales service are attrocious. There's some Shell petrol kiosk that services Mazdas. Try the one along Commonwealth Ave (near Queenstown MRT) if your current workshop is problematic.<br><br>But I'm still wondering why you bought it from PI when Mazda Motors's version is quite good (top end version). If cost is an issue then I understand. Anyway, hope your problems can be solved soon :)</p></div>

While scanning though the owner's manual. <br><br>It states that "CAUTION! - If the HOLD indicator lights flashes, the transaxle has an electrical problem. Continuing driving your Mazda in this condition could cause damage to your transaxle"<br><br>It seems to be a serious problem and good thing ur bro brought it to the workshop.|<br><br>Maybe ur PI car is probelmatic. That's why alot of people would rather buy a official dealer car because you will never know where the PI gets it car from and how they medel with it</p></div>
