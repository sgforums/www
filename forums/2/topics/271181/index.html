            <div class='col-md body'>no.1) odometer<br><br>no.2) plastics + safety labels - showroom/road cars would have had these removed; esp those around the chairs. unless you're buying a premium car, most dealers/ses (in fact, all, as far as i'm aware) would not go through the trouble of beautifying the car for your collection<br><br>no.3) tyres/rims - feathering on tyres tells of the car having being driven, along with stone chips<br><br>no. 4) general exterior/interior visual appearance<br><br>-<br>to be honest; you can never tell. i can understand where you come from; having changed cars a number of times, i still remain as paranoid about what i'm receiving. then again, dealers have alot more at stake than you do; doubtfult hey will take such a risk. this applies to proper dealers; not PI or beng beng shops.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah.. authorized dealers don't have that kind of balls to try pass off used or demo cars as new units. There will be some ppl who want the so-called "best price" for a particular model, and the sales will usually direct them to their demo cars and quote them prices below than that of a new one. What you should look for is those 2nd hand car marts, the market for 2nd is slowing so they may pull all sorts of tricks just to  sell off anything.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
