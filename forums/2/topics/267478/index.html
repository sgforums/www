            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans really have the short end of the stick. When they want to obtain a piece of paper, called the Driving License, to be able to drive a car here they need to go through a long process of theory tests, practice lessons and finally a practical test. The lessons are not cheap now with the 7% GST. Each lesson is now close to $80 (SGD) for a student enrolled in a public-driving school. Mind you, it's per lesson.

The first time you didn't pass the practical test, you basically have to cough out another substantial amount of cash to book for the next test date (i.e. if you are still keen to have your license). Of course, it's getting harder and harder these days to get a license.<br><br>I do know of people who come from other countries who just convert their foreign licenses and drive on our roads here. Compare their driving test criteria and ours, I think our criteria for passing are much more stringent.<br>The objective of our stringent criteria is to control the number of cars on the road and also to make sure our drivers are taught to the highest level of safety awareness before they are allow to drive on the roads in Singapore which are good.<br>However, do those who came here with foreign licenses which are later converted to local ones, go through a strict criteria before they obtained their foreign licenses? I think not. But, are they allow to drive on Singapore roads? The answer is yes.<br><br>So, why not make those holding foreign licenses also go through our practical tests?
