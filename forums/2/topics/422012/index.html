              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : The car rental business is up this Lunar New Year 
              season. Industry players said that compared to the same period last 
              year, it has gone up 25 to 30 per cent.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Rental cars are a popular option to ferry family and friends this festive season.<br><br>But this year's demand has revved up much higher than usual. <br><br>K
               K Ho, general manager of Popular Rent A Car, said: "We figured it is 
              because of the recovery of the economy and also because of the sudden 
              rise in COE, which (are) some reasons why the buyers, some of those who 
              find it too expensive to buy a car, world prefer to rent a car instead."<br><br>Some companies said their car rental fleet was booked way ahead this year. <br><br>But the downside to the high demand is that prices are being jacked up by at least 20 per cent across the industry.<br><br>Customers however do not seem to mind the extra cost, as long as they can get their hands on a set of hired wheels.<br><br>One
               customer, Esther Loo, said: "The rental fee is kind of higher this 
              year. But I think it is is still more economical because car prices are 
              high due to the increase in COEs."<br><br>Meanwhile, unlike mass market 
              vehicles, demand for cars such as Ferraris and Lamborghinis has been 
              more or less constant compared to the previous year. <br><br>Chris 
              Cheah, operations manager at Luxe Car Rental, said: "These cars cater to
               a very niche clientele and not only that; during the Chinese New Year 
              period, people go visiting a lot. So these cars are not very practical, 
              you can't really carry a lot of people and a lot of stuff. You can't 
              park in a lot of car parks, so I do not see a big difference in the 
              demand."<br><br>However, sales of such cars have spiked with more Singaporeans getting affluent. <br><br>Luxe
               Rental, the first car rental company in Singapore to offer these 
              high-end cars, said it expects demand in future to grow in tandem. Thus,
               it is looking at increasing its fleet to meet any increase in future 
              demand.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>
