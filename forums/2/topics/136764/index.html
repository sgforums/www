            <div class='col-md body'>That stretch of road is dangerous as there is a slight slope downwards and slight bend towards the interchange. As such driver tend to take this corner at high speed for trills. The traffice light no doubt is space near between each other but if u drive within the speed limit you won't need to beat the light.<br><br>Drive within speed limit. Please drive with care.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tomas_Rosicko, i never post such an experience for u to make such a judgemental statement. Everyone do make little mistakes during driving... dont sound as if u are so perfect and u have the biggest rite to conclude who is fit to drive and who is not fit to drive. U are the one who can also go home and sleep cos such statements made by u is able to show that u are not tactful with ur words.<br><br>This post is mainly for pple who have similar experiences to share<br><br>And i was not speeding. When it turns amber and i am on the stop line of course i accelerate and go thru it what. If not slow down?<br><br>Its not at the sloping and turning portion.. the road is str8 and flat.<br><br>My friends onboard wasnt aware the traffic light till it was so near too ... thats why he never warned me abt it.<br><br>Anyway pedestrians are abt to step on the road from the left... i was on the right lane so it was pretty far lah... hope my first post never sound like the pedestrians are so close to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just stayed at the block opposite the bus interchange. In the past when Serangoon bus interchange just opened, the pedestrain crossing was together with the bus interchange exit (where the buses make sharp left turn from interchange slope towards Boundary Road), however it resulted in fatal accident where a student got killed by a left turn bus due to blind spot at the sharp turn, and several time near accident. So they shifted the traffic light further down due to many many complains (to the location which you beat the red light). The 2 traffic light usually turn red together, so even if you managed to beat one, you will most likely endanger yourself as well as others in the 2nd one.</div>
