            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the feedback. Book my colt Plus liao....for 67k with C&amp;C with 2 k rebate if i take loan for 7yrs. It got almost lots of automatic functions and is one of few that has a 6gear CVT and MIVEC engine. Altough performance wise is unmatchable to my SIR but consider good for a 1.5l car.<br><br>Have to say bye bye to my Cvic SIR soon. Really unbearable to let go after 7 yrs  but no choice....... sigh..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  All things have to come to the end...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  But my sales in C&amp;C really not bad give me lots of freebies more than i expected....anyone want to buy Mitsubishi cars I can recommend him.....although he is not really not good in sales talk but i see he as done his best in all those freebies......... and also give me another $500 for my SIR scrape value......<br><br>Car Tested during my car shopping : Latio, Lancer, Sunny, Colt plus turbo <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Tested Colt Plus turbo only slighty better than ori version so i feel not veri worth it....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agreed with Jonathan, altho I am new here. Having read your point of view regarding Mit. Colt Plus. I decided to be a member here sharing my "pains" about this fellow car.<br><br>67k for a colt plus is definitely not worth it. With this amount, you have a lot of better options but not a 1.5 or 1.4 cars. I regretted buying this car as it is "so problematic" from the day one I received it. Mine at 65k...<br><br>I tekan the salesman like hell in LengKee one, guess his name is Daniel something. He is very nua, go ahead suck his blood if you are those buay paisei type. Cuz with that amount, i had my colt plus exactly like a turbo version of plus version but diff. engine, of course...light weight sport rims, body kit, tinted windows, 3rd party cut sunroof, petrol voucher, etc. In fact, i waited for 2 months to receive my rims.<br><br>Within this 2 months, this car does not perform like the one that i tested. Seated with full passg. is totally disappointed. Mivec engine roar like hell but claw like tortise. Gear 6 is even worst....i wonder why they design 6 gears for this car. If you are toking about petrol consumption, haiz... 8~9k/lit with light weight rims some more.<br><br>Tok about the "boot door", it spoilt after a week which I have manually close it. Leg room pretty jia lat for a 170cm tall man like me. Now my gear box started to "clak clak claking", and i have no idea if pple said Mit. gear box problem is true or not.<br><br>If i never owned this car, i would prefer to spend my money on civic, mazda, nissan or the cheaper altis. Regretted man....at least i dont think 67k for colt plus worth it. No wonder didnt see many of them on the road.<br><br>In fact, in terms of power - i like the turbo version. I tested it twice. U gonna try it with manual mood and you will feel the power. That's all for me, i hope i can sell it as soon as i can but still few more years to go.... sianz...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kingkong_1234:</div><div class="quote_body">I agreed with Jonathan, altho I am new here. Having read your point of view regarding Mit. Colt Plus. I decided to be a member here sharing my "pains" about this fellow car.<br><br>67k for a colt plus is definitely not worth it. With this amount, you have a lot of better options but not a 1.5 or 1.4 cars. I regretted buying this car as it is "so problematic" from the day one I received it. Mine at 65k...<br><br>I tekan the salesman like hell in LengKee one, guess his name is Daniel something. He is very nua, go ahead suck his blood if you are those buay paisei type. Cuz with that amount, i had my colt plus exactly like a turbo version of plus version but diff. engine, of course...light weight sport rims, body kit, tinted windows, 3rd party cut sunroof, petrol voucher, etc. In fact, i waited for 2 months to receive my rims.<br><br>Within this 2 months, this car does not perform like the one that i tested. Seated with full passg. is totally disappointed. Mivec engine roar like hell but claw like tortise. Gear 6 is even worst....i wonder why they design 6 gears for this car. If you are toking about petrol consumption, haiz... 8~9k/lit with light weight rims some more.<br><br>Tok about the "boot door", it spoilt after a week which I have manually close it. Leg room pretty jia lat for a 170cm tall man like me. Now my gear box started to "clak clak claking", and i have no idea if pple said Mit. gear box problem is true or not.<br><br>If i never owned this car, i would prefer to spend my money on civic, mazda, nissan or the cheaper altis. Regretted man....at least i dont think 67k for colt plus worth it. No wonder didnt see many of them on the road.<br><br>In fact, in terms of power - i like the turbo version. I tested it twice. U gonna try it with manual mood and you will feel the power. That's all for me, i hope i can sell it as soon as i can but still few more years to go.... sianz...</div></blockquote>u r one unhappy owner of a lemon.<br><br>how did u come across tat it crawl like tortoise? did u actually test drive it? u r aware it has a CVT engine which btw is not exactly gg to give u the omph in terms of pickup. with CVT, u hv to b lightfooted.<br><br>MIVEC does not kick in when u rev immediately. it goes something like 3.5K rpm.<br><br>I wun b surprised if u get only 8-9km/l on the initial run in. try to be gentle n patient with it, and u will b rewarded. it has a newer engine then previous model so FC will b better.<br><br>If u r still facing problem with ur car, do let me know and I'll try to connect u with the right pple to sort things out for u.<br><br></div>
