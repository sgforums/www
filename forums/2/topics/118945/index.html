            <div class='col-md body'>you shoulg visit<br>http://www.mercedes-benz-usa.com/e_class.php<br><br>Phil writes:<br>I purchased a new 2003 e320 in October 2002.At first i was very excited to receive my new vehicle.That excitement turned to misery only 1 day after i drove the car home. My wife went to use the car and coudn't get the seat belt to realease from its retracted position.i brought the car back to the dealer and it took 3 days to correct the problem.I drove the car for approx 1 week and an indicator light alerted me to the fact my abs and srs was not functioning.This was attributed to a Gateway failure that took 3 weeks to fix.The third insult came a month later when I started hearing an annoying knock coming from the rear of the car.This was the 3rd or 4th trip back to the dealer in as many months as i had the car.At first they told me it was a loose heat shield.After driving the car out of the service area and getting on a fairly uneven road the thumping was still evident.I scheduled another appointment and started to get that sinking feeling of not making the right choice in buying this vehicle.On the Fifth service the thumping was identified as 2 defective rear shocks.This took almost 4-5 months to sort out.My latest outrage is having to pay $720.00 for brake pads front and rear,without rotors.I only have 21,500 miles on the OD.All of the other premium brand cars i have owned went atleast 30,000 and it would only be the front pads needing replacement.I just brought the car in for an oil change and a brake recall.I like Mercedes slogan "Service like any other" Should be "Service worse than any other"My partner has an ML 350 and he is also having his hands full fixing problems.<br><br></div>
