Rather than down, new COE quota may go up since itÂ’s based on no. of vehicles deregistered and guided by a 3% increase of cars on the road.  No. of vehicles deregistered in 2005 is still higher than 2004.  In fact, even if the new quota remains the same, COE will most likely even go down.<br><br>Observe that COE continues to trend lower at similar bids to quota ratio from these 2 events which happened at similar COE quota of ~2800 but evoked the same knee jerk reactions (Cat A COE):<br><br>When COE fell SUDDENLY from 15.3k to 12k in OctÂ’05, 5927 bids followed in the next tender. Result was COE went up +2.5k to 14.5k.  COE then went down -4.5k to 10k level GRADUALLY.<br><br>When COE fell SUDDENLY from 10.6k to 8k in JanÂ’06, 5517 bids followed in the next tender. Result was COE went up +2.3k to 10.3k.  Hence, if COE quota remains similar, itÂ’s very likely to see COE going down GRADUALLY again. This means COE may even reach 5-6k subsequently.<br><br>Other reasons which dampen COE increase are:<br><br>1) Govt policy is to shift cost of car from ownership to usage.<br><br>2) Oil price, parking, ERP will increase vehicle usage costs and people will be discouraged to pay more for vehicle ownership.<br><br>3) Those who want to change new cars will have to fork out more cash since paper value of car nowadays have dropped so much, which will compensate with COE downwards.<br><br>4) Interest rates going up will make it more expensive to own car effectively, putting downward pressure on COE.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

For eg, petrol cost, carpark cost etc. Even if these cost remain high potential car buyers will still own a car being the prestige and convience that tags along with owning a car.<br>Malaysia is difference, their land area is thousands times bigger than singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'>Not possible. There is no way the government can recover the lost income via ERP charges if the COE system is scrapped. As it is now, the COE remains a major source of revenue for the government.<br><br>Another reason is that the COE system allows the govt to control exactly the number of cars on the road (via the number of COEs released). This is to prevent traffic congestion on our small island.

            <div class='col-md body'>my take is Coe will remain stable in the region of 10-15k.<br>not likely for it to shoot pass 20k again. There will be no demand as ppl are conditioned to 'low' car price now.<br><br>On the other hand, the hope of COE dropping back to 5-8k is highly unlikely as well...<br><br></div>

I don't think that is possible. but 5-6k is possible if quota remains the same. otherwise, probably stay around 8-10k.  good for 1st time car buyers.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by incredibleduck:</div><div class="quote_body">think abt it, coe is to control the no of cars on the rd. so it has to be a significant enuff portion of the car cost to have an impact....<br><br>if coe does fall to 5k, i think it wld not be such an influencing factor in a person's decision whether or not to buy a car anymore. hence, i tink coe probably wld not fall to such lows....<br></div></blockquote>Yes, coe is to control no. of cars, but it's dependent on no. of cars deregistered and guided by a 3% annual increase. since no. of cars deregistered last year is still higher than the year before, i don't think the figure will suddenly reduce for this year, hence won't expect too much change from last year.<br><br>Yes, 5k for Cat A will represent about 10% of total car cost, so I think it shouldn't fall lower, unless distributors start undercutting each other and make less margin...</div>
