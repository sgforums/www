            <div class='col-md body'>you should not just look at civil servant, your perspective is very shallow. if i'm not wrong some of these drivers maybe actually NSFs (any SCDF pple can enlighten on this?) same for the LSV drivers, i believe some are NSFs.<br><br>Civil servants are all that work under the government service, meaning Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment guys are all also civil servants. NSFs are not considered civil servants.<br><br>it just happened that these SCDF drivers are on the roads more often and need to rush to a certain destination within time, and at the right place right time an accident happen.</div>

Did you actually tried to find out whose fault is it before shooting it off.<br><br>I can see that you are concerned about the military/civil service traffic accidents, which contribute probably about 5-10% of all traffic accidents. From your words, u must be thinking that the other 95% of accidents caused by the general public are also not fully trained, although they passed their driving test. " What the hell are they doing, and what is on their mind also? ". Maybe you are shooting urself in the foot by saying this?<br><br>Each traffic accident is unique and should be treated independently , rather then grouping them up and making sweeping statements.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Accidents in SAF is usuallyall because of driver... I wsa a driver inside so I kno... Why did all those accidents happen? Do u all really tink it happen due to what the report says... come on... its always the case of some driver trying funny stuff or stupid things or sometimes just plain late reactions. There are some accidents which I see during my NS time and I can tell you... 75% is cause by foolishness inside. Same goes for scdf. There will be a root cause for any accident that happen. Even if you are speeding to go for emergency, if the driver feels something is wrong, they should beware.. its call driver instinct. I drove the land rover ambulance on emergency a few times to send personal to hospital. And believe me.. 110km/hr on the rover ambulance with lights on is very dangerous. With such a heavy and shaky back.<br><br>Scdf has advantages, pple see them rushing from behind would give way... but do u tink public see saf ambulance will give way... no way... i encounter it a few times untill dulan use road shoulder on expressway for emergency. Even my red blinker is on... use siren, horn, high beams..still dun give way.<br><br>And judging from what happen to the rhino tat happen on sunday afternoon, there was no second party or 3rd party. Just only that rhino itself with 4 scdf personal. Dun you find it wierd.  That road is a 2 lane. That lane is big enough to take 2 buses side by side.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Rhino is a heavy piece of machinary... look the wheels man. You can't manevour it as quick as a sedan plus going at speeds of 100km/h, it's like a speeding train. Same goes to ambulances. S AF vehicles are.... relative speaking, OLD. Land Rover robust, yes... but still OLD. It takes much more than a pass in your driving test to perform emergency cases. As for the newer 5-tonners, they have electronic speed limiter but still, such a machine going at 50km/h can be a hazard to other road users. I dunno, but are ambulance drivers further trained to handle such vehicles? i think they should.</div>
