Have you seen the power curve of the VQ35HR engine? It's fantastic, over 90% of max torque on tap is available at 2000rpm. And with a high revving engine up to 7500rpm. And a whole list of other features the engine has to offer - including improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions. Go do your homework mate. Handling is also good with 53 47 weight ratio. I don't own one (yet), but I can tell you whether you think it's a better chick magnet than the TT or not, you can compare the specs and I reckon it's a better car. Screw the branding, forget whether chicks dig it, be a real man and drive like a real man.<br>Anyway, I reckon chicks will dig a man who knows what he wants</div></blockquote>hey are you blind or something? i said the CHASSIS IS GREAT....which part of it u didnt understand? I bet u have not watched best motoring...they themselves also said that the engine is not smooth....get this...V6es will never be as smooth as inline 6es.period. oh yea...the redline is never at 7600RPM....its at 6600 RPMs...Wonder who should be the one doing up the reading  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
