            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This is a rather lengthy story but if the concept is applied to the petroleum industry en masse , it just may work.<br><br>A man eats two eggs each morning for breakfast. When he goes to the grocery store he pays 60 cents a dozen. Since a dozen eggs won't last a week he normally buys two dozens at a time.<br>One day while buying eggs he notices that the price has risen to 72 cents. The next time he buys groceries, eggs are 76 cents a dozen.<br><br>When asked to explain the price of eggs the store owner says, "The price has gone up and I have to raise my price accordingly".<br>This store buys 100 dozen eggs a day. He checked around for a better price and all the distributors have raised their prices.<br>The distributors have begun to buy from the huge egg farms. The small egg farms have been driven out of business. The huge egg farms sell 100,000 dozen eggs a day to distributors. With no competition, they can set the price as they see fit. The distributors then have to raise their prices to the grocery stores. And on and on and on.<br><br>As the man kept buying eggs the price kept going up. He saw the big egg trucks delivering 100 dozen eggs each day. Nothing changed there. He checked out the huge egg farms and found they were selling 100,000 dozen eggs to the distributors daily. Nothing had changed but the price of eggs.<br><br>Then week before Thanksgiving the price of eggs shot up to $1.00 a dozen. Again he asked the grocery owner why and was told, "Cakes and baking for the holiday". The huge egg farmers know there will be a lot of baking going on and more eggs will be used. Hence, the price of eggs goes up. Expect the same thing at Christmas and other times when family cooking, baking, etc. happen.<br><br>This pattern continues until the price of eggs is 2.00 a dozen. The man says, " There must be something we can do about the price of eggs".<br><br>He starts talking to all the people in his town and they decide to stop buying eggs. This didn't work because everyone needed eggs.<br><br>Finally, the man suggested only buying what you need. He ate 2 eggs a day. On the way home from work he would stop at the grocery and buy two eggs. Everyone in town started buying 2 or 3 eggs a day.<br><br>The grocery store owner began complaining that he had too many eggs in his cooler. He told the distributor that he didn't need any eggs. Maybe wouldn't need any all week.<br><br>The distributor had eggs piling up at his warehouse. He told the huge egg farms that he didn't have any room for eggs would<br>not need any for at least two weeks.<br><br>At the egg farm, the chickens just kept on laying eggs. To relieve the pressure, the huge egg farm told the distributor that they could buy the eggs at a lower price.<br><br>The distributor said, " I don't have the room for the %$&amp;^*&amp;% eggs even if they were free". The distributor told the grocery store owner that he would lower the price of the eggs if the store would start buying again.<br><br>The grocery store owner said, "I don't have room for more eggs. The customers are only buying 2 or 3 eggs at a time. Now if you were to drop the price of eggs back down to the original price, the customers would start buying by the dozen again".<br><br>The distributors sent that proposal to the huge egg farmers but the egg farmers liked the price they were getting for their eggs but, those chickens just kept on laying. Finally, the egg farmers lowered the price of their eggs. But only a few cents.<br><br>The customers still bought 2 or 3 eggs at a time. They said, "when the price of eggs gets down to where it was before, we will start buying by the dozen."<br><br>Slowly the price of eggs started dropping. The distributors had to slash their prices to make room for the eggs coming from the egg farmers.<br><br>The egg farmers cut their prices because the distributors wouldn't buy at a higher price than they were selling eggs for. Anyway, they had full warehouses and wouldn't need eggs for quite a while.<br><br>And those chickens kept on laying.<br><br>Eventually, the egg farmers cut their prices because they were throwing away eggs they couldn't sell.<br><br>The distributors started buying again because the eggs were priced to where the stores could afford to sell them at the lower price.<br><br>And the customers starting buying by the dozen again.<br><br>Now, transpose this analogy to the gasoline industry.<br><br>What if everyone only bought $10.00 worth of gas each time they pulled to the pump? The dealer's tanks would stay semi full all the time. The dealers wouldn't have room for the gas coming from the huge tank farms. The tank farms wouldn't have room for the gas coming from the refining plants. And the refining plants wouldn't have room for the oil being off loaded from the huge tankers coming from the oil fiends.<br><br>Just $10.00 each time you buy gas. Don't fill it up. You may have to stop for gas twice a week but, the price should come<br>down.<br><br>Think about it.<br><br>As an added note...When I buy $10.00 worth of gas that leaves my tank a little under quarter full. The way prices are jumping around, you can buy gas for $2.65 a gallon and then the next morning it can be $2.15. If you have your tank full of $2.65 gas you don't have room for the $2.15 gas. You might not understand the economics of only buying two eggs at a time but, you can't buy cheaper gas if your tank is full of the high priced stuff.<br><br>Also, don't buy anything else at the gas station; don't give them any more of your hard earned money than what you spend on gas, until the prices come down..."<br><br>..................please pass this concept around....reaching out to the mass..the world ...the universe<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your story is very convincing but let me ask u a question.<br><br>You say only buy when you need. I don't know bout petrol but your Chicken / egg story is very ironic . Instead of not giving business it actually gives more. Notice this<br><br>The man eats 2 eggs a day buys a dozen a week. so he says lets only buy what we need a day. he buys 2 a day 2x7 = 14 1 dozen = 12 .. He buys 2 eggs more then usual. Therefore your story has been proven to be complete and utter rubbish.<br><br>Fact or fiction. You decide.<br><br>LMAO in other words u top up 50$ u drive for 50$ worth of petrol u top up 10$ u drive 10$ worth of petrol dont tell me top up 10$ 5 time not = 50$ 1 time meh ? get my gist ?<br><br>Another thing is that plan works cause theres only 1 supplier to 1 area. We have many suppliers . And another thing is Dont eat eggs can eat other things. Car dont use petrol then run on what ? cooking oil ar</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lets put it this way. Almost everything needs oil to run on earth. Katrina has hit the oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. By how much do u know? From a daily output of 1.8 million barrels a day, production has been reduced TO 0.1 million barrels a day. that is a staggering 1.7 MILLION barrel disruption. Or a 94.44% disruption to daily output. There will NOT be an over supply of oil anytime soon. Ok? So stop dreaming, its not going to work. Be glad u're only having to pay more for petrol instead of for water and food. Besides, Singapore petrol prices are peanuts compared to anywhere else in the world. How would u fancy paying $3.30 a litre for petrol huh? Well thats wot people are paying herein UK. or maybe u'd like to pay $4.80 a litre like the Americans are paying now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>during the bird flu in M'sia, prices of eggs went up.. we can stop eating eggs by itself, but there are many things which requires eggs to produce- like Cakes, char kuay tiao, noodles, pastries.. etc. And these are the things that causes eggs to go out of stock.<br><br>Unless you stop eating these by-products of eggs altogether, it's unlikely that you can reduce the demand and hence, the price..<br><br>similarly, for your analogy to oil.. We dun really need on oil purely for itself. Energy is produced from oil. Unless you (and all the people in CHina)  turn off your lights, aircon, computer now.. it's unlikely that pumping less petrol in your car will make a difference to oil prices.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Katrina has hit the oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. By how much do u know? From a daily output of 1.8 million barrels a day, production has been reduced TO 0.1 million barrels a day. that is a staggering 1.7 MILLION barrel disruption. Or a 94.44% disruption to daily output. There will NOT be an over supply of oil anytime soon. Ok? So stop dreaming, its not going to work. Be glad u're only having to pay more for petrol instead of for water and food. Besides, Singapore petrol prices are peanuts compared to anywhere else in the world. How would u fancy paying $3.30 a litre for petrol huh? Well thats wot people are paying herein UK. or maybe u'd like to pay $4.80 a litre like the Americans are paying now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>And how abt comparing to other countries like malaysia n indonesia, you peanut brain cock??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look, prices are not going to come down, so deal with it and stop whining.<br><br>Heres a basic lesson in economics for those of us who are having a bit of trouble with common sense -<br><br>1. Crude oil does not automatically increase in supply, and is a finite resource. As such, as supply decreases at a steady demand level, price will rise, just as it has now.<br><br>2. Demand is now higher than ever. China is having a boom in regards to energy usage and requirement. The USA has been hit by a natural disastor which has damaged a significant amount of their oil suppling infrastructure from the Gulf of Mexico, so they are further contributing to an increased demand for oil worldwide. There is instability in the face of what has happened recently, as well as uncertainty through the emergance of Iran, the world's second largest oil supplier, as a regional power.<br><br>3. Now, ask yourself a question - why the hell would oil companies take it upon themselves to lower their prices, and why would governements such as that of Singapore go towards reducing their taxation for such a product? They are swimming in money from the sudden increases in demand, and as such will increase the selling prices of crude oil not only to cover production costs, but also to take advantage of a situation where they can increase their profits. Crude oil is an complimenting comodity, and considering the high costs of the cars and vehicles that are on the road, and the investement that the consumer had to make to purchase them, people are <strong>still going to purchase petrol as long as they own and pay for their vehicles!</strong> It will realistically take more than <span style="font-style: italic;">50% increase in current price levels within a short span of time</span> to dissuade the car-driving masses from pumping up at the gas stations, but even then they will come around to paying those prices as they have already made such a high investment for their car and are not going to allow prices at 100$ + at fillup to stop them from driving their large investement. Furthermore, driving is part of people's lifestyles now, and is running the world's economy, so as such there is no way that this naive idea of 'boycotting' will work - <span style="font-style: italic;">get real</span>.<br><br>If you cant deal with the prices, then stop you're complaining (ie. refrain from the typical habit in this country of crying and whining behind your computer) and do something productive to deal with the problem, such as scheduling the use of public transport a certain day of the week or such.</div>
