So no point risking legal fees over delaying small few hundred dollar repairs.<br>In my case, the biker took weeks to make a report. But that's ok, coz the workshop only took 1 - 2 days to make the small repairs. I just collect the car with no upfront payment and let the workshop take all the time they want handle all the 3rd party claims.  Took a few months in the end.<br><br>Maybe your scheme different from mine, coz I dun have worry where to find parts when claiming 3rd party; the workshop will settle all necessary to make a proper repair and charge all costs to the other guy. But again, I didn't have to deal with IDAC.<br><br>Good luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
