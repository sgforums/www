            <div class='col-md body'>i would say a personal rule of thumb would be to spend max 30% of your take home pay on your car. so if you take home $3000, spend the max of $900 on your car, that includes petrol and other miscellaneous stuff. In any case of emergency that you might need to sell your car, then you will not slump into a financial crisis. just my 2 cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alot of people these days pay just 10% downpayment.<br>and take a 90% loan...they get stuck with the car for like forever(10 years)<br><br>cause anytime they sell or get accident(scrap) they lose minimum 10k for small car to around 20k for large car. simply cause their installment cannot cover the depreciation.<br><br>if u take home pay is 3k for instance...spend max 15% on car maintainence. meaning get a small car. a proton or something cheap. so your installment and petrol consumption per mth is $450 and below.<br><br>downpayment is 10% of your cash in bank. meaning if u have 50k in bank...put down 5k for your car downpayment. this is possible for a small car that cost 49,999.<br><br>dont do something dumb and spend 30% of your income just so you have a bigger car to maintain and in the end if u cannot support the car...the bank will repossess it. and if u had taken a 10year loan...after the bank has repossessed the car they will send debt collectors to claim the balance for the money u owe them.<br><br>spend 30% of your income on housing installments. that is wise and not a car.<br><br>so if u make 3k...spend 1k on your housing installment. pay off the loan ASAP. interest can KILL.</div>
