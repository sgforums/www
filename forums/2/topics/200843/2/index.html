            <div class='col-md body'>It's not really about whether you drive carefully or not... Its more about whether you know when to go and when not to... and whether you're alert with your surroundings...<br><br>It's also the attitude with which you drive that is impt... if you get stressed just because there someone overtook you... or cut into your lane... then you should really take a step back and ask youself whether you should really be driving..<br><br>I just came back from Aus not long ago... their drivers there are definitely more considerate... letting you cut in front of them... STOPPING in the lane just so you can turn out to the main road... even if there is a line of about 20 cars on the road... not even one horn will have sounded... drivers there are patient... and understanding...<br><br>So really... is it the drivers or your own attitude that is stressing you out?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>frankly speaking, singaporeans are generally very poor and weak in their driving and steering wheel control. On our roads, you don't see many drivers signalling when making a turn or changing lanes, this is because most singaporeans are actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not skilful enough</span> to signal, check mirrors and turn their steering wheel at the same time in one movement and at high speed, shame on these people who have difficulty signalling, To put it bluntly, these bunch of pathetic poor drivers are either having problems with their hand coordinations and steering wheel control, or are extremely poor in road navigation and indecisive on which route to use. This handicapped phenomena is apparent among speedsters and inexperienced taxi drivers who are not able to signal when they are speeding. These bunch of drivers whose skills and techniques are below average should go and enrol for driving refresher's course and polish up their god damn driving skills.<br><br>In Australia, u notice all their drivers signal, regardless whether they are veteran drivers or new drivers, signalling is respecting other road users.<br><br>In singapore, apparently you fellow singaporeans treat one another like cow dungs, look at your own kiasu behaviours everywhere, singapore drivers are arrogant, yet lousy</div>
