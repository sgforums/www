              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">This morning, i was crossing at pedestrian crossing. Both legs have stepped on zebra crossing, then just before i took another step this car is driving fast pass in front of me. I would be knocked down by Car Sxx 220R if i walk faster by 2 sec..</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">This driver should have stopped and wait for pedestrian to go first before moving on. He should know the traffic rules. How can such people pass their practical driving test. He thinks that the road is own by his grandfather.</span></p>

              <p>I type the driver's point of view for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This morning, saw another jay walking pedestrain. Cross zebra crossing never pay attention. As he was 5 second from being in my way, I just cruise by him. He give a shocked look, as though he thought he was actually in any danger at all.</p>
              <p>Cross the road pay attention lah. You see zebra crossing, you watch out for cars. Even primary school kids know that. you either slow down or speed up, so it will be clear to the driver whether he should stop or not, not bua long long hold up the whole line of traffic.</p>
              <p>I wonder if got any law to punish jay walkers.</p>

              <p>let me speak fm pedestrian point of view..................</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>many a times, drivers simply pay no attention to pedestrians at the zebra crossing or red light crossing............i believe time is precious to them drivers...that every sec and min counts..........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after having experience some near deaths from drivers from hell, i never make any crossing until the driver comes to a complete halt....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>never take your chances............spore drivers juz lacked discipline and consideration for others........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, there are drivers who are considerate enough to stop and signal for you to cross over........but they are far fm many.......</p>

              <p>The female species are the one that just walk without looking, the drivers are expected to look out for them.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, drivers also need to look out for cyclists. These two wheelers are fast. They are nowhere near the zebra crossing when you approach, but when you are near they just zoom across. Their attitude, you knock me, you at fault.</p>

              <p>cars slowing down before the crossing doesnt help either..........cos u never know he or she is slowing down before coming to a complete halt or not.........like i said, do not take chances.......</p>

              <p>wait for the car to stop completely even though u might look like an idiot cos most of the times, the drivers would not even bother about you standing there waiting for them to stop before u make a crossing.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there are incidents whereby even at red light crossing that the cars could not even stop in time and almost hit the pedestrians who also could not careless by walking the moment the little green man comes on......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>of course there are some pedestrians who contributed to near miss or actual accidents and in the course ''victimised'' the drivers......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>these pedestrians are kings and queens of the road, they walk as if they have some sort of special force fields that can block cars or stop cars from hitting them.......worst still, sometimes, they have children in tow and i m amazed that they value their lives relatively cheaply including their beloved younglings.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>before we can progress and develop self discipline and graciousness for our drivers and pedestrians...spore pedestrian crossings are generally, still unsafe, relatively speaking.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my two cents...... </p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">This morning, i was crossing at pedestrian crossing. Both legs have stepped on zebra crossing, then just before i took another step this car is driving fast pass in front of me. I would be knocked down by Car Sxx 220R if i walk faster by 2 sec..</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">This driver should have stopped and wait for pedestrian to go first before moving on. He should know the traffic rules. How can such people pass their practical driving test. He thinks that the road is own by his grandfather.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">I wonder how come there is no hush law to punish such reckless driver. Such as take away their license for life, longer jail terms etc</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">It is not hard to understand why there are more fatal road accidents as report in newspaper.</span></p>

              <p>basically we already have a good road transport system..<br><br>but each person who defies the rules... like still crossing after time's already up, vehicles going into yellow box and cutting queues on filter lanes(this irks me most as i go home by PIE&gt;KJE&gt;BKE&gt;SLE&gt;TPE) that makes everything still messed up.</p>
