For me, I don't think cefiro has an edge over camry or even the accord in terms of design. That is why you have different cars for different markets. Take the cefiro to europe and it will score sh*t among consumers. No offence to cefiro drivers, but I have seen lots of negative feedback from europeans on the cefiro. Design is just a matter of perspective.<br><br>For the drive, it is also another case of preference. I have driven the cefiro, camry and accord and can honestly say that cefiro and camry just lack the x-factor in its drive albeit both being smooth cruisers with plush seats esp with the cefiro.<br><br>Nonetheless, back to topic, we are comparing sylphy against its competitors which would be civic. Sylphy 2.0 vs Civic 2.0Si. Leave design out, tech wise, I can confidently say the Civic will win hands down.</div>
