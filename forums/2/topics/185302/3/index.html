I'm pleasantly surprised.<br><br>My previous car uses disc brakes, i cannot feel the difference between the current drum brakes and my previous car disc brakes. I had the unfortunate chance to use E.brakes on the CTE! the car in front stop suddenly and i was caught surprised ... fortunately the brakes are very effective!!<br><br>actually to date, I have not gotten use to the foot brake yet. I guess i'm more use to the hand brakes. On steep slopes, i have not tried balancing, anyway i usually just transfer my foot from brakes to accelarator, slide back a little on car park slopes.<br><br></div></blockquote>That is good news! I am considering the new Altis, Mazda 3 and Sylphy. I am currently driving Corolla 1.6 GLi Auto for the past 4.5 years and am very very disappointed with the FC, only 9~10 km/l on Spore road. My previous Civic Sir can do better even after 6 years.<br><br>Sylphy looks ordinary from newspaper. But when I went down to Tan Chong to see the car, I like it except for the drum brake. It is also more pricy (10k more) than Altis. Also, I have not own a NIssan car before. It is always a Honda or a Toyota. But when I brought my family to see Altis and Sylphy, they love Sylphy!<br><br>With yr feedback, that will help a lot in dm. Hope more Sylphy car owners can share a little on their experiences.<br><br>Thanks!</div>

This is just to follow up above message from healthy88.<br>- Mostly I travel from west to city through AYE<br>- I'm a light footer and usually travel on 2nd lane<br>Regarding FC measurement, I found it's rather difficult for me to calculate it based on pomp up basis. This is just to check how much money I spend in owning/or browing in a year.<br><br>Strictly my personal opinion: I found the design of Sylphy is better than my silver coloured civic though the brand image had me choose current one. I may say younger image which i fell fading away now. I may compare my homely wife with my gorgeous ex-gf. At first sight i fall in love with the latter, but eventually i found the former suits me that is not outstanding but keep me well.<br><br>I may write some compaint on civic at civic thread after travelling more.</div>

Using synthetic, i wld not need to come back till 25k, i less trip to serv. leh ...<br><br>btw, i've not update the FC. Actually, it's being pretty consistent on my FC after 10k servicing. I am getting consistently abt 14km/l to 14.5km/l, occasionally hitting above 15km/l. I'm curious if changing to synthetic oil, how much difference in the FC ...</div>
