            <div class='col-md body'>your model is TS. WRX dun have less than 70k onee lah. Also 4-wheel drive. Safety wise of course good. But fuel is not economical. About 8-9km/lit. If both of you like this car, then get it. I sat in one b4, very quiet and comfy. Maintenence wise, i not too sure however...<br>btw, how fast you want to drive?  Spoiler high is for the WRX because racing need to be fast. Your TS model spoiler should be low one. Your hubby want to change high becos some ppl like their TS to look like WRX. Plus that intake somemore, it looks even more like a WRX. PPl who are good can tell from one look even if your hubby change all that spoiler and intake.<br>But i think u better chk first whether that model is TS or WRX first. WRX is 90k above, TS abt 66k.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1.6L is a TS while 2.0litre is a WRX turbo. Which one are you refering to?? In addition which versions are you refering to?? In term of fuel consumption it hovers between 10-12 for 1.6L and 8-11 for WRX turbo.<br><br>In terms of bodykits it do not add to anything in terms of safety. It is more for asethetics outlook. In general, to a guy it may be a tool that bonds himself to the car therfore your husband may find it necessary to change the outlook of the car.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are buying a ts then just leave the car the way it is. there is no shame or disgrace in a 1.6 impreza. it is quite a good car by itself. why do you need to try to make it into a wrx? once you start to do that, you lose the plot. so you add a scoop on top of the bonnet, so you change to huge STI wing, so you bought some guys wrx brakes because he upgraded his to STI brembos, so you bought his sport seat because he bought the STI seats and the STI guy bought a pair of BRIDE seats. you still need to change your dash instruments and the third brake light. do you get my point?? why bother. just stick to your car or if you are so hard up for a wrx, please go ahead and buy one.<br><br>now cheap $84000, because new facelift coming out so must clear stock of old one. but after one month, you are drving old model.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>New Rex at 84K, just bite the bullet and buy it, dun even bother about a second handed one.<br><br>1.6TS, spent a few K on the look fast goodies, and u might as well add another few Ks to get a real Rex. Looks fast and goes fast. Worst thing is to look fast, with go fast attitude and only a yawn inducing 99 bhp at the wheels <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>WRX has 225 bhp VS the TS 99bhp (2.27 times more powerful than the TS), even if u don't know anything about cars, this alone will give u the idea that body apart, they are very different cars.<br><br>Be the real Mc Coy, not another wannabe.</div>
