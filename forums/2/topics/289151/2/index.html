            <div class='col-md body'>well the tunnels in sydney are around 70 to 80KM/H and they charge a toll fee here. The cameras they use here are also digital type like those surveillance cameras you find on MRT platforms so it is hard to beat the system because you it is hard to spot the cameras and there is no telltale sign of camera flash.<br><br>other than that, speed limits in the suburb are around 60KM/H and there are cameras that enforce that here as well. down here big brother is always watching...<br><br>very hard to speed here ar!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If anyone here were the head of LTA, what would you do? One important priority would be to keep thinking of ways to generate revenue for the govt.<br><br>No?<br><br>Motorists often exceed the speed limit w/o even realising it. It is such a chore to watch the speedometer all the time too.<br><br>As reported, 600 motorists were caught speeding daily since the opening of the KPE.<br><br>Assuming an average fine of $120 per case, $600 X $120 = $72000 per day. Multiply that by 365 days will present the govt with an annual revenue of $26,280,000. That's KPE alone.<br><br>Rest assured that there are always innovative ways and more "secret cameras" in more locations. Question that begs now is: Are the fines in place to curb traffic violations or more to generate revenue?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would rather there be dummy cameras placed in obvious positions along all expressways in Singapore.<br><br>It is like a CCTV that deters crime from occuring.<br><br>But then again, if there's this opportunity to generate revenue too, it's like hitting 2 birds with 1 stone. So why not? Problem is too much money is generated at the motorist's expense. Smells of perverse greed here? Maybe that explains why cameras have to be secretly placed.</div>

So you telling me you not complaining why CTE 90km/hr but tunnel is 80km/hr? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div></blockquote>Tell you the truth I always travel 90-100km/h in CTE tunnel when I'm driving alone and if traffic is favourable to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But really lah, travelling at a slow speed doesn't mean you won't get into a bad accident as well. All drivers should generally know that at slow speeds one tends to feel sleepy and lethargic. At higher speeds, a driver is usually more alert and can react to change faster.<br><br>Of course, I'm not saying that one should try to break the sound barrier or what when driving. A range of around 80-90km/h is about fine in an expressway. Speed limit at 70 is just too slow on an expressway man. Face it, there are a lot of people who brake really hard when they see a speed camera and this would cause even more accidents than if traffic was allowed to flow smoothly at a higher speed limit.<br><br>Yes i am not complaining that the CTE speed limits are 80 in tunnel and 90 outside. Why should I? 90 is a reasonable speed limit to me and as for 80, I'm willing to compromise lah. But 70 is just too slow lah. Try driving 70 over a long stretch of road, some of us, eg me, will go nuts man. Here's a reason why SAF drivers should be lauded sometimes as their minibus and landrovers speed limit around 50 only.</div>
