Glad to help. Do be alert and always check blind spot. We are always taught about the blind spot, but never really realise its importance. Only until I experience a whole damn 2000cc car hiding in mine that I understand the logic.<br><br>When parking, go slowly, and keep checking all mirrors. After 3 weeks of driving, I only manage to park without correction 1 fifth of the time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reverse Parking<br><br>For me when I 1st got my car ... i would really observe my car (As in how big) and bear that in mind<br><br>I think this topic is a repeated topic but nvm ... I would suggest you stop at a 45 degree angle to the parking lot (think you know this) ... haha ...<br><br>If you are not confident in getting the car into the lot, GO SLOW and i mean real slow ... Don't worry in blocking others while you are parking (Remember there are experience drivers that took a god damn long time to get into a lot and this might help relieve you alittle)...<br><br>A impt note : Once your rear wheel is in the lot , you are 90% into the lot ... so just go slowly<br><br>*Rear wheel as in if you are reversing into a left lot = Left rear wheel and same for the other direction.<br><br>Please do not try the open door technique and try to just use your mirrors<br><br>Summary : Know the size of your car and go slow if you are unsure<br><br>Cheers<br>nick34</div>

Can adjust angle down until you see the rear wheels and the road.<br>Most cars nowadays have high window sills, so can't see too well when reversing. I have those mirrors and find that knowing where my back wheel is v. useful when parking. And can also see the parking lot lines and whether I am entering the lot properly.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya, the 45 degree is much more easier. the perpendicular which we learn for TP need at least 2 rounds to get in. IMO. juz practice more n go slowly in...<br><br>was wonderin do P platers get horn more often?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> i got horn twice w/o any reasons(at least dun think i pose danger to others) tis is so maddening  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Used to b like u, would always look for empty lots with NO CARS in sight to park. But now i will need to park next to another car as it serves as a gd parking gauge. Like they say, u muz b able to feel the size of ur car &amp; noe the directions of ur wheels (steering &amp; front) when u'r reversing. Always go SLOW &amp; do turn ur head left, right &amp; back to check. Dunno abt the others but when i juz started driving, my side mirrors r often neglected.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   U juz need more practising.<br>By the way, i do live in sengkang/hougang area.
