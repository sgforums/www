When u r afraid to hit th 2 cars from the side, u tend to check ur side mirrors more (side mirror v impt in parkin) and be more careful, so being more careful, u will jus slot ur car in <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. parkin takes lotsa of practices.</div>

Next you have to learn to trust your turn of your steering. You will need to learn at what position is turn at what angle.<br><br>Once you master that you will know how much to turn your steering and thus the angle needed for your car.  One exercise to to get another person to use of hand signal to help you to practise wheel turning from a stationary position.<br>You see, you get him/her to help you practise the various wheel angle turning, then you will soon get the feel of how much to turn your steering. Or you can let it move a little back to know if you overturn or underturn the wheel. Slowly you will get the hang of it. You should take your time to get the best angle which give u the best view from your mirrors and slowly adjust and move in. With practise u do super ... happy driving.<br><br></div>

You are kind of restricted by the angle you can turn, and can turn steering wheel as much as the angle allow only.<br><br>This type of case, you will have to do a few reverse &amp; forward. This mean you have to be handly with your forward and reverse gear.  What you do is to do very gentle 20 degree reverse or as much as the angle allow, move the tail in to the space, the trick is yoru car tail corner position .  You just have to move forward, and do another 20 degree reverse or as much as angle allow. Frankly in some narrow car park, even experience driver , may need as much as 3 reverse to do it, but to other it may seem very fast, because they forward and reverse fast as they are so familiar with their gear and they are familiar how far they can push each reverse angle each time. For you take your time, check to ensure the gear is in reverse or forward carefully, and do it slowly, you will get faster with each time.<br><br>Don't rush it, i have seen people accidently mess up, putting the wrong gear reverse instead of forward, and bang right into a wall.<br></div>
