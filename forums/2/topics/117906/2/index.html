Stop. U can take a look at the mirror. Ur driver side rear should be cleared of obstruction if u reverse straight.<br>3)  Engage reverse and quickly straighten ur tyres... let ur driver side rear enter the lot first... meanwhile look at the left mirror and make sure there is not obstruction.<br>4) At this point of time... those small round mirror which reflect the bottom rear of the vehicle come into use.
