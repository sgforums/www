            <div class='col-md body'>y are those who can pass in the vti but not u? accept it, its the driver's prob, not the car's. understanding and accepting ur weakness is the first step in overcoming a problem. living in denial and blaming constant factors such as the test car only aggravates ur situation. the car, the parking lots and the 3 point turn lots are dead. the driver isn't. knowing when and where to steer ur car as it moves is a fundamental driving skill which requires a constant awareness of ur car's position with respect to its surrounding roads/kerbs. take it positively lah, as much as it sucks 2 pay all dat $$$, failing now and learning from ur mistake is better den getting ur license at ur level now and risk wrecking ur car on a lamppost/kerb/railings or running over a poor pedestrian's toes while he's waiting at the road side 4 u 2 make a 3 point turn. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Because till now you just want to blame it on the car size, and not serious understand that you did not make full use of all mirror to judge your position and take time to think and make adjust before park in .<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe it's because you turned abit too late when you are reversing.. that will cause ur car to be more on the left side of the lot.. try turning abit earlier.. it helps..<br><br>always check ur left and right mirrors to know the position of the car (whether it's more to left or right) before moving out.. if it's on the right.. you can safely turn out (just treat it like ur crank course turning, be confident!).. if it's more to the left (beware! wheels near curb).. steer to the right at low speed before full-locking to the left to turn out..<br><br>if u think there's any chances that you might hit the curb.. remember! don't try your luck.. don't be afraid to do corrective action.. just reverse to get enough space and continue..<br><br>all the best with your next tp.. be confident! good luck..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there're some difference in the turning radius of the exi and vti.. go for the car that you are often practicing with.. it is not about the size of the car but the adaptibility of the driver to the car.. different cars got different profiles (biting point, brakes, accelerator, power, etc etc).. it depends on whether the driver can adapt to the difference and drive like any other cars.. keep ur mind calm.. control the car.. dun let the car control you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually if u just follow the instructions, you won't hit the kerb... i've never encountered any problems when i follow the instructions religiously.<br><br>but then, i can't remember the instructions now la.<br><br>changing to a smaller or bigger car is just giving yourself an excuse.<br><br>here's a situation that I usually gripe about : new drivers after passing try to handle a "bigger" car that they have no ability to handle thus resulting in an accident or death of a fellow motorist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U had seriously lack of confident in bigger car ..and<br>U have not really adapt the correct tactic and enough skill to master the curves .. in this way think you should  do more practicing on your weak points.. and this would help you to overcome your weakness.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't think the problem lies with which car u are driving or which tester u got.<br><br>most of the time is that during the test u either too kan cheong or u too confidence that u forget the actual step. cos i think those learning in sch shld have the step to follow as in when to turn, what to see before u turn etc.. so i think if u really follow it, there is no way they won't pass u. but one thing i feel that the timing of the test is very important. (due to traffic in circuit and main road)<br><br></div>
