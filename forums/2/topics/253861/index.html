            <div class='col-md body'>As stated, careless driving would be the offence I think the driver would be (or have been) charged under.<br><br>I rationalise this on the grounds that driver was not DUI of any substance, and that driver was not speeding nor demonstrated any elements of dangerous driving.<br><br>Furthermore, driver is P plate; lack of experience, judge will be lenient - if driver is young, judge will be more likely to be lenient too.

The reason why he is charged with dangerous driving is because he caused injury. I never considered this because he wasn't speeding nor driving recklessly; he failed to see a traffic light and drove right through. But geez, since TP is taking this stance ... the stakes are much higher now.<br><br>WAIT WAIT, sorry I'm tired, just re read your post and wrote the facts down and analysed this properly; I realised why TP is charging him under this.<br><br>The red light signal was on when your friend drove through. It does not matter that up till that point in time he was driving within the speed limit. When he drove through the junction, he was going &gt;20km/h. He cause injury to a fellow motorist who had right of way.<br><br>You and your friends should stop asking questions online and seek counsel immediately. They will be able to give much clearer advice for which I am not prepared nor equipped to provide.<br><br>EDIT: This is not that straightforward or simple; there are many other factors that have to be accounted for. I'm just roughly and briefly explaining what has happened, and what will likely happen. I think that now that TP has charged him with DD, he'll be lucky to get off without a jail term. As I said, he does have alot of things going in his favour - helping motorist, P plater, young etc.</div>

You can be driving within the speed limit up till the red light junction, but as soon as you run it, and run it &gt;20km/h, you will come within definition of the dangerous driving act, and hence your friend was so charged.<br><br>I doubt very much your friend would be able to have the offence reduced to the lesser charge of careless driving in exchange for entering an admission. Although seeking counsel would increase your chances greatly because counsel can reason based upon what I'm about to say in "2".<br><br>2) In light of the circumstances, I am relatively certain of the following:<br><br>A) The court will be lenient in its ruling against him. He is a P plater, and clearly lacking experience. He is young. Most importantly, he stopped his car and got out of the vehicle to assist the motorcyclist. A submission by the motorcyclist would be of great assistance imo.<br><br>Demonstrating remorse is also a factor that can weigh heavily in the court's ruling. There is no better way to do this than pleading guilty to the offence of dangerous driving. An expert witness's (psychologist/psychiatrist/counsellor) submission would also help.<br><br>B) I believe the court will not be so harsh as to deliver an unfair and unjust ruling; I think the most likely outcome would be a conviction, a fine, costs (that is court fees etc) and loss of his licence. I don't think there will be a jail term. IO statements are usually quite ... accurate predictions ... as they have seen the most of such cases.<br><br>C) As I have said, I very much doubt it will be the end of his future. Companies usually turn a blind eye where the conviction involved is one to do with a traffic offence. In fact, don't lose hope. Use this to your advantage. When going for interviews, sincerely admit past mistakes and explains why it made you a better and more mature person (draw relevance to being ideal for the job).<br><br>Don't get me wrong. I like to help people, especially good people. I'm just a naturally jaded person, hence my replies can seem .... anyway, GOOD LUCK!<br><br>---<br><br>Let me put something into perspective for you. Engaging counsel will not run you more than 10k ... a figure that you could pay off easily in the future; and would be more than worth while for a shot at getting the charge reduced. However, the risk you subject yourself to by not engaging one is immense .. jail term etc.<br><br>Also .. with counsel ... smaller fine + higher costs ... without counsel ... probably larger fine (because they will be able to expertly submit your case).<br><br>Think about this ... conviction without a jail term ... arguably viewed as not so serious ... but a conviction with a jail term ... DEFINITELY viewed negatively. If you are concerned about the future, engage counsel.<br><br>With regards to this, the litigation department of large firms charge competitively while providing large firm experience, and infrastructure (both will assist your counsel, who will in turn assist you greatly).<br><br>I am a big fan of Rodyk and Davidson; one of SG's largest and best firms. They are an excellent firm in all respects. Their litigation department is top notch and they in fact, handle a number of traffic/insurance cases for NTUC. They charge competitively as well. Their lawyers are also very accessible.<br><br>I don't work there and definitely not doing them any favours. Just trying to help, as an anonymous online poster.<br><br>EDIT: I  haven't proof read this lengthy post ... really tired ... if some things don't make sense because of any grammar/spelling/punctuation/fragmentation issues, ask me. Just hope this helps. The legal profession and justice system is full of integrity, and carries the great burden of responsibility with impartiality and professionalism. Don't worry unduely.
