            <div class='col-md body'>First and foremost, any accident with injury requiring ambulance at scene will have the TP or regular blues to come to file report. There in itself, they will ask for ur driving license to check validity..., not because they need ur IC no, same-same as license. When they ask and u say u dun hv it, then tio pok... So just remember to bring to be on the safe side. I dun think that guy will make a report to TP, unless he's a real ass.., in which case scratch his car...</div>

If the other party suspect that u got no licence, tell him to call the police and tell the officer that he suspect that you got no licence and a police car will be dispacted down or on the phone the police will screen for him your driving licence. I understand that during accident if nobody is injured then police won't come down but as mentioned, if he suspect u got no licence then diff case.<br>Few mth back, My frd whose car was knock by a young guy and he suspect that the other party does not have a valid driving licence and my frd called the police and the reply from the police is, they screen the driving licence for him cos the other party got bring IC and so the police didn't come down.<br>If no IC and no Licence they police will come down. However under the NRA act, it is not an offence not to bring out your NRIC. During police spot check, if u got no NRIC, u can gave the police your NRIC num verbally unless the police suspect that u r giving him a fake NRIC num then they can bring you back to Police stn and wait for your family member OR someone to bring down your NRIC or other form of Singapore Goverment issued ID.<br></div>
