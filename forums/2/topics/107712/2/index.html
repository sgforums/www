Anyway, does your job require you to drive? If yes, you can use that as a pleading point. But remember, that speeding is stupid not because your licence will be gantung but because it can really kill you so if you ever get your licence back to drive, please dun make the same mistakes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>135km/hr really isn't that fast , unfortunately he chose to do it on Singapore roads.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  With the TP's on the prowl, it really does not pay to speed, guess he learnt the hard way.<br><br>Probably a $800 fine and liscense suspension <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Problem is the TP will make it very hard for such candidates to pass the test again....as they are black-marked already. He does need to seriously consider what to do with his car.<br><br>The speed camera (hand held) is very capable of clocking cars well over 250km/hr. I was driving my cousin's Brabus C3.8 and we were into 280 km/hr and yes the Malaysian Police managed to clocked us. If the Malaysians can do it, Singapore will probably have the same capabilities.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is siok to step on  the accelerator on a straight rd.<br><br>I hd the same kind of experience few years back , while i am driving my veh on the PIE(Tuas) at around 1000hrs. It was free of traffic at that time and i hd a quick glance at the rear mirror to chk for any TP. After confirmation that there r no TP , i step the pedal slowly until it reaches 120 km/h. I can tell u that the feeling is damn siok. For 10 min i was driving this speed and out of a sudden a TP appear on my left side of window and signal me to stop. Shit!! I was totally mad of myself but was too late. This was my first and the last i tell myself, cos i hv maintained a clean sheet since i got my licence 4 yrs 11mths liao going to 5yrs but i just blew it. It was my unlucky day for me.<br>The TP said that i was speed at 110km/h and fined $150/-.<br><br>I tell myself not to drive for a yr to play safe so that my pts will be restored back to normal.<br>Pls don't do not speed  in S'pore,it is not worth it. If u want to hv a feel of speed u can always go to malaysia racing circuit. As u r paid to speed whatever u like nobody will book u for that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>P-plate drivers pls take care yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

U take your eyes off the speedo for about... 5 seconds, and u'll prob be at 100km/h already... b4 we find out exactly why he was speeding, dun straightaway accuse him of doing the above highlighted. I mean, if u were levelling such an accusation at me, I would agree, because honestly that is true for me... but he hasn't explained himself yet, so I think its only fair to hear what he has to say for himself?</div>
