I can understand a bit... I got caught doing 90 along a 50 rd..... narrowly avoided a court case. it was 3am and i was rushing to NTU to pick a friend up after having just picked another fren up. That was like my 2nd last nite in SG b4 I leave for UK, hence my 2 best buddies were bugging me to go out with them for one last group meal in a long time... anyways, good luck for your case.</div>

I'm sure lots here will offer support if it is.<br>In fact, we are trying to put a message across. Even you scolded him when you heard, and you are his GF.<br><br>Imagine this scenario, say a girl not feeling well and is expected her BF to come to take care of her. She waited and waited, but the BF never turn up. Later she found out that her BF was involved in an serious accident on the way over. Apparantly it's the other party's fault and he was speeding.<br>You think it'll be a comfort to the girl why the other party is speeding, that he's also rushing to see his unwell GF?<br>Hope you don't take this as a personal attack, juz trying to put things in perspective why some comments are unsympathetic.<br><br>Peace</div>

We dont support things that are not right, like speeding, reckless driving as these endanger the lives of fellow motorist. If the driver gets into trouble, he has himself to blame but just think what if due to his actions other people get into trouble. Maybe you want to reach home in a quicker time but by doing so jepadorise other people lifes. Can you live with it for the rest of your life?</div>
