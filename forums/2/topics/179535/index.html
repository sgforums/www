            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>I would like to know what's the average waiting time between getting the COE and taking delivery of the new car <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>I booked a new car last month, and the salesman said that he has obtained an open cat COE for me in the first week of february. But when i asked him what's the value of the COE that he has gotten, he kept saying that he does not know. And he says must wait till at least March before I can get the car.<br><br>I called him several times and he kept saying that they have to 'prepare' the car, send for polishing etc. This is already the last week of Feb and i'm wondering, what's taking them so long? No news of registration, no request for my i/c, whatsoever.<br><br>Is it normal to have to wait for 1 month+ (or more) between getting the COE and taking delivery of the car, or is the salesman/company playing punk with me?? Are they holding on to my deposit, hoping that they can secure a lower COE in subsequent biddings (since contractually, they have 6 tries)? Hmmm...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What i know is, if they have ready stocks than once the next COE bidding is over, they will be able to give you ur car in 7 to 10 working days. Tell your SE , no matter how bad the Q in LTA to reg ur new car, it could be done in 1 day, if the Q is so bad, go early to do lah, dont tell me by the time LTA office close they can't clear the Q and ask plp to leave meh.</div>
