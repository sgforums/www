            <div class='col-md body'>I rented a toyota Ipsum when i was touring with my friends in Japan and it was fitted with a navigation system commonly known as a Navi or Navigator over there. Without that system, let me tell you, there will be no way tat me and friends will be able to travel around Japan from Osaka to Kyushu then to Tokyo without getting lost. It is like a saviour for any drivers who does not have the faintest idea of the area around them.<br><br>Even though the entire system is in jp, it wasn't hard for us to get the hang of it. The entire road map of Japan from southern kyushu all the way to the northern island of hokkaido has been drawn in the system along with the important landmarks. For our part, we will first have to locate on the digitalise map, where is the location we are going. Once the location is found on the map, we will set that point as our point of destination and the software will automatically draw a red path that would lead us to there in the shortest distance. Every time we drive along that path, it will keep updating itself to show us where is our current location and which path to take next. If we take a wrong path(even though its already clearly marked on the map to turn right instead of left), the system will automatically redraw a new set of path base on our current location that would lead us to our destination. Once you know how to play around with the controls, you will hardly ever get lost. It is GOOD!<br><br>Having this system is like having a talking street directory next to you. You tell her you are going to xxxx and she will tell you exactly when to turn right, when to turn left.(in fact, to make sure drivers do not take their eyes off the streets when using this system, the system will automatically narrate out that you are about to approach a turn and you need to turn right/left. In Japanese of course -_-) It even has important landmarks, shopping malls, convienient stores, fast food chains, car parks, petrol kiosk, public toilets, etc displayed as icons on the maps to help you incase you need them.<br><br>Thank goodness for this baby. It has to be the greatest joy I found while driving in Japan, the 2nd greatest joy was discovering highways drivethru and what I can find in each of them.<br><br>I will never buy one in Singapore. Singapore is too small for you to get hopelessly lost. It will be useful only when you are driving in large countries and travelling across states.</div>
