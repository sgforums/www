            <div class='col-md body'>You can try grounding the car. Or use better synthetic engine oil. Normally it is difficult to reduce FC if the car already has high FC to start off with. At extreme cases, people sell off their high FC car after 3 years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's some methods that can help you improve the FC of your Sunny:<br><br>a. Don't overload the boot. Get rid of unnecessary stuff except spare tyre.<br>b. If driving manual, try to keep rpm below 2000 (that will gives you 70-75km cruising speed) in 5th gear.<br>c. Try the 1-3-5 gear shift method(this is strictly for highway driving to attain the highway speed asap). Lesser gear change means less high rev for the engine and is good for the FC.<br>d. Switch off engine when waiting for more than 5 minutes.<br>e. When going down hill, release accelerator or maintain same pressure (the extreme type will move to neutral gear but try not to if you are a new driver)<br>f. Plan your route before you set off. Highway driving will usually gives you better returns on FC than urban driving even though the urban route maybe shorter. Remember, more frequency of gear change means higher FC. Always use the next higher gear where possible( the lower the rpm is maintain, the better the FC)<br><br>Special: Switching to netural gear to save petrol<br>Most people will swtich to neutral when going down hill or crusing to a traffic light stop. I do that too (I even switch off the engine when struck in a bad jam). Mentally it makes you believe you are saving petrol but actually no difference lah. You have to brake nore and sometimes when you re-engage, you may damgae the gear box as you may have selected the wrong gear.<br><br>I used to own a Nissan Sunny SS model(N16)manual and the FC is 525km for 55 litres(full tank). The auto I heard only returns 330km.</div>
