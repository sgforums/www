            <div class='col-md body'>Last night I was driving on the ECP towards the east at about 7pm, the portion from Benjamin Sheares Bridge, descending on a slope towards the Fort Road exit, many cars were travelling haltingly. There was a Lexus RX300 travelling behind me, and an Indian lady was behind the steering wheel with an old man next to her. The car in front of me slammed the brakes, and so I followed suit. The Indian almost lost control of her vehicle as she was picking up speed on the downslope, and I could see the vehicle veering to the left, almost sending the Vios on her left slamming to the left, cascading the impact sidewards.<br><br>In my mind, I was thinking: What the hell was she trying to do? Why step on the accelerator when u are travelling downslope??<br><br>Oh yeah. The drivers nowadays. When they crash, blame themselves.</div>

However, they really should learn that they are vunerable themselves... a good 90% (seems to me anyway) of bikers here think they are made of steel.  Weaving through traffic, cutting dangerously infront of cars... squeezing inches between cars travelling at 80, 90, 100 km/h on the highway, etc.<br><br>Too many times I had to hit my brakes at traffic lights when they turn green, cause some biker shot between cars and cut right in front of me as I was moving off.<br><br>These bikers are nothing more than road casualties waiting to happen.  It's always easy to blame the driver cause he's protected in his car while they are out in the open on 2 wheels.  People should realize though that the driver is not always to blame.<br><br>Just to clarify,  I do have a class 2 license on as well as my class 3.  I was always thought right from my Class 2B, 2A and 2 lessons to behave as a full vehicle on the road and stay in my lane, signal when required.  Not to squeeze through traffic which is not only dangerous, but illegal.   Bikers here don't seem to want to do that though...  9 out of 10 times they are to blame for their own accidents even if they do get the brunt of the collision.</div>
