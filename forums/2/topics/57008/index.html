Resulting in lighter overall body weight which will improve overall handling, easier pickup performance and etc.<br><br>Design Kit:-<br>Just mainly for design and looks only. Like eg. A Lancer GLX with a body kit of EVO7. Outlook looks like evo7 but it's only a GLX.<br><br>Also refering to your previous post on the picture of the two specific guage:-<br><br>The lower guage is Boost guage. Show's you how much power you got from your booster (refering to either supercharger or tubro depends on what you're using)<br><br>The upper guage, if i'm mistaken, should be EGT guage.<br><br>Hope that's answer your question.<br></div>

Excessive backpressure is created when the throttle is closed during gear changes or deceleration, causing turbo cavitation. This is detrimental to the life of your turbocharger; however fitting a BOV will substantially improve this problem.<br><br>By installing a BOV you will significantly reduce turbo spool up time. You will notice a substantial improvement in response from your turbo between gearshifts. Boost will come on earlier giving an increase in torque at lower RPM<br><br>The vast majority of turbo owners fit aftermarket blow off valves simply for the signature noise that they make between gearshifts. While that may be reason enough to fit one, they do actually serve a more important purpose than that. A common misconception is that if a turbocharged car doesn't make a "whoosh" noise, it doesn't have a blow-off valve. Almost every modern turbo car will have some form of blow-off valve, except that the vented air is returned to the inlet tract before the turbo to muffle the sound.<br>A good analogy for what happens in a turbo system when you close the throttle is water hammer in household pipes when you turn the tap off too quickly. The same thing happens when your turbo is spinning at about 100,000 RPM, pumping pressurized air into the engine. When the throttle butterfly snaps shut for a gearshift, that air (which can be traveling at up to 90 meters per second) has nowhere to go except back the way it came and out through the turbo. This is bad for a number of reasons. First, slowing the turbo from maximum RPM to practically zero in less than a second is obviously going to place a lot of strain on the turbo. Secondly, since the turbo has stalled, the lag when you open the throttle again is increased.<br><br>The BOV is designed to release excess pressure under these conditions to allow the turbo to freewheel, which both prevents damage and reduces lag. The noise is achieved simply by venting the air externally.<br><br>You take a look here on some varies types of BOVs:<br><a href="http://nextcollection.com/html/Auto_Performance2.cfm?category=Blow%20Off%20Valve&amp;Department=Auto%20Performance" rel="nofollow">http://nextcollection.com/html/Auto_Performance2.cfm?category=Blow%20Off%20Valve&amp;Department=Auto%20Performance</a><br><br>Hope this helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>matrix. thanks for the reply...it was what i was looking for but maybe too detailed...THANKS<br>one more question. if a car is stock, what most effective tune up part can he modifiy or install to boast the car's performance?<br>then, air intake is to allow car to enter the entire car's engine and cool it right? then intercooler or a radiator, isn't it the same as a air intake?</div>

Function to reduce engine Temperature (prevent overheating if you intend to drag your engine).<br><br>An intercooler/air intake (or charge air cooler) is an component that looks something like a radiator, except air passes through the inside as well as the outside of the intercooler. The intake air passes through sealed passageways inside the cooler, while cooler air from outside is blown across fins by the engine cooling fan.<br>It increases the power of the engine by cooling the pressurized air coming out of the compressor before it goes into the engine<br><br>Tips:-<br>1. Change your computer chip -- sometimes, but certainly not always, you can change a car's performance by changing the ROM chip in the engine control unit (ECU). You usually buy these chips from aftermarket performance dealers. It is valuable to read an independent review of the chip you are contemplating, because some chips are all hype and no performance.<br><br>2. Let air come in more easily - As a piston moves down in the intake stroke, air resistance can rob power from the engine. Some newer cars are using polished intake manifolds to eliminate air resistance there. Bigger air filters and reduced intake piping can also improve air flow.<br><br>3. Let exhaust exit more easily - If air resistance or back-pressure makes it hard for exhaust to exit a cylinder, it robs the engine of power. If the exhaust pipe is too small or the muffler has a lot of air resistance then this can cause back-pressure. High-performance exhaust systems use headers, big tail pipes and free-flowing mufflers to eliminate back-pressure in the exhaust system.<br><br>4. Cool the incoming air - Compressing air raises its temperature. You would like to have the coolest air possible in the cylinder because the hotter the air is the less it will expand when combustion takes place.<br><br>Hope this what you looking for <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Honda) 4 the transmission change and it's gonna cost alot... might as well buy a Manual transmission car unless u have no choice cos the car only has auto (e.g Mercedes)</div>
