            <div class='col-md body'>I believe most of the car owner here had already receive the new SINGAPORE ACCIDENT STATEMENT FORM from your insurance companies.<br><br>The form had to be filled by ourselves at scene??? Imagine filling up the long winded form along the expressway shoulder may endanger ourselves and cause traffic jam.  In that case, what is the point of having the IDAC centre to report traffice accident.<br><br>Form to be filled and acknowledge by both parties <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> What if these are a mass collision and not a typical straight chain collision?  We can be "SMART", but not act "SMART" for such situation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is just another stupid procedure. Imagine involved in an accident, you are all tensed up and suffering from shock and yet you have to fill a form for the insurance company??<br><br>What kind of crap is that?? I don't think those involved in the accident would even be in the right frame of mind to report what had actually happened. Maybe some of us here might consider writing our feedbacks to the newspapers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The form is meant to assist any1 who gets into a traffic accident to write down the relevant stuff... Many people, after being involved with an accident, either gets too flustered or too shocked that they just can't think properly what are the correct details to note down, hence the form comes in handy so that u've gotten enough details to report an accident or file for an insurance claim</div>

With such an enforcement, there won't be such slip-ups.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Tarvo:</div><div class="quote_body">I don't think those involved in the accident would even be in the right frame of mind to report what had actually happened.</div></blockquote>Like what Tarvo said, those involved in an accident would not be in the right frame of mind, hence do u think that u can still relate the incident ages after u leave the accident scene? The mind would only vaguely remember what happened, but to file a report, it can't be vague and ambigious. Although the form is not the best method, but I'm sure it beats having to try to think and recall what are the details that u have to take note of after u got into an accident.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, maybe after abt 4 or 5 accidents, ppl wld be able to rem to fill up the form after the accident. Aniwae, the form is pretty useless. Most ppl wld jus twist n turn e facts till it seems like the werent e one at fault even though they're.<br>So jus put a disposable camera in e car, get ready to take pics rite after accidents lor. easier.</div>
