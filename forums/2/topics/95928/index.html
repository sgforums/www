No one will also buy the BMW 745i when you have the 520. No one will buy Accord/Civic when you have City.<br><br>Buying a second-hand car has its merits if you are sure of the quality of the car. Bear in mind that it's an asymmetric-information situation where the seller knows more about the car than the would-be buyer. There is a risk of adverse selection.<br><br>Just make sure you don't get it from unscrupulous second-hand dealers.<br><br>Cars are relatively cheap now, so it does not make sense to go for 2nd hand ones. Save all your headaches. Read about the woman who paid $78k for her second hand Stream only to get one problem after another?</div>

So, his conculsion is that while buying a matrix is indeed have a higher FC but the total cost in the end is still more than those VTEC, VVTI cars.<br><br>Another thing abt korean is dun expect good resell value.
