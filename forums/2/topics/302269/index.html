I even wrote to the police.  As there was any injuries and damage to public property, police don't care.  Merely advise me to take civil suit againt the driver..  How much is the lawyer going to cost  against the repair cost of over $2k.. . .  not worth right ...   that idiot in AIG somemore say look like 50/50 fault.  They don't even call to check or ask and assumme I am at 50% fault !!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One lorry incident also happened to my gf. AIG just plain sucks.<br><br>Another incident is while driving, a car suddenly dashed out from a minor lane without stopping. Then my gf cannot stop in time. It is obvious that the other driver is at fault; he didn't stop at the stop line to give way to major lane at all.<br>But both cars are insured under AIG. After refusing a 60% liability by the other driver, it was subsequently increased to 70% and then 80%. After that, there was suddenly no news, then a letter came from AIG saying the case has been closed. Yet the matter was not settled!<br><br>My dad's advice was, quit AIG and go to some other insurance company. And my conclusion is, AIG sucks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually for all insurance claims it works like this.

After I kpkb, they called and explained that they are now waiting for the lawyer to recover my excess.. if they succeed at at least 80% claim, then they will refund me the NCD..

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro,<br><br>U r not the only one here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  My car collected less than a month suffered a severed left ear all thanks to an arsehol lorry driver. We were both turning right at a T junction, this bloke in Lane 2 (center lane) oversteer into my lane at Lane 1 (right-most lane). Unable to stop in time, my car's left ear snapped. Luckily enuf that I managed to evade body contact so repair cost wise didn't suffer too much.<br><br>In his right wing mirror, I saw him issuing the apologizing signal when he was stuck in between 2 lanes. After I alerted him of the accident that he had already caused, he stepped out accusing me of swerving into his lane when we both pulled to a corner and stepped out for settlement. Because that is his company's lorry, he basically told me that he will not do anything, ask me to go n claim my own insurance. I got so mad that I called his boss to discuss, the most infuriating thing was that, I didn't take any photo of the accident scene. In my mind I was only trying to ascertain if there were any injuries to motorists around me and quick make way to the corner in order not to obstruct the traffic flow. Luckily I've managed to secure a witness who's also my colleague. If we didn't plan to go meet our customer that day and so happened that I dunno the way, I wouldn't have followed his tail closely and he wouldn't be able to witness my accident. Hmmm....maybe put it another way, if I never agreed to go meet that customer with him that day, I might have evaded the whole accident all in total haha...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The sight of that truck driver trying to reverse the entire story makes me so mad that I wouldn't hesitate to make his life miserable if I have the money to. I have since repaired and paid, now waiting for the claim result against his insurance. Now I'll stay far far from company trucks and goods vehicles man, 1 lesson is enuf. Another point learned is to be selfish and go ahead obstruct the traffic until I get my photos and witnesses ready before I free up the lanes. Else, seriously in SG, no one will step out of their cars and offer their help to your cause. I'm utterly disappointed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
