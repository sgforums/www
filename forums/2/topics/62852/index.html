            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Braddell-Lornie flyover on the cards, says LTA </strong><br><br>It's to ease possible congestion near Mount Alvernia Hospital when Braddell-Bishan flyover opens fully<br><br>FIRST, the part of Braddell Road where it meets the Central Expressway (CTE) was turned into an underpass to ease the jam there.<br><br>Farther down, where Braddell Road meets Bishan Road, work is ongoing on a flyover to bypass this bottleneck.<br><br>The CTE-bound lanes of this flyover opened last Saturday.<br><br>But when the flyover is fully open next year, Braddell Road traffic may pile up near Mount Alvernia Hospital and also near MacRitchie Reservoir.<br><br>So, another flyover linking Braddell Road to Lornie Road over these two junctions is possible, says the Land Transport Authority (LTA).<br><br>It's on the drawing board, said LTA's director of engineering, Mr Lim Bok Ngam, and the tender could be called next year.<br><br>He disclosed this to The Straits Times in the course of discussing two other road improvement projects, both completed, that some have considered questionable.<br><br>One is the 'underused' Upper Serangoon viaduct between Upper Aljunied Road and Yio Chu Kang Road, which was opened in February last year.<br><br>It carries about 1,400 vehicles an hour towards Hougang during the evening peak period. That is likely to rise when more homes are developed in the north-east region, Mr Lim said.<br><br>Why did they not wait till then? Because doing it will be technically tougher and more costly.<br><br>Instead, they chose to build it at around the same time as the North-East Line tunnel which runs directly underneath. The viaduct passes over the Braddell-Bartley underpass at Upper Serangoon Road.<br><br>Some motorists have also complained that when the underpass and a flyover linking Upper Bukit Timah Road to Clementi Road opened in March this year, traffic along Jalan Anak Bukit was still bad for months.<br><br>Mr Benny Tan, 40, said that though he does not use the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE), he still has to contend with all the traffic taking the slip road leading off Jalan Anak Bukit and linking to the PIE.<br><br>Just getting through this sometimes takes him 10 minutes, he said.<br><br>The slip road was widened only late last month.<br><br>The LTA said that traffic flow did improve after the flyover and underpass opened, just not enough.<br><br>But why couldn't LTA engineers pre-empt the problem?<br><br>They had studied computer predictions of the traffic flow after the changes, but drivers can behave unpredictably, Mr Lim said.<br><br>'It takes a few months to reach equilibrium,' he explained, as some motorists will try out the route for novelty's sake.<br><br>No matter how the LTA improves the road system, motorists will still have to put up with 'slight traffic congestion', Mr Lim said.<br><br>The LTA spends between $200 million and $300 million a year on road developments, and Mr Lim expects this level of spending to be maintained for the next five to 10 years.<br><br>'In the future, getting money to build roads will be a challenge,' he said, because road projects now bring 'incremental and not obvious' improvements compared to decades ago when the network was not as developed.<br><br>He added: 'While people aspire to own cars, the challenge is to encourage them to try not to drive during peak hours.'<br><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">extracted from STI</span></span></div>
