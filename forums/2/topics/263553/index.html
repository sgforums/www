GDI drink fuel most avr can get 11km/l compared to GLX avr 13km/l. Personally i think a car has its pros and cons. however when buying a car, the buyer will look more on the pros and cons and ultimately it his choice on whether to buy it or not.<br><br>to me, i prefer lancer over sunny and vios in terms of sporty looks, sunny over them both for comfort, vios over them both in terms of perfomance esp power and fuel economy. this is a bit of comparison made la, but there are other factors as well that will influence other users...<br><br>i've driven all 3 cars before and i know how each car feels and how they perfomed.<br><br>TS, congrats on ur new baby!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People buy car already no need be so impolite...<br><br>Anyway, TS, do check your wipers and windows as well. Such things very easy to screw up. Sometimes too advance electronics also abit overdone.<br><br>Otherwise, enjoy your new car. Lancer is a pretty good car. Looks good and handle pretty well. Although I still prefer Euro cars but from what I've driven, Lancer is pretty fine for Sg roads.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Lancer is quite good actually. Had a ride in my friend's Lancer Auto recently. The ride is well-controlled though not as supple as a, say, Corolla Altis. But at least that means it rolls less than the Altis in a turn/corner.<br><br>Engine also quite powerful, but gearbox is a little fidgety. But maybe that's because my friend floored the accelerator. Smooth upshifts is possible. I also have no complains about space at the back, it is quite on par with the Altis the benchmark.<br><br>There's a reason why now Lancer is now the best selling car in Singapore. Surpassing even the venerable Corolla Altis. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys. greetings to all, usually i quite inactive in this forum. Anyway islancer really that bad?? i just booked a lancer too, should be collecting next Sat I booked a lancer sports munual. It is my first ride, so quite excited!!!<br><br>Anyway i test drive the vehicle, it feels quite good actually. Thou i would agree the pick up is not as fast as a vios.  FC should be ard 13-14km/L if u r light footed. The only complain that i have is the interior looks a little plain. But all in all for a the price i stil think it is a very worthy buy.</div>
