It's his duties to ensure u know everything b-4 u actually has ur TP.<br>Anyway, regarding ur qns:<br>1) I assume u wants to make an U-turn while u still driving on the road right? First, u hav to let go ur accelarator &amp; step on brake lightly if u think that the car is going too fast, try to to control the speed as slow as u can prob 10-15km/hr if not wrong. No need to use the half clutch unless u stop at the traffic junction, then u hav to use half clutch method &amp; fully release ur clutch when u completes ur u-turn.<br><br>2) U can use half clutch when u just start moving ur car. Drive as normal as in slow &amp; steady &amp; change ur gear to 2nd subsequently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alamak ! You have to feel the engine rev and the amount of clutch you let let go, so that the car is smooth.  Maybe, just remember to wear a super short skirt, that might take the tester attention away from your driving Hehehe..<br>I maybe joking, but I do know of an actually happening back at the old Queenstown centre more than 10 years ago. My cousin (female, 25 at that time) pass her second attempt with her mini skirt, throughout the test she was showing her panties to the tester, it was intentional, her instuctor had informed her that a particular tester at the centre, if you give him that signal and don't bother to cover up the license is yours.  So she was game enough to dress in a Mini skirt and it so happened that she got that tester.  The instructor told my cousin it was him as he was holding on to the test plate and walking toward my cousins car. So, she straight away had to put on a show, she told us her story after she got the license, that when he walk to her side of her car to check her provisional license and test paper, she had by than pull her skirt up and her crotch of her panties was showing as she sat with her legs parted.  He than without coming into the car instructed my cousin to move to the back of the carpark to do her reverse parking. All this while he was standing next to her car and looking into it at her parted legs.<br><br>She soon know that he was interested, and started give him more.  She told us that throughout the driving on the road and doing all the various 3 point turns and emergency stop. He kept looking at her skirt and pretending to writing on the chipboard he was holding. My cousin had also along the way lifted her skirt higher and much of her crotch and panties could be seem, he was enjoying it and just before returning to the centre, turn toward my cousin and looked straight up her skirt and continue looking and kept smiling, my cousin actually opened her legs more and lift her  skirt up and show him her full front view. He immediately told my cousin she passed, and can return to the centre and get her license. But he was very professional about it, no touching and asking for favours, not even asking for phone numbers. He just wants to look at panty covered CB.<br><br>Might worth a try if you are desperate.</div>
