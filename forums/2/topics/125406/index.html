I heard the notion that we shld always wait for the 1 year period before buying the car...however I really need that car this year.<br><br>Yeh, Maintainence wise, I really don't know what to do about taht....<br><br>I'm thinking of getting the 320 one, as the fuel consumption is really good 7l/100 combined cycle, and I'm not going to be racing this car.
