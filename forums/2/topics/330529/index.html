              <p>ok, on thursday, i was driving 2 forumers and myself to geylang to have some dim sum for dinner, and when after we 'drive thru', i drove back la. and since the people who have went to geylang before would know about the 24/7 heavy traffic, if wanna join to the main road have to æ•¢æ•¢ step up abit of the accelerate pedal, to give a little boost to the main road.</p>
              <p>then, i saw that the car that i overtook is some ah beng driver, who is about the same age as me, about early 20s behind me. he looks dissatisfied that i overtook him, and his posture is ridiculous, something like this</p>
              <p><img src="http://i33.tinypic.com/imovgx.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>head tilted one side, and one hand on the steering, its true! i really saw it, its like he is screaming for " LOOK AT MY COOL CAR WITH NEON NIGHTS EVERYWHERE, I LOOK SO COOL WITH MY TILTED HEAD AND THIS POSTURE IS A CHICK MAGNET", added with the typical ah beng someone-owe-him-a-million kind of expression</p>
              <p>the 2 forumers and me laughed over his face over the rear mirror, which we can see very very clearly his not-happy face</p>
              <p>then, maybe he was angry or something, tailgated me super super near for about 3 mins, and eventually saw the last lane empty, and just zoomed off us, and when he overtook me, he turned to look at me also, like a quick glare at me</p>
              <p>im not pissed, but amused, amused at the initial-d/maximum tuned wannabes who just got a p-plate and screaming for attention. who knows, maybe he dont even have a licence</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and guess the car he is driving, Hyundai Getz</p>

              <p>ok, on thursday, i was driving 2 forumers and myself to geylang
              to have some dim sum for dinner, and when after we 'drive thru', i
              drove back la. and since the people who have went to geylang before
              would know about the 24/7 heavy traffic, if wanna join to the main
              road have to æ•¢æ•¢ step up abit of the accelerate pedal, to give a
              little boost to the main road.</p>
              <p>then, i saw that the car that i overtook is some ah beng driver,
              who is about the same age as me, about early 20s behind me. he
              looks dissatisfied that i overtook him, and his posture is
              ridiculous, something like this</p>
              <p><img src="http://i33.tinypic.com/imovgx.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>head tilted one side, and one hand on the steering, its true! i
              really saw it, its like he is screaming for " LOOK AT MY COOL CAR
              WITH NEON NIGHTS EVERYWHERE, I LOOK SO COOL WITH MY TILTED HEAD AND
              THIS POSTURE IS A CHICK MAGNET", added with the typical ah beng
              someone-owe-him-a-million kind of expression</p>
              <p>the 2 forumers and me laughed over his face over the rear
              mirror, which we can see very very clearly his not-happy face</p>
              <p>then, maybe he was angry or something, tailgated me super super
              near for about 3 mins, and eventually saw the last lane empty, and
              just zoomed off us, and when he overtook me, he turned to look at
              me also, like a quick glare at me</p>
              <p>im not pissed, but amused, amused at the initial-d/maximum tuned
              wannabes who just got a p-plate and screaming for attention. who
              knows, maybe he dont even have a licence</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and guess the car he is driving, Hyundai Getz</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>So you have skill lah, drive commercial vehicle yet can easily overtake a Getz. I hope you're not one of the Fiats hogging the second or first lane on the expressway. Pushing at 80km, breaking down in cold sweat at 90 or 100 before other vehicles are forced to overtake left and right.</p>
              <p>So far, the geylang method for night driving is send a high beam first then
              turn out, it usually works, then switch off after joining main road.</p>

              <p>Heh, I stereotype drivers based on their vehicle choice one mah.</p>
              <p>mazda3, mercedes, especially rx300 are mostly safe drivers.</p>
              <p>Most toyota and honda mpvs, honda fit and mitsubitshi colt are accidents waiting to happen, it's only a matter of time. If you look at the way many honda fits operate on the expressway and tunnels, they drive like it's F1.</p>
              <p>I almost kenah hamburger by 3 honda civic in town so I'm under the impression all honda drivers are very SL.</p>
