              <p>Hmm according to my instructor and the theory?...</p>
              <p>You should use engine brake at all possible time to prevent brake fade or something...</p>
              <p>For me, when I see then traffic light at junction is red and I'm at 4th gear, after I gauge the distance required and reached it, I will immediately engage 3rd gear without stepping on brake.The car will start to slow itself down.</p>
              <p>Then when I  going to reach the third arrow (approximate will do, no need to stare at the road for arrow lol) before the stopping line, I will engage 2nd gear then at the same time step brake, if required, until the car reach the stopping line.</p>
              <p>After that, I will engage first gear and step at the brake to prevent any sudden moving.</p>
              <p>That's what my instructor told me to do.</p>
              <p>Well, if I have no time to shift gear to use engine break due to traffic light suddenly change, then I just step on the brake till it stop at the stopping line.</p>

              <p>confirm use engine brake and stop is the correct way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>of course U have to see how U use ur engine brake and how much distance U have...example if U are at 4th gear...traffic lights turn red...U change down to 1st year and use engine brake...confirm the braking effect will be strong mah...so U either change down to 3rd gear and stop or U brake a bit to slow down the speed a little before changing down to 3rd gear or U can clutch in...change to 3rd gear...get bitting point...get a little braking effect and then clutch in again...change to 2nd gear and repeat the proces....its all how much distance U have and how well U know ur gears...U need to develop feelings for it.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>crank course is okay but not so okay for s course.</p>
              <p>anyone can give me some tip anot?</p>
              <p>on the road I am above average except I tend to lag behind the
              car in front of me and my car usually is closer to the centre line,

              <p>parallel parking - There is always the "formula" method that the instructors will teach...just follow that...maybe what I want to add is that ur low speed control is also important for the "formula" to work...have to practise and make sure U can repeat the "formula" to a T.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what's ur problem with S-course?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lagging behind neber mind since U are learner driver and U need to be within the speed limit.if the road in front is clear..U can go up to the speed limit(obviously not over lar)...if there is a car in front...just make sure U leave a safe distance between.U can use the 2-second rule to help if it works for U.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>personally I hate drivers who dont keep to the centre of the lane so pls go and ask ur instructor on how to make sure ur car is in the centre...usually they have a point that U can refer to when driving(eg the wiper nozzle in the centre of the lane when U look at it from ur driver seat)...go ask ur instructor about it...ur height/car models/instructor styles  will vary...if not U can just use the side mirrors and see that the spacing at both sides(dotted line/kerb) are about the same.</p>

              <p>lol... I learned a total of 31 practical lessons, spending
                  2K+.</p>
              <p>The TP test will be upcoming tuesday morning. Not much
                  confidence to tell you the truth, since my driving skill like
                  cannot make it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>But I hope I can pass.</p>
              <p>P.S - First timer.</p>
              <p> Some Problems:</p>
              <p>1) Driving sometime too near to road side.</p>
              <p>2) Turning too late, thus become too sharp (90 degrees) My
                  instructor will say "you think you are doing crank course ar?"

              <p>3) Sometime never check blind spot or rear view mirror</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Justing seeing the above problem, I think cannot make it liao.

                  Hmm, I cap myself at 50km/h for main road and about 40km/h for

              <p>Ya... Been trying to correct it, though sometime habits still pop out. No time to worry liao since tomorrow is my TP test, just hope I can concentrate 100% on the road since sometime I have a habit of dazing off (mind drifting away after driving for too long) because too tired or something. &lt;-- Someone gonna flame me for this and I admit its quite abit of problem.</p>

              <p>@Xcert: I actually did what you described, but the only difference is that i didnt remain at half-clutch for 3rd gear before changing to gear 2. I'm not allowed to do so. The instructor told me that I should'nt use half-clutch for 2nd and 3rd gear onwards, this includes braking.</p>
              <p>I will be having my driving lesson later on at 1.30pm and I'll try your method. I think the problem is that I'm changing down gears at too high a speed, thus the intense engine braking.</p>
