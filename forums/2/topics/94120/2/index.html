The bore spacing, block design, cylinder head design, even the oil filter location are the same. You can actually interchange several cylinder head parts between the F and K series.<br>The engines aren't the same, but they're close<br><br>s2000s max rpm is about 9000rpms(not 10k) but the cluster has 10k on it, you never get there on a stock s2000 anyways<br><br>the us spec INTEGRA RSX gets the k20c with produces 200 hp @ 7400rpms<br>the stock redline never reaches 10k for the f20 (jap spec or not) but jap spec produces more hp (250 compared to 240) due to higher octane fuel in japan<br><br>and no spoon does not participate in the JGTC series<br>Super Taikyu endurance  is what the spoon car does<br><br>i have never seen an s2000 in the JGTC series , never heard of one anyways<br>ususally they would use the NSX for honda teams<br><br>and pls do some research before posting an answer to a technical question, i'm quite surprised at how much you actually know about S2ks considering your user name  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>do you get your info from initial d acrade stage or soemting ? lol  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ones again u're rite kid. then again, there are also reasons why u still need the rpm, even if it does not give u extra punch (most useful in track sessions, i go to barbagello raceway sumtimes in perth). think of this (i know this sounds like id but hey id rip it off from the actual racing scenes anyway), if u are racing up a mountain, changing gear in the near the top of it will cause the car to lose sum of it's speed but if u have that extra rpm to work wif, u can climb all the way to the top, even if u have to change, the rev will ensure it's within the power band. also a s2k is notorious for it's peaky torque band and have to keep on it's vtec range to mantain power, having extra rev will ensure it does not fall below that band, it also give u more room to work with the clutch, brake and heal-toe technique (easier to recover from stuff up). i also know that with a few change in gear ratio all this problem can be resolve, but changing gear ratio will affect your acceleration and top end speed, which both is very crucial if u want to outrun your mates commodors (holden commodor, very popular v8 car here in australia, but heavy like truck).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if your gonna raise the revs on a stock car chances are you wont be gaining much extra power, and you'll risk stuffing up the valves<br>i'm still assuming your talking about stock s2ks, no cam work, no aftermarket piston etc etc so i dont see how raising the red line actually helps, all it does is kill the reliabilty<br>but when it comes to track i know of some mates of mine who increase the revs on their ITRs . no extra power after the original rev limit but the power doest drop either so yeah i recken it is still possible on an s2k , then again the F series engines are harder to mod than the b series<br>and racing v8 commorodes ford falcons and utes? your using the wrong car for the straight line drags man<br>s2k wasnt really designed to take on a v8 monsters on a straight. circuit , different story really but on a straight your better off using a good old turbo import<br>anyways just my 2 cents , with enough money anythings possible and so is a drag racing s2k<br><br></div>
