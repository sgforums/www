            <div class='col-md body'>I was looking at another post some time back on this Hyundai Coupe, trying to find some useful info on it, but it turns out to be a flaming session for many.<br><br>So anyway, I hope that I can get some honest and useful info now.<br><br>I'm planning to get one. Was down at Hyundai showroom to test drive it, and realised that it is a car that has nice exterior but sucks big time on the interior.<br>But, after owning a normal saloon car for years, I just feel like getting a car with nice exterior and don't care about the interior. So, God bless they build this cheapo car.<br><br>I'm not really looking for performance car, so I guess it's fine as long as it doesn't give me too much trouble.<br><br>Don't care if many says it's a poor-man's porche, cos.. who cares? As long as I'm happy, that's fine.<br><br>The only thing I found useful in this forum regarding this car, is that it has a rather lousy FC, of about 10km/L, although the sales agent told me it's only 9km/L.<br><br>The agent also told me that it has the same engine as the Hyundai Sonata.<br><br>My question here are:<br><br>1. Will these Hyundai engines give rise to any serious problem down the years, say 3-4 years?<br><br>My sister used to own this Hyundai Matrix, and she told me the engine has problem after the 3rd year already.<br><br>So what she said actually cast a bit of shadow on Hyundai's engine...<br><br>I used to have a mazda 323 and its engine is still perfect on the 3rd year.<br><br>And, since the coupe uses the same engine as the Sonata, I'm assuming here that anyone here who drives the Sonata can give me some comments on the engine/performance?<br>Whether it really creates a lot pf problems, etc?<br><br>2. Anyone here thinks it'll be a problem selling off the coupe eventually? Is so, why is that so? Any comments on this selling part is welcome.<br><br>3. Becasue of my profession, I'm getting a 0% downpayment for an OPC. The monthly works out to be $615/mth. Don't ask me why I want to get an OPC. I'm setting aside about $1000/mth for parking and petrol and misc. So i guess the petrol works out to be about $250/mth. My workplace is of ok-ok distance from my place. (when I was driving my mazda 323 of 11km/L, the petrol is about $200/mth.)<br><br>So what do you people think?<br><br>_______________________________________<br><br>Please, only sensible comments here. Thanks in advance!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally i think the a tus interior is quite nice,much better than some of my other friends rides interior eg.s15,rx7 trust me,with some other add ons it would look even better.FC wise i think it really depends on indivdual  drivers n the mods done to the cars,think its about 9-10km/l.Im not too sure about the sonata engine,but heard it was using a mitsu engine.Went to a few workshops with my tus driver friend,the mechanics said that the tus is using a european engine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have driven a korean car before and service my car with a mechanic who done alot of korean cars and his view is that korean cars have a higher chance of breaking down faster than other makes out there. THis is based on his intake of cars for servicing.  He says his record is receiving one KIA CARENS to change the gearbox just short of one year.<br><br>I am a firm believer of you get what you pay for.  While I think some korean cars look very nice and yet come cheaper than cars in their own category, I have to agree in terms of maintenance and performance, it may not be as good.<br><br>In buying cars, you cant buy a perfect car. Buy a car that suits your needs most.  Cars, whether Korean, Japanese or Euro fulfills different needs.  There is no arguement on whether this car is better or not because different cars meet different needs.<br><br>I change from a Korean Car to a Honda recently because I cannot stand the way it is drinking up petrol.  I pay at almost $200 more per month now but I save almost $200 per month on petrol too. Furthermore, in my first year of owning the KIA, I spend close to $1000 for maintenance and changing of parts believe it or not but with my Honda, everything still working fine.<br><br>Thus my belief is that work on your priorities in buying a car and see which car fits your needs most.  I always believe that there's a car for everyone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mmm .. saw Tuscani and initially tot is some European car ... later then found out it is Korean Car and it is a Hyundai car.<br><br>I would really applaud what Hyundai did and the recent models are outstanding in term of design even tot interior they still have a lot to catch up with European counterpart who is the trendsetter now.<br><br>Just a two cents worth of though ... many cite poor quality of engine and such for Hyundai .... during days of older elantra, sonata ... i guess the technology advancement for korean is still way or far behind that of Jap, European or American. But from what I see and observe, they had heavily invested R&amp;D and building design center in America and Europe. The most recent engine development I guess could develop in Europe and with European having the strict emission and safety standard .. I guess in no time Hyundai could catch up with their Jap counterpart and give a run for their $$$.<br><br>Many also forgotten that inital made in jap car (20 years ago) also had numerous quality problem and many a time you could see jap car breaks down. In past few years .. you could even check the top 5 car manufacturer defects/recalls. Dont be surprise that u can see Toyota being the top 5, plus Benz. I happened to read that column and surprise me that Hyundai is below some well-know car manufacturer who should have higher quality.<br><br>Another thing to note will be Toyota, the inital batch of Soluna ....problematic too. Isnt Jap brand car more reliable? Guess it boils down to where it manufacture and the standard of QA in the country. Generally, I found that Altis, the made in Thailand car, the build quality and the assembly quality is no longer as good as the one manufacture and assemble in Japan. See the wiring and u will know what I mean ...<br><br>Altis is Singapore no yet 3 years .. vvti if I am not too wrong also not in market for too long ....<br><br>Given time .. I believe Hyundai could be another car manufacturer that produce good quality cars ... check out the new Sonata - cool.<br><br>As for KIA ... u cant compare them to Hyundai. It is like you comparing Suzuki to Toyota. Financially, both are in two different world....</div>
