            <div class='col-md body'>AE86 is the chasis number along with the twincam engine set up. It have both the Levin and Trueno models.<br><br>AE85 is the Single Cam engine setup. It also has both the Trueno and Levin models. In the cartoon, this is regarded as a weaker car due to the weaker engine output and the lack of LSD.<br><br>It is a common misconception that the Levin is a lousier car and i hope this clears everything up.

I was hoping this car can refine my driving skills as i have read alot about it in overseas forums before deciding to get it. Pple are saying that if you can drive the AE86 well...then most prob u can handle any other type of car. I dunno how true it is but i would like to believe so as i personally find this car very very hard to drive.<br><br>But i guess another reason is that i have no money. But then again..that will not be a valid excuse cos even if i win New Year TOTO 10 million, i wouldnt change car also...may just buy a saloon to fetch my parents around...but the Hachi Roku will remain tightly bonded to my soul...haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Of couse they used racing cams and pistons and aftermarket ECUs for their setup.<br><br>maybe their unwillingness to change to a 20V engine block is evident that the 20V block is weaker?

I was hoping this car can refine my driving skills as i have read alot about it in overseas forums before deciding to get it. Pple are saying that if you can drive the AE86 well...then most prob u can handle any other type of car. I dunno how true it is but i would like to believe so as i personally find this car very very hard to drive.<br><br>But i guess another reason is that i have no money. But then again..that will not be a valid excuse cos even if i win New Year TOTO 10 million, i wouldnt change car also...may just buy a saloon to fetch my parents around...but the Hachi Roku will remain tightly bonded to my soul...haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>in fact if u win TOTO 10 million, it makes it all the more possible not only to keep your 86, but to restore every last bit in it to a very beautiful condition as well.</div>
