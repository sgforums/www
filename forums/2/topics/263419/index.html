The only thing I can contribute is that there is a definite reason why he does leave his best cars parked outside, and its [b]not</strong> because he wants to flaunt them to the world[/b]</blockquote>And how can YOU be so CERTAIN he didn't parked his exotic cars outside to show off? You are his very good friend ah? For gods sake, he has a underground carpark at basement 1..if he is really someone keen to be low key, he would have shifted all his cars into the basement carpark..not out in the sunshine and be every passerby's viewing pleasure..this is just my opinion.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I guess maybe to a certain extent he does like people to see them, seeing as he doesn't put on car covers, but that is not the reason why he parks them outside. Anyway thats enough on the topic from me</div>
