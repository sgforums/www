              <h1 class="clr">Fewer COEs for new quota year starting May 2008</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : There will be fewer Certificates of Entitlement for the new quota year starting from May 2008.</p>
              <p>The number will be cut 7.5 percent from the previous year to 115,946.</p>
              <p>Although
              the reduction is widely anticipated and in line with the effort to
              reduce congestion, the cut is still less than what car dealers had been
              bracing for.</p>
              <p>This and other issues related to the recent broad Land Transport Review came up for debate in Parliament on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Raymond
              Lim, Transport Minister, said: "I know, sadly, like what MP Cynthia
              Phua says, not everyone says my name with affection but that goes with
              the job."</p>
              <p>In a tongue—in—cheek start, the Transport Minister
              acknowledged how some recent announcements to keep traffic flowing on
              the streets have not always been popular.</p>
              <p>Jessica Tan, MP — East
              Coast GRC, said: "Higher costs will definitely result in improved road
              usage and traffic conditions. However, if public transport is not
              viable, it will only be a matter of time before congestion resurfaces.
              Hence the net impact will be increased costs."</p>
              <p>Cynthia Phua, MP —
              Aljunied GRC, said: "My only hope for the improvement of the public
              transport system now is the central planning of routes. My only request
              is that it can done faster and the planners must not be desktop
              planners. Go to the ground, take the buses and trains, understand the
              needs of the different segments of commuters, look at the whole
              journey."</p>
              <p>ERP was another hot potato with Opposition MP Low Thia
              Khiang wanting to know how the Ministry decides on where to set up the
              gantries.</p>
              <p>Lee Bee Wah, MP — Ang Mo Kio GRC, said: "As some of my
              residents call it: "Every round pay. You turn here you pay, you turn
              there you pay". Or in Malay, we say: "Pusing sini bayar, pusing sana
              bayar". Perhaps this is uniquely Singapore."</p>
              <p>On competition, Mr Lim said it was not just a numbers game.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said: "The key is to ensure markets are contestable and that people can come in and bid for packages."</p>
              <p>Turning
              to fares, Mr Lim said the Public Transport Council is reviewing the
              fare formula, as it is supposed to do after three years.</p>
              <p>However,
              he rejected calls by some MPs for more concessions to be given to the
              elderly, saying there were richer senior citizens too.</p>
              <p>Instead he said more targeted help for those who really needed it was a better option.</p>
              <p>On
              ERP and the worsening problem of congestion, especially after cars
              became cheaper in recent years, Mr Lim’s response was: "Even if we were
              to cut vehicle population growth rate to 0, you will still need the
              recent ERP changes to deal with existing congestion from the 850,000
              vehicles."</p>
              <p>As for whether there is any optimal car growth rate,
              Mr Lim said, after this, the rate has been fixed to a 1.5 percent
              annual increase.</p>
              <p>But this figure is not locked in — it will be reviewed after three years.</p>
              <p>As for transparency, Mr Lim said ERP charges will be mounted prominently on top of all gantries by year—end.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Lim said: "So when you see that — don’t brake suddenly, just take note
              of it so that the next time you know that in the next half hour, how
              much it’ll cost you. Please make a considered decision."</p>
              <p>In the
              end, taking a holistic view, Mr Lim said the idea was to ensure that as
              the population grows Singapore remains a city in a garden and not city
              in a carpark. — CNA/ch</p>
