All other aspects quite ordinary.<br><br>Altis - Cheap, big and comfy with good FC and big boot.

At least for the one I drove  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  But it is a practical family sedan for city driving, as can be testified by the number of Altis roaming along the roads of SG.<br><br>It may not be that advisable to get the Sunny as I think that it is going to be obselete soon.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the FC may not be a deciding factor<br><br>1) Sunny -&gt; you can get 100% loan. No need pay any downpayment<br>Price is cheapest compared to Altis and Lancer<br><br>2) Altis -&gt; best car of the 3. But monthly instalment cost you extra about $80/mth compared to Sunny.<br><br>3) Lancer -&gt; price is middle, but you have to pay abt 10% instalment if i am not wrong. If its really 10%, you are paying upfront $5k+ compared to Nissan, zero downpayment. So meaning that you are paying $5k+ upfront for your FC already.<br><br>i personally feel that Lancer and Sunny is more cost saving car<br><br>Altis is the best among all,but slightly expensive. If you can afford, go for Altis. If you want the best value for $ car, think Sunny is good.<br><br>* thats the comparison i have made also, between these 3 cars ^^<br><br>i chose Sunny<br><br></div>

Also can get loan rebate for $2000, provided you loan more than....i can't remember...<br>At the end, it cost 52488 + 300=52788. Minus the later 2000 rebate from loan, final cost around 50788...<br>Do your think i can ask more freebies from the SE?<br><br></div>

I am still thinking what to choose....<br>maybe Lancer, bcos the price is not too ex...<br>Even think of Civic, but the $ is a bit too high for me. I am looking for something below 60K...Jap cars...<br><br>By the way, what's the comment for Latio sport model (except the $, which is a bit ex, 65K)? </div></blockquote>City? Better FC than Altis, biggest boot I even see, spacious, plus its auto technology is among the best. Price about 60k too.<br><br>Sunny, you will cry when you need to keep topping up.<br>Lancer, manual is great, auto ...... can only drive softly, FC about ave of 12kph or less for auto.<br>Altis, Best deal so far from your list for an auto car. Not because it is good, ut because others isn't.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Long long ago, nissan is very fuel economical. But since ard 6 years ago, itz drinking petrol. had a sunny vip back then, fc is ridiculously high.<br><br>altis from what i heard from my fren, quite economical. power wise better than the other two imo. coz i have a hard time keeping up with my altis fren on the road. Am driving a lancer auto.<br><br>For lancer, i find itz ok but another fren who considered it ended getting colt plus.said lancer no power. perhaps coz i dont drive hard so no diff. sat in colt plus. feels significant "power" than lancer. maybe coz mivec engine.<br><br>Both lancer and sunny, interior very old. from last models. over facelift outside.<br><br></div>
