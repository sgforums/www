Although the Malaysian police will tell you the fine is RM300, that is the max. Usually, the fine is only around RM70-100 (depending on how fast you were going).<br><br>Half the time, when you say you will take the summons, the cops will just drop the matter.

            <div class='col-md body'>most insurane do cover up for leisure car drive to malaysia(12 or slightly more per year),as long as you do not drive to malaysia dailys  every month. That you have to tell your insurance company to review your preium plan. It will be higher. It is to safe guard your car and accident preium on your passenger too. If not any accident ,there they will void your indurance claim.<br>Therefore, check with your insurance company,if you travelled more.<br><br>week-end car, you can drive there weekday too. if you can reach over to JB -immigrant before 7a.m. you can spend the whole day there driving,without the coupon and come back to singapore -immigrant after 7pm. You are safe.<br>i have try that  a few years back when the weekend car scheme started during 1991.</div>
