            <div class='col-md body'>woohoo!! i've finally received my axio after a long wait!<br><br>i have quite the same opinion as won after clocking 80km tonite. i'll like to add that i quite like the feature where the car will kaopei if one of ur passengers nv put on seat belt.<br><br>i'm still running in my car so i nv really tested the acceleration. it feels quite powerful though, even though i'm trying hard not to step on the accelerator too hard. not really very powerful la, but slightly more powerful than a lancer (at least my sis's one). of cuz, that's only on the low-rev side. i'll test it fully with the 'S' mode after i finish my run-in. haven tested the handling yet.<br><br>contrary to popular belief, the Super-CVTi is actually quite responsive. sound wise, quite okay la. can't say it's completely quiet (it IS, when stopping at traffic lights) but neither is it noisy.<br><br>i got used to the lack of the tachometer quickly but not really used to the small rear legroom yet.<br><br>on the way home after my spin, there was some sort of construction going on, and i kenna ALOT of stones flying about on my rear. u noe, the kind of 'tart tart tart' sound going on behind. after i parked my car and check, got a very small stone chip near the tail. abit sim tia.. anyone knows how to avoid this kind of stone chips?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Comment about axio, to be frank when PI gave you warranty normally it will not come through from what I had experience a few times for my past ride.<br>I had already mod most of the things in my ride. Before mod, I had tried with mazda 3, I think the drive can only see my tail light from far. Overall very comfortable and for toyota, resale value is always the highest. Its really worth buying as compare to Hyundai, Lancer, Mazda. Fuel consumption is damn low.<br>For axio 1.5A it come with high spec which is the one with 2 different gear mode and for 1.8A comes with the spec like 1.5A high spec just with a bigger CC</div>
