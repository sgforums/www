CVT can be considered an auto 'box, but it ain't FOUND IN an auto gearbox..an Automatic Transmission and a CVT is TOTALLY different.. </div></blockquote>was it stated anywhere in ur post that the difference u were pointing out was that one used a torque convertor whilst the other didn't? learn to express urself clearly before attempting to post.<br><br>anyway, wads ur point in harping on the difference between a "normal" auto tranny and a CVT tranny, which is also an auto tranny, when the crux of the matter was that ExSpirit misrepresented the fact that the evo x comes with CVT where in fact it did not? do not argue for the sake of arguing unless u have a point to prove. too much free time? pick up a hobby.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alleggerita:</div><div class="quote_body"> And point number two..the thing that determines whether a car is 4WD or 2WD is the TRANSMISSION..Whether or not the car is 4WD or 2WD is NOT determined by the engine.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If you dunno what's TRANSMISSION, Google is your best friend.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>i said an engine meant for a 2WD drivetrain cannot be mated to a 4WD drivetrain, although the reverse is possible. does my statement looked like i was asking you the question whether a car's drivetrain configuration is determined by the engine or the transmission? again, do not argue for the sake of arguing (read; pick up a hobby).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alleggerita:</div><div class="quote_body">But if you are too lazy to consult Google, then I shall tell you what I mean..4WD or not is determined by the transmission and NOT the engine..take the Subaru R1/R2 for example..it comes standard WITHOUT Subaru's famed Symmetrical 4WD system..but IF the customer wants, he/she CAN specify to fit their R1/R2 with Subaru's Symmetrical 4WD system..<br><br>So is the engine in the R1/R2 changed just because it needs to accommodate the 4WD system? No right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>if subaru had engineers who thought like u, they'd be making safety pins instead of cars.<br><br>anyone who had a slight inclination for the mechanics between engine and drivetrain would tell you that it would be much more complicated to design a 4WD drivetrain than a 2WD drivetrain for any particular engine. u think subaru engineers developed the R series with a 2WD drivetrain in mind only to crack their arses open thinking how to slap a 4WD drivetrain onto the engine as an "option"? u cook rice is wash away the sand first then cook or cook liao then think of how to wash away the sand stuck in the rice?<br><br>finally, u still fail to convince anyone that ur argument holds water. but we digress. this thread is for ppl to come an share their views on the evo x, not for ignorant debate on whether what i corrected ExSpirit on the evo x is 100%, 50% or whatever percent correct. i welcome intelligent argument on other matters but certainly not on these grounds.</div>
