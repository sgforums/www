            <div class='col-md body'>Based on how the TS wrote I understand how this driver feel when he was being horned. I believed that the traffic along Hougang Ave 2/3 can be very heavy at times and hence very difficult to filter out especially when it it at the rightmost lane and the car wants to go straight.<br><br>I feel that the lorry driver is the main one at fault as he thinks that he is one big shot and just horning away as he likes. The lorry driver should just be patient and just wait behind. The cars on the left in fact should also slow down and give way to such cars in this situation if possible.</div>
