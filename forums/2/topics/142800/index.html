            <div class='col-md body'>The RX7 is not an easy car to drive plus there is no more omv since it's a coe car. Hence, it will depreciate at more than 10k per annum. It is also a very old outdated car. A few years later, it will be worthless. It burns petrol at 5km/litre. I suggest u buy Celica. Depreciate at 6k per annum, comsumption at 13-15km/litre. The interior and age will be far newer. When people get in your car, they will also feel much more comfortable. The RX7 suspension is extremely stiff and rough.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unless this is going to be your second car, I strongly suggest you do not buy the RX7. Given the massive horsepower and rear wheel drive, this car is very prone to skidding on wet roads. This car has taken many drivers by surprise and crashed spectacularly. The front wheel drive Celica with a more reasonable horsepower is far more forgiving. Did I mention the ultra uncomfortable ride in the RX7? Your bones will vibrate with every bump on the road. The Celica has a far more compliant suspension. Gals will love the ride in the Celica. Your future is bright, don't risk your life with this kind of car. Buy the Celica.</div>

Drink fuel like plain water. If u are a practical person meaning u just WANT a car for ur own convenience rather den to attract babes, den its true kelisa or picanto is more den enuff for one. Or else get a honda jazz or mazda 3 or vios... i think these cars suits all kind of ages depending on the colour loh.<br><br>Use car attract babes no use one lah ... unless u are those who just go for flings. Materialistic gals dun last. Attract a gal by ur personality not by the wheels.<br><br>Hrmm i am totally envious sia.. can afford car... surely parents support one loh. Rich boi Me completed ns liao also going uni soon. Ever though of picanto weekend but i think its too heavy for me and my family.<br><br>Eh where u stay ah.. which uni? hee hee hitch a ride leh.</div></blockquote>how about the suzuki ignis sport? 60k brand new. 1.5litre. about 100hp. superb fwd handling. fun! or the new swift also good. same engine. check it out lah at champion motor......</div>
