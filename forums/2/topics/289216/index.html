            <div class='col-md body'>Quote from wikipedia<br><br>On high-traction surfaces such as bitumen, or concrete many (though not all) ABS-equipped cars are able to <strong>attain braking distances better (i.e. shorter) </strong>than those that would be easily possible without the benefit of ABS. Even an alert, skilled driver without ABS would find it difficult, even through the use of techniques like threshold braking, to match or improve on the performance of a typical driver with an ABS-equipped vehicle, in realworld conditions. ABS reduces chances of crashing, and/or the severity of impact. The recommended technique for non-expert drivers in an ABS-equipped car, in a typical full-braking emergency, is to press the brake pedal as firmly as possible and, where appropriate, to steer around obstructions. In such situations, ABS will significantly reduce the chances of a skid and subsequent loss of control.<br><br></div>
