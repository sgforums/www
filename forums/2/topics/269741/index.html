You get a more spacious car for about the same price. And since looks dun matter much to you the city would serve you well I think. It has the ultra seats to help you produce miracles (of life) too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Final decision is still yours to make tho.<br><br>Anyway I do not have a personal PI to recommend, but I'm trying to get a contact from the Honda AD. Will get back to you prolly by tmr evening.<br><br>Click <a href="http://www.shc-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=1359" rel="nofollow">Here!!</a> to have an idea of the the difference between the 2 cars. Best is to go walk around and find out the current specs of the car you will be getting as that thread is pretty old. Also, note that the Jazz/Fit is a 4-5 yr model and is due for replacement, as far as I know, in a year, latest. Go surf around, you might even find some renderings of the new Jazz out there.<br><br></div>

I was thinking of a car which cost around &lt;$65k.<br><br>Anyway, here's a little background on my budget...I would be putting a downpayment of around $10k and my max installment ceiling would be $750/month and from my calculations I would break-even in 4.5years if I take a loan period 7 years @ 2.85%.<br><br>So, could anyone recommend me which car I should consider buying? I'm pretty much clueless here so could anyone kindly recommend?<br><br>Many many thanks!!!</div></blockquote>send u a pm already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
