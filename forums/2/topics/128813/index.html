The braking performance of the W211 E-Class is actually top notch, namely considering its a brake-by-wire system (known as the SBC in Mercedes terms) and I would say that the braking is far from "having problems" stopping a vehicle weighing 1560kg (less in the case of the E200K).<br><br>Just for comparision a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 8 weighs 1480kg, and considering just the amount of finishing and features that goes into producing an E, it is not "damn heavy" either.
