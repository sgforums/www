              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I got into an accident late last year and recently got a summon to court for hearing. Apparently, TP found a witness for the accident. Details of accident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Happened at T junction</p>
              <p>2) My car and a van collided</p>
              <p>3) No injury to the other driver and slight damage to the side of the van</p>
              <p>4) My car badly damaged as it hit the pavement and the lamp post</p>
              <p>5) I suffered minor injuries and was transported to hospital. Discharged in 2 hrs</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to TP, there was a witness who saw that I crossed the red light. I was not speeding but I could have mistakenly saw the green light at a traffic light ahead of the traffic light I was at and crossed the red light. The charge is dangerous driving.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Advice needed:</p>
              <p>- What will be the most likely penalty for me?</p>
              <p>- I am considered a new driver. The date of accident was 2 weeks after my 1st year of getting my licence and less than 1 year after I bought my car. Does this play a part in judging?</p>
              <p>- I have never committed any offence before the accident for speeding or crossing red light. Does this help?</p>
              <p>- Are there any tips for me to plead for leniency?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am still quite traumatized with this accident even though no one was injured except myself.....Seriously thinking of giving up on driving.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi BrUtUs,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, I was going straight and the van was turning right.....</p>
              <p>IO told me usually lighter sentence if I plead guilty.... They say they have a witness and normally their statement is pretty strong....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am in a dilemma....</p>

              <p>The only advice i have is to plead guilty. My dad had to go to court over a traffic offence, and he had to wait his turn in line with other various traffic offenders to see the judge, and he says that anyone who tries to plead innocence and appeals only gets a harsher sentence and doesn't get away with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry to say but I've heard that from others too, and from your account of the situation I don't think you can get away from the charges here if you did indeed go through red light, even if only by accident.</p>

              <p>Thanks Elysium.</p>
              <p>I think so too.... Anyway like you said, if there is a witness who saw me cross the red light, then maybe I really did though it was not intentional.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will probably plead guilty and ask for leniency.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Got to drive carefully everyone! For your sake as well as other road users</p>

              <p>I remembered seeing a green light...but the road was very  long and there was about 2  overhead lights ahead of me....TP said I may have mistaken the green light to be the next traffic light ahead rather than the traffic light I was at... Sometimes happen when the road is long and there are more than one overhead traffic light... Too many colours and it was at night too...</p>
              <p>Think bad luck... but luckily no one was injured... else I will be feel so bad....</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I just attended court for my case today. Got 2.5K fine as 6 months suspension.....</p>
              <p>Teaches me a good lesson to be careful on the roads.Maybe I will give up driving as I cannot risk getting into another accident and go to jail next time. My future will be ruined!</p>
              <p>Drivers out there... if you need to drive, do be very careful!</p>
