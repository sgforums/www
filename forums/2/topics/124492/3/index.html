It is one of the first production 5-valve engines in history.<br>Vtec is valve timing technology but it is still 4 valve per cylinder.<br><br></div></blockquote>fyi, the B16A4 doesn't come port and polished. honda only hand ported the B16B type-R heads which is why they command a premium over the B16A4 which were mass produced like the 20 valve 4A-GE's. if honda hand ported every B16A head they made over the years, they would have to employed 100 times more employees in their factory to do that. ever used ur brains before ur use the term "All Sir and type R engine are ported and polish and heavily modified....

            <div class='col-md body'>actually recent performance by both teams is not due to driver or money. both teams are very well funded. instead, i would attribute it to a few things, including honda losing Richard Davids as team principal end of last year, mike gascoyne's designs coming onto bloom, and the technical directions taken by both teams. honda's engines are generally a bit fragiler, while toyota's engines have always been quite powerful and not known to suffer from technical failures.</div>
