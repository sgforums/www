It's only *20* horses more, but those 20 horses were really tweaked out using Honda's formula 1 knowledge -- from an engine that was already getting 100 horsepower per liter. Fumiyasu Suga, Type R's assistant chief engineer, was kind enough to sit down with us.<br><br>Currently, <strong>production line engines and engine parts are made by computer</strong>-guided NCR machines, and are of very high quality. However, Mr. Suga believes that in order to make a <strong>true race engine</strong>, some parts must be <strong>built/assembled by hand</strong>. In specific, the assembling of the engine, balancing parts, and porting and polishing need to be done by hand. Amazingly, all Type R engines are built this way.  </blockquote>etc etc<br></div>
