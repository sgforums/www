              <p>I was unhappy to be given a $30 fine for not displaying a parking coupon when i've done so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope all bro and sis can help think of solutions towards these questions.</p>
              <p>History : I bought my car in 2008 but that is the 3rd car in the family so HDB don't wanna give me a parking space under my block, i find its reasonable so i decide to buy a parking lot 10 minutes walk from my house near the market. 4 months ago i managed to find a big parking place 2 blocks away from my house, i've notice that there is almost 15 to 20 empty space at night so i decide to ask HDB to give me a space there but was rejected saying there is no free lots.</p>
              <p>I decided to park there using over night coupon loh since they don't wanna give me a lot. So $2 x 30 days = $60/ months is stll ok i think. But recently i was given a fine of $30 for not displaying an over night parking coupon which i've did.</p>
              <p>Problem:</p>
              <p>1. I recieved a fine of $30 for not displaying an over night parking coupon which i've did. I did appeal online but was rejected. I know it'll be rejected cos there is no prove that i've displace an parking coupon. But i think that is unfair to me and many others if the parking aunty issue a fine wrongly, there is no ground for us to fight unless they take photo of the dash board to prove that they are giving fine correctly. I dunno do they have such practise or not lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Wonder why HDB don't wanna give me a lot despite of so many free lots.</p>
              <p>3. The over night parking is now $2 but it'll increase to $4 in nov, i dont think i can pay $120 per month. LTA and HDB are saying the increase of $4 is to stop people from parking over night but how about people like me? I'm sure im not the only person that live near my place facing such problem. I think $4 will not stop people from parking over night loh. Please lah.. i any one of us wanna stay over friend's place for world cup, etc all don't mind to pay $4 to park over loh..i dunno wth they are think lah.</p>
              <p>I know many will think WTF 3 cars in family still wanna KPKB ya..we've though of selling away my car.... my dad has a commercial van that he needs for his hawker biz. both my bro and me has a car each and we both work in different places. Im working in jurong island and he is working in woodlands and he is working sales so he needs to move about with his car.</p>
              <p>So bro and sis please help in giving me some useful advice. I posted in stomp before and was slapped by many funny people not giving useful advice. I hope i can really find some help from here. :)</p>

              <p>Dear storywolf,</p>
              <p>i dunno have u read my post in detail? I'm ok to pay for the fine if i really din tear a valid parking coupon. But i did. The reason for this post is for all to discuss, bring awareness on such thing actually happens. And what can we do? Im sure many people encounter such problem as well and HBD many just pay the $30 fine and let HDB/private parking companies earn money. I think they need to come out with something to prove that we drivers are in wrong before they give us a fine. If they can show me a photo on my dash box to prove that i din not tear the parking coupon then lan lan i pay..if HDB dun believe our words then how can trust that those parking aunties ?</p>
              <p>BTW thanks all bro and sister for your genuine comments...Rock^star bro, ya these private parking companies all farkers.</p>
