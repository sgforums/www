            <div class='col-md body'>Hi! me from SSDC too just passed today, posted this on another forum, share with you guys here, my experience.<br>Just passed TP this afternoon SSDC 1.55pm session route 1,  1st attempt.<br>Out of my group of 8 persons 5 passed.<br>So it is not true Mondays are difficult to pass.<br>I greet the tester, but he very sterned, initially I did answer like 'yes sir' or 'ok sir' but later coz too many times liow sianz and also need to concentrate on driving, he didnt seem to mind.<br>Circuit, everything sui-sui, till my parallel ( usually my vertical is worse ), I parked too close to the kerb, he was not pleased at all, and pointed to the kerb and hissed something. I a bit gan jiong liow, looked sorry and said sorry sir! He asked me to drive out, I did something I shouldnt do while I reverse, turned my steering to the left one round when I am already so close to the kerb, oppps! bumped the kerb though lightly, tester even more stern like want to scold me liow. Full lock to the right but left front cannot clear kerb so I reverse again oppps! bumped again  , I think si liow and tester face also become black and I became more gan jiong but what to do whats done is done and he gestured me to drive out of the lot. MY mind oredi calculating the points<br>Anyway, tester asked me do the directional change again though I did oredi, maybe test me or giv me chance I dont know, but I did no mistake, phew.<br>Out to the road, I calmed down coz I always feel more confident on the road rather than in circuit. Everything smooth but traffic quite heavy surprisingly, and they dont give way to testee cars at all unlike in the circuit kinda feel like VIP, here they bully you so watch out.<br>Returning to SSDC, another testee car in front of me, phew ending soon liow, then suddenly one cab all sudden jam brake pick up passenger, the test car in front jam also, lucky me a bit further behind so braked smoother. So guys just watched out for the dreaded taxis.<br>In the end, passed 12 points, circuit hit kerb during parking twice 4*2=8, otr 4 points for abrupt lane change, coz when U-turn changing lane to right, traffic quite heavy, waiting for the last car to pass me then I can move right, but I think he either afraid I sudden swerve in or he wanted me to cut in I dont know, we maintained that position for a while until I decided I to near junction liow so just acccelerate and cut in lor if not have to go straight liow, even worse.<br>I never had to do E-brake, coz I guessed that time circuit a lot of cars, I did the whole route, no change by tester. Did DR twice. Instructor looked stern and never smiling type, we also never chat at all. Guess, on the road I drived quite smoothly and confidently, otherwise if he wants to fail me he can ticked things like never checked blindspot, or insufficient acceleration, which is hard to argue against. So give the tester a smooth, safe ride so he knows you can drive in the real world too.<br>It is kind of long  hope you guys dont mind, coz everything is still fresh in my mind.</div>
