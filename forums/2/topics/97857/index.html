            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tips for reducing fuel consumption</strong><br><br>The way you drive and the condition of your car has an impact on the amount of petrol you use. Here are a few tips to help you save petrol and money.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">10 TOP TIPS FOR FUEL EFFICIENT DRIVING</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Minimise your vehicle use</span><br>Plan to do a number of errands in one trip rather than several trips and save both time and fuel. Try to avoid short vehicle trips by walking or cycling, this will save over a quarter of a kilogram of greenhouse gas emissions per kilometre of vehicle driving it replaces. Also avoid peak-hour traffic whenever possible.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Drive in high gear</span><br>The engine runs most efficiently between around 1,500 and 2,500 rpm (lower in diesels). To maintain these low revs you should change up through the gears as soon as practical and before the revs reach 2500 rpm.<br><br>Automatic transmissions will shift up more quickly and smoothly if you ease back slightly on the accelerator once the car gathers momentum.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Drive smoothly - avoid unnecessary acceleration</span><br>Drive at a good distance from the car in front so you can anticipate and travel with the flow of traffic. This avoids unnecessary acceleration and frequent repetitive braking that ends up wasting fuel. It's also far safer.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Minimise fuel wasted in idling</span><br>Minimise fuel wasted in idling by stopping the engine whenever your car is stopped or held up for an extended period of time. By having the engine switched off, even for a short period, you will save more fuel than is lost from the burst of fuel involved in restarting the engine. The net increased wear and tear from this practice is negligible.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Speed kills economy</span><br>High speeds result in high fuel consumption. At 110 km/h your car uses up to 25 per cent more fuel than it would cruising at 90 km/h.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. Minimise aerodynamic drag</span><br>Additional parts on the exterior of a vehicle such as roof racks and spoilers, or having the window open, increases air resistance and fuel consumption, in some cases by over 20%.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7. Look after your vehicle's tyres</span><br>Inflate your vehicle's tyres to the highest pressure recommended by the manufacture and make sure your wheels are properly aligned. Looking after your tyres will not only reduce your fuel consumption it will also extend tyre life and improve handling.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8. Use air conditioning sparingly</span><br>Air conditioners can use about 10 per cent extra fuel when operating. However, at speeds of over 80 km/h, use of air conditioning is better for fuel consumption than an open window.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">9. Travel light</span><br>The more a vehicle carries, the more fuel it uses; an extra 50 kg of weight can increase your fuel bill by 2 per cent.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10. Service your vehicle regularly</span><br>Keep your vehicle well tuned and reduce greenhouse gases by up to 5 per cent.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Here are a few tips to help you save petrol and money.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">10 TOP TIPS FOR FUEL EFFICIENT DRIVING</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Minimise your vehicle use</span><br>Plan to do a number of errands in one trip rather than several trips and save both time and fuel. Try to avoid short vehicle trips by walking or cycling, this will save over a quarter of a kilogram of greenhouse gas emissions per kilometre of vehicle driving it replaces. Also avoid peak-hour traffic whenever possible.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Drive in high gear</span><br>The engine runs most efficiently between around 1,500 and 2,500 rpm (lower in diesels). To maintain these low revs you should change up through the gears as soon as practical and before the revs reach 2500 rpm.<br><br>Automatic transmissions will shift up more quickly and smoothly if you ease back slightly on the accelerator once the car gathers momentum.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Drive smoothly - avoid unnecessary acceleration</span><br>Drive at a good distance from the car in front so you can anticipate and travel with the flow of traffic. This avoids unnecessary acceleration and frequent repetitive braking that ends up wasting fuel. It's also far safer.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Minimise fuel wasted in idling</span><br>Minimise fuel wasted in idling by stopping the engine whenever your car is stopped or held up for an extended period of time. By having the engine switched off, even for a short period, you will save more fuel than is lost from the burst of fuel involved in restarting the engine. The net increased wear and tear from this practice is negligible.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. Speed kills economy</span><br>High speeds result in high fuel consumption. At 110 km/h your car uses up to 25 per cent more fuel than it would cruising at 90 km/h.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">6. Minimise aerodynamic drag</span><br>Additional parts on the exterior of a vehicle such as roof racks and spoilers, or having the window open, increases air resistance and fuel consumption, in some cases by over 20%.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">7. Look after your vehicle's tyres</span><br>Inflate your vehicle's tyres to the highest pressure recommended by the manufacture and make sure your wheels are properly aligned. Looking after your tyres will not only reduce your fuel consumption it will also extend tyre life and improve handling.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">8. Use air conditioning sparingly</span><br>Air conditioners can use about 10 per cent extra fuel when operating. However, at speeds of over 80 km/h, use of air conditioning is better for fuel consumption than an open window.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">9. Travel light</span><br>The more a vehicle carries, the more fuel it uses; an extra 50 kg of weight can increase your fuel bill by 2 per cent.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10. Service your vehicle regularly</span><br>Keep your vehicle well tuned and reduce greenhouse gases by up to 5 per cent.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">[/b]</blockquote>Thanks for your tipsQ These sounds pretty logical and sound   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Are we talking about moving vehicles or stationary vehicles?<br><br>If stationary, the reason why the tachometer is lower when in D is because of the resistance the engine meets when you apply your brake.<br>The gear is sort of half engaged because it has to start moving once you release the brake.<br><br>Applying brakes also require electricity which means more fuel is needed.<br><br>If moving, i have read about the no fuel thing as well...</div>

The change of auto gear box cost about $6000, translate into 48,000 km based on 12km/l consumption. Boh hua right....But, at traffic light, if don't shift to "N", u put yrself in danger b'cos if someone hit u from behind, yr car will move into the crossing traffic....sure liao one. So, depends on situation and how long u waited.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
