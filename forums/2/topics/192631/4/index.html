I didn't ever have any doubt as to which market this discussion is based. If all of u have been talking about sg market all along, then your points are moot because the car which gave rise to the discussion is the UK-spec civic, which is not currently available in sg.

In 03, Seat hadn't even entered the sport yet, which is why honda managed 2nd in the constuctor's and team standing. even so, they were over 200 points off Vauxhall and team honda was over 100 points off VX Racing. Then come 04 when Seat stepped into the fray. Honda might have come 2nd in the manufacturer's standings, but teamwise, Seat Sports came 2nd, WSR (the MGs) came 3rd. Halfords (CTRs) 4th and Team Honda 5th.<br><br>The new ITRs? actually some of the old ones from last year have won races this year. The privateers are smart to get their hands on the old Team Dynamics cars. What I'm thinking tho, is the field seems a bit more evenly matched this year. The Seats and the *surprise* MGs have been up there challenging for the win. If Matt Neal doesn't start from the 1st 2 rows, chances are he won't win the race.<br><br>To be honest, I do think the primary reason why the ITR is doing so well now is largely attributable to the fact that Matt Neal is driving. That man is a minor legend in BTCC. The other ITRs seldom do as consistantly well, and u often see Matt Neal n his ITR winning, then 2nd to 4th are the Seats and then followed by the MGs.<br><br>Personally, using the BTCC as an example of the civic being class leading, is not going to work I must say. I look at it, and there are 4 other models which are more likely to win before the CTR is even given a shot.</div>
