The 3 cars are all pretty evenly matched.<br><br>RX8, WRX STi, EVO, can definately be compared with M3s and the like. The comparism is often made in car mags here, esp for the EVO n WRX, whose 4wd more than offsets the bhp deficit. Of course, as we all know, the EVO and WRX are often officially under-declared on bhp, so the deficit isn't even that small. The comparism is definately more than fair.<br><br>The fact is, Japs cars ARE comparable against contis, and more than fair to do so. The point here is that, they are NOT the current field leaders, because Europeans have made a bigger leap in the last 5 years. Next 5 years, who knows who will lead again? May be the japs again, may be the Europeans still, or gawd forbid, even the Americans *shock!!!* or Koreans! *horror!!!!*<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tiggersgd:</div><div class="quote_body">2. if its harsh truth, then so be it. jap car owners know that they are only getting jap quality cars. it can never be compared with a conti. try disputing that with any jap or conti owners and most likely you get an answer of "what is there to compare?" etc.<br><br>as to leading the field, i believe u will have to clear it with n0x. only he/she can reply to you on what leading the field means.<br><br>then again, civic 8th gen is already a notch up from its predecessor, if not notches up. go read from both ends of the world's car reviews and you'll find out...gd n bad of this car.</div></blockquote>u know i only said that they don't lead the field. That doesn't mean they're not quality cars. there is a distinct difference in the 2, which is a distinction i think u will have to to make, because i get the impression u think im slamming jap cars. I'm making a frank observation that the japs currently do not lead the field, although they are pretty much capable of challenging the leaders. That does not imply that their products are inferior in quality in any way. Personally I think there is a lot to compare, as it is very interesting technologically how different people with different design cultures come up with solutions that are very similiar in nature. Of course the diffusion of design talent internationally means that this sort of distinction is now less noticable. But with the existance of an overall company culture, there will still be some colouring in design philosophies.<br><br>Of course, this could be just me, because as an engineer-to-be, I do find that such comparisms are very interesting, and very telling. It even helps to forecast future automotive trends, so it definately bears watching for me.<br><br>My final stand is, I'm not saying the 8th Gen civic is a bad car. I'm just pointing out that its not a leader in its field.</div>

I'm going to point out to u that the Golf is in the same market segment as the Ford Focus, and is, in fact, the main rival of the Focus. Image-wise, its every bit a family car as well.

In fact VW has marketed the Golf every bit as such. I'm wondering if its because there is a GTi varient that makes u unable to see it as a family car, which is strange because the similarly hardcore and powered Focus ST should do that to the Focus as well, and what about the insane Astra VXR? yet u think of it as a family car...<br><br>i mean u keep talking about image and how they market the car, the golf is a family car through and through and has always been marketed as such.</div>

I didn't ever have any doubt as to which market this discussion is based. If all of u have been talking about sg market all along, then your points are moot because the car which gave rise to the discussion is the UK-spec civic, which is not currently available in sg. I am sure I have my facts right. Um, the question is, do u?
