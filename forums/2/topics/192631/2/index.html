            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by weiqimun:</div><div class="quote_body">for jap brands, only honda's won the f1 constructor title before. toyota is trying now but going nowhere despite having one of the biggest budget in f1.<br><br>i think civic raise the bar all round for a mid-size jap saloon. make the rest like altis, mazda 3, seplhy and the jap lot looked so yesterday lah....</div></blockquote>thats a bit silly, because as far as we know, ONLY TWO jap manufacturers have properly contested F1 before. And Honda did NOT win the constructor's title. They were merely engine suppliers. Williams and McLaren were the ones who won the constructor's title. Currently, Honda is going nowhere as a full F1 constructor itself as well.<br><br>Anyways, to have to refer to past glories, I can name a lot of past glories for other jap amnufacturers. For one, Honda has never won or done well in international GT racing, while Nissan, Mazda, and to a certain extent, Toyota, have. Toyota, Subaru, Mitsubishi have all had rallying success as well. Mazda's 787B won le Mans outright.<br><br>In the introduction of innovative-technology-wise, honda only has the Vtec and i-Vtec to offer. Other jap manufacturers have offered a whole host of innovative technologies such as Nissan's ATTESA, ATTESA-ETS, ATTESA-ETS Pro, HICAS. It's RB26DETT engine is as legendary as Honda's B16B and B18C-series engines. And to that mix we can throw in Mazda's 13B-REW and Toyota's 2JZ-GTE engines.<br><br>In conclusion, Honda is no doubt a major manufacturer, and perhaps the only jap manufacturer to have ever had some degree of F1 success. But to say the civic raises the bar all-round for mid-size jap saloons and coupes, I disagree.</div>

The fact is, u CAN compare them spec-wise.<br><br>Im saying the civic doesn't lead the field, based on its specs alone, independent of where they are. I have not at any time, pointed to the civic in sg alone and made that claim. in fact, looking at n0x's statement, and putting the entire exchange in perspective, i believe he was making the "leader of the field" comment about the UK civic, which means its more than justified to say it is not a field leader compared to other cars within its field. So certainly, its not biased in anyway. Esp if u look at my previous post in response to tiggersgd, I even said that Jap cars were leaders of many fields during the mid 90s. The fact is, u currently have to give credit to the contis for having taken a huge step in design, and coming out ahead of the japs at the moment.</div>
