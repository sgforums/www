In 03, Seat hadn't even entered the sport yet, which is why honda managed 2nd in the constuctor's and team standing. even so, they were over 200 points off Vauxhall and team honda was over 100 points off VX Racing. Then come 04 when Seat stepped into the fray. Honda might have come 2nd in the manufacturer's standings, but teamwise, Seat Sports came 2nd, WSR (the MGs) came 3rd. Halfords (CTRs) 4th and Team Honda 5th.<br><br>The new ITRs? actually some of the old ones from last year have won races this year. The privateers are smart to get their hands on the old Team Dynamics cars. What I'm thinking tho, is the field seems a bit more evenly matched this year. The Seats and the *surprise* MGs have been up there challenging for the win. If Matt Neal doesn't start from the 1st 2 rows, chances are he won't win the race.<br><br>To be honest, I do think the primary reason why the ITR is doing so well now is largely attributable to the fact that Matt Neal is driving. That man is a minor legend in BTCC. The other ITRs seldom do as consistantly well, and u often see Matt Neal n his ITR winning, then 2nd to 4th are the Seats and then followed by the MGs.<br><br>Personally, using the BTCC as an example of the civic being class leading, is not going to work I must say. I look at it, and there are 4 other models which are more likely to win before the CTR is even given a shot.</div></blockquote>ok, maybe they didn't do well enuff to clinch the top spots, but u gotta at least give them some credit for hanging with the best of the lot. as much as they were ranked 5th below the contis, there were other contis ranked below them as well.<br><br>on the other hand, i beg to differ that the success of the DC5 was largely attributed to the driving abilities of matt alone. i think there were inherent advantages of switching camps to a DC5 such as lower CG and lighter body shell. something that is also evident on our normal road going versions.</div>

Oh he has done well in other cars before. His won in a rather crap Nissan Primera. That shows how good he is I think. I believe if he'd been offered a properly supported conti drive, he would have won lots more championships. As it is, he was always the privateer, without factory backing. This driver has not had good cars in his past career, even so, he manhandled a piece of junk to win. I think that says a lot about how much of a factor he is in the current winning combination. U also have to look at how everyone else is doing in the other ITRs and the CTRs also, to know he's a bigger factor than u give him credit for.<br><br>If we look CAREFULLY at the sort of contis honda was racing against, then u wouldn't look so deep into it. Seriously hor, the 2001 gen hondas were racing the 1998 Vauxhalls used by the private teams. If a newer car cannot even beat a design 3 years older than itself, i think its even more sia suay, isn't it? The hondas were competitive alright. competitive against uncompetitive machinery. thats the only reason the hondas got as many points as they did. by fielding a LOT of cars, and by the dint that most of the contis were very old vauxhalls, and a quad of uncompetitive Lexuses. Now if the whole field was running with say... the newer gen Astra, I'd imagine that to be a very different story.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Wooooo can u imagine where Honda would have ended up then? with the privateer astras snatching points from them, they wouldn't even have finished above Seat, even with Seat only having 3 or 4 cars!<br><br>Actually that brings me to another pt. Seat with 3 or 4 cars only against almost half of a whole field of hondas, yet where teams was concerned, they came in ahead of honda in 04. the only reason they were below in the constructors was because they didn't field more cars. imagine, if the field had a lot more seats also.... i can't imagine where honda would be in the construtors... it'd be tragic! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>honestly, yes, what u say does makes me rethink my opinion yes. everytime i have to dig out more facts, everytime i have to rethink, the bar sinks lower. i beseech u to stop before i run out of ground clearance to lower my opinion of the civic any further  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>hmm... interesting about the S2K. actually i was thinking pitting it against the Beemers in WTCC would be more interesting! Of course seeing as the beemer is also heavier and RWD, which basically means it shares a lot of the disadvantages of the S2k, and yet won the WTCC championship last year, means a lot of those points are probably moot. Also considering how the cars in BTCC and WTCC are almost similiar (the same Seat Leon Rs r in both) If Honda can somehow get a racing version homologated, why not? Spoon HAS GT versions of S2Ks if i remember correctly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. R18 is i-Vtec (cam phase +cam change)<br>2. <strong>Cam phase is also know as VVTi(toyota/Suzuki),AVCS(subaru),VTC(nissan) it is actually cheap easy tech pioneered by Ford in 1962</strong><br>3. Cam change pioneered by Honda in 1980s<br>4. Vtec patent ended abt 5 years back; till date only Porsche,BMW and Toyota has successfully adopted Vtec system in their cars.<br>5. Toyota's "i-Vtec" is VVTi-L last seen in Celica SSII 1.8 Block. Now discontinued as it is too complicated and expensive to produce. VVTi-L now reserved in expensive Lexus range<br>6. BMW's new inline 6 engine (R6) uses digital Vtec system; again complicated and heavy, they solved by incorporating aluminium alloy.<br>7. Honda's relevance is that it is still the only car manufacturer to introduce true racing technology at affordable prices (unless you consider Porsche, BMW are cheap)<br>8. Choice between SOHCorDOHC is just power, if you can get the same power from a SOHC then of coz SOHC. (Notice Honda's SOHC pumps out more power than most DOHC) DOHC also more complicated and higher FuelConsumption. Plus point for DOHC is more receptive to modding due to its extra head.<br>9. overall comparing a BMW M3 with WRX STi/S2000/Evo not good; Price of 1 M3 can get you all 3 cars.<br><br>My 2 cents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
