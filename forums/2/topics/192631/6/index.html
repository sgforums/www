            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">Matt? Oh he has done well in other cars before. His won in a rather crap Nissan Primera. That shows how good he is I think. I believe if he'd been offered a properly supported conti drive, he would have won lots more championships. As it is, he was always the privateer, without factory backing. This driver has not had good cars in his past career, even so, he manhandled a piece of junk to win. I think that says a lot about how much of a factor he is in the current winning combination. U also have to look at how everyone else is doing in the other ITRs and the CTRs also, to know he's a bigger factor than u give him credit for.<br><br>If we look CAREFULLY at the sort of contis honda was racing against, then u wouldn't look so deep into it. Seriously hor, the 2001 gen hondas were racing the 1998 Vauxhalls used by the private teams. If a newer car cannot even beat a design 3 years older than itself, i think its even more sia suay, isn't it? The hondas were competitive alright. competitive against uncompetitive machinery. thats the only reason the hondas got as many points as they did. by fielding a LOT of cars, and by the dint that most of the contis were very old vauxhalls, and a quad of uncompetitive Lexuses. Now if the whole field was running with say... the newer gen Astra, I'd imagine that to be a very different story.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Wooooo can u imagine where Honda would have ended up then? with the privateer astras snatching points from them, they wouldn't even have finished above Seat, even with Seat only having 3 or 4 cars!<br><br>Actually that brings me to another pt. Seat with 3 or 4 cars only against almost half of a whole field of hondas, yet where teams was concerned, they came in ahead of honda in 04. the only reason they were below in the constructors was because they didn't field more cars. imagine, if the field had a lot more seats also.... i can't imagine where honda would be in the construtors... it'd be tragic! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>honestly, yes, what u say does makes me rethink my opinion yes. everytime i have to dig out more facts, everytime i have to rethink, the bar sinks lower. i beseech u to stop before i run out of ground clearance to lower my opinion of the civic any further  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>hmm... interesting about the S2K. actually i was thinking pitting it against the Beemers in WTCC would be more interesting! Of course seeing as the beemer is also heavier and RWD, which basically means it shares a lot of the disadvantages of the S2k, and yet won the WTCC championship last year, means a lot of those points are probably moot. Also considering how the cars in BTCC and WTCC are almost similiar (the same Seat Leon Rs r in both) If Honda can somehow get a racing version homologated, why not? Spoon HAS GT versions of S2Ks if i remember correctly.</div></blockquote>ur assumption that matt would do better in a conti remains as it is. an assumption. till such time that was proven, there is nothing to say that its his driving dat makes the most difference. i'm sure the more respectable conti teams would have loved to pilfer him by now for his skills and there has to be a reason y he chose to stick by a honda. looking at his current results in 2006, i dare say he made the right choice.<br><br>with regards to new technology losing to the old? if ur theory holds water, evos would be eating lancia delta s4's 4 breakfast. fact is, there are so many parameters in making a car go fast on track that it is virtually impossible to preclude the developments that a more "seasoned" car can undergo thoughout it's competitive lifespan. i'd think on the contrary, for a newcomer like the CTR or ITR for that matter, their initial results speaks volumes for their potential. who knows? they might dominate the championship one fine day if they had been given the same time that the contis had to refine their machineries.<br><br>u wanna compare past results? historically, hondas have had more pole positions and podium results than seat. 155 podiums versus a pathetic 45 for seat. in fact, the only conti brand that even comes close to honda is renault and the only conti brand that has ever bettered honda's 155 podiums is vauxhall. u tell me thats because they fielded more cars? i think u are just tailoring ur comparison to suit ur arguments. fact is, honda has been holding its weight against the contis in the btcc for well over a decade now.<br><br>yup, spoon does have a hard top GT version of the s2k participating in their domestic races. i think having the s2k in the WTCC would be a great platform for honda to enter the fray but apparently, none of the folks there seem interested at the moment. its a shame actually. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The years he spent plugging uncompetitive machinery probably put him out of the radar of these teams till recently. Then now he has a car reliable enough to win the championship, why not? Until last year, Yvan Muller, and a few other guys were more than capable of giving him a run for his money, and it makes sense for a team to stick with the ace they know.<br><br>new technology to dominate the old? no no. new technology DOES dominate the old, which is why honda did as well as they did with the CTR. There are 2 distincts here. the CTR didn't do as well as it should have. the ITRs are doing well no doubt, but its mainly Matt Neals' which is doing well, which shows that his driver skills contribute a lot to the combination.<br><br>honda has more pole n podiums over seat? of course of course!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> seat took such a long break from BTCC! they only rejoined in 2003 again, and during this time honda not notching up those stats then they doing what?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>u say honda have held their own weight against contis in the past, that is no doubt. however, im telling u the CTR didn't hold their weight as well, and that is true. If u compare how they did with how the ITRs are doing now, no doubt even u have to admit they could have done better, and disappointed a bit. If it wasn't disappointing, nobody would have switched to the ITRs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
