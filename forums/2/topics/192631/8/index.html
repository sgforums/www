The technology first appeared on Honda's K-series four cylinder engine family in 2002. Valve lift and duration are still limited to distinct low and high rpm profiles, but the intake camshaft is now capable of advancing between 25 and 50 degrees (depending upon engine configuration) during operation. Phase changes are implemented by a computer controlled, oil driven adjustable cam gear. Phasing is determined by a combination of engine load and rpm, ranging from fully retarded at idle to maximum advance at full throttle and low rpms. The effect is further optimization of torque output, especially at low and midrange RPMs.<br><br><strong>In 2004, Honda introduced an i-VTEC V6 (an update of the venerable J-series), but in this case, i-VTEC had nothing to do with cam phasing.</strong> Instead, i-VTEC referred to Honda's cylinder deactivation technology which closes the valves on one bank of (3) cylinders during light load and low speed (below 80 mph) operation. The technology was originally introduced to the US on the Honda Odyssey, and can now be found on the Honda Accord Hybrid and the 2006 Honda Pilot. An additional version of i-VTEC was introduced on the 2006 Honda Civic's R-series four cylinder engine. This implementation uses very small valve lifts at low rpm and light loads, in combination with large throttle openings (modulated by a drive-by-wire throttle system), to improve fuel economy by reducing pumping losses.<br><br>With the continued introduction of vastly different i-VTEC systems, one may assume that the term is now a catch all for creative valve control technologies from Honda.<br><br>2. like u said.. it is introduced in k20a engine... but k20a is a DOHC found in the integra... if cam phasing were to be introduced in a sohc.. wldnt it be complicated...<br><br>3. i believe toyota is bigger than honda..no offence... its primed to take over GM as world no.1 auto maker.  toyota also had a similar ivtec tt has cam phasing and cam changing( the thing tt alters lift) in the form of vvtl-i found in the celica... in fact vvtl-i is introudced 2 years earlier than the one found on the k20a unit.... as ernie has said toyota dun find it economical sensible to mass produce such engines...if a car maker as big as toyota cant find a way to successfully market this high tech engine.. do u think honda a smaller car maker can.. and if honda made ivtec with cam phasing mainstream.. wun it be losing money big time... yes honda cars are more ex than toyota's u might argue.. but ernie said tt toyota is reserving vvtl-i for its lexus range... if any... do u think a 10k plus premium btw a honda and toyota car can cover the cost of production and develpoment of the engine... and also how will toyota face the industry if honda can make a similar thing economically viable while toyota failed... so now the score is 1-1.. honda has this in the integra and toyota has this in the celica...<br><br>this 3 points made me conclude tt the new R18A1 need not neccesarily has cam phasing and most prob wun... regarding the US lawsuit ernie point out tt i also dunno how to explain... if u can translate jap maybe i can read what the website tt ernie has posted is saying...and if u still think i do not know what cam phasing is... so be it.. if u wanna agrue some more.. i can pm u my msn...

The technology first appeared on Honda's K-series four cylinder engine family in 2002. Valve lift and duration are still limited to distinct low and high rpm profiles, but the intake camshaft is now capable of advancing between 25 and 50 degrees (depending upon engine configuration) during operation. Phase changes are implemented by a computer controlled, oil driven adjustable cam gear. Phasing is determined by a combination of engine load and rpm, ranging from fully retarded at idle to maximum advance at full throttle and low rpms. The effect is further optimization of torque output, especially at low and midrange RPMs.<br><br>[b]In 2004, Honda introduced an i-VTEC V6 (an update of the venerable J-series), but in this case, i-VTEC had nothing to do with cam phasing. Instead, i-VTEC referred to Honda's cylinder deactivation technology which closes the valves on one bank of (3) cylinders during light load and low speed (below 80 mph) operation. The technology was originally introduced to the US on the Honda Odyssey, and can now be found on the Honda Accord Hybrid and the 2006 Honda Pilot. An additional version of i-VTEC was introduced on the 2006 Honda Civic's R-series four cylinder engine. This implementation uses very small valve lifts at low rpm and light loads, in combination with large throttle openings (modulated by a drive-by-wire throttle system), to improve fuel economy by reducing pumping losses.<br><br>With the continued introduction of vastly different i-VTEC systems, one may assume that the term is now a catch all for creative valve control technologies from Honda.[/b][/quote]<br><br>so u have conveniently cut and pasted one whole chunk of info on wad i-vtec does and wad vehicles are equipped with them......<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by n0x:<br><strong><br>2. like u said.. it is introduced in k20a engine... but k20a is a DOHC found in the integra... if cam phasing were to be introduced in a sohc.. wldnt it be complicated...</strong></div></blockquote><strong>casually implied that cam phasing is exclusive to a DOHC i-vtec engine.....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by n0x:</div><div class="quote_body">3. i believe toyota is bigger than honda..no offence... its primed to take over GM as world no.1 auto maker.  toyota also had a similar ivtec tt has cam phasing and cam changing( the thing tt alters lift) in the form of vvtl-i found in the celica... in fact vvtl-i is introudced 2 years earlier than the one found on the k20a unit.... as ernie has said toyota dun find it economical sensible to mass produce such engines...if a car maker as big as toyota cant find a way to successfully market this high tech engine.. do u think honda a smaller car maker can.. and if honda made ivtec with cam phasing mainstream.. wun it be losing money big time... yes honda cars are more ex than toyota's u might argue.. but ernie said tt toyota is reserving vvtl-i for its lexus range... if any... do u think a 10k plus premium btw a honda and toyota car can cover the cost of production and develpoment of the engine... and also how will toyota face the industry if honda can make a similar thing economically viable while toyota failed... so now the score is 1-1.. honda has this in the integra and toyota has this in the celica...</div></blockquote>followed on by bringing in a completely different car manufacturer using similar technology in a comparison using economics......<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by n0x:</div><div class="quote_body">this 3 points made me conclude tt the new R18A1 need not neccesarily has cam phasing and most prob wun... regarding the US lawsuit ernie point out tt i also dunno how to explain... if u can translate jap maybe i can read what the website tt ernie has posted is saying...and if u still think i do not know what cam phasing is... so be it.. if u wanna agrue some more.. i can pm u my msn... </div></blockquote>before come up with conclusion that the R18 "most prob wun" have cam phasing? sure didn't convince me dude.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>and for the record, i'm not here to argue with anyone. if u had valid points to convince me that u knew more about i-vtec or how cam phasing works, i might be less inclined to challenge ur views.<br></strong></div>
