            <div class='col-md body'>hello everyone,<br>didnt know i would create such a commotion. My sincerest apologies if you happen to be offended by my car. I already kinda expected this kind of reaction, therefor i have already tried approaching the foodcourt looking down on the floor, to avoid others from thinking i am a "yaya papaya". Lets not drag parents into the issue and have a little respect for one another. I believe all our parents have sacrificed alot to bring us up. They are all great, the way i see it. If using my mobile phone while driving when a phone call comes in, i guess i will have to refrain from using it. I guess opening my top on an open top car is offensive and show off too. Perhaps i should have stayed with my evo instead of changing cars. Oh, i guess the same has happened before with my old yellow evo. Whatever the case is. Why make yourself upset over some one else's actions? But i guess the lesson learnt here is that there will always be people you offend, no matter what you do. Now that you are so unhappy, and making such a commotion, what do you expect out of this situation? You wanna rough it out like "ah bengs"? and get both parties injured? and then what? you want an apology from me? here it is. I really hope this satisfies you. Perhaps one day when you earn some money u will handle the money in a more humble manner, for example: putting it in a bank and staring at it.</div>

U r jus simply being disrespectful to someone whose his parents might have bought him a nice car. In wad way does he deserve looking down by you?

If the rest of you here may agree, this guy is not making sense in whatever he is saying. Perhaps it is the poor english or my poor reading skills. Your last post does not refer to my post in any way. And you have avoided the point of whether you bought the car yourself, bought by your parents, or with the aid of your parents. your anger or jealousy, has brought you forward to blurt unreadable posts. This has its comedic qualities. If you have been paying attention my boy, i have owned up to be the owner, despite your ferocious and "scary" posts.<br><br>I have a friend whos is 20 and he bought a WRX himself. It just goes to show how some people can be capable and some not.<br>Taking reference to your last post. yes, cars are all similar, and people are too. except there are lambo's and <strong>TS</strong>'s, human alike, there are the better ones, and there are the "not so better one's". And similar to this case, there are the normal ones, and there are those who choose to make a fool out of themselves. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a good example at hand. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If our "subject" is unable to comprehand what i have written, pls ask and i will break it down to simpler english.<br><br>Pardon me, i really hate to show off to people, i think it is wrong to do so. My friends know what kind of character i have, and those who know it can stand up to what i am saying. But i dont really care what you think Eviljustice, cause you are a nobody to me. If my .<strong>1</strong> car travelling at less than 15km/h can piss you off like that, maybe one day me and my friends maybe <strong>10</strong> or more zoom past, you might suffer a stroke and intense spasm in your <strong>TS</strong><br>have a good day, i pray that no one zooms past you at anthing more than 15km/h, it might kill.<br><br>This will be my last post, as this is a waste of time. My friend told me abt this jealous person making remarks, so curiosity has brought me here. My advice to all of us is to simply leave him alone. This will nv come to an end. I believe many of us have better things to do</div>
