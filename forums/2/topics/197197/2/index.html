The interest rate quoted by car agents are flat add-on basis i.e 3.25% x loan principle x tenure, so the effective interest rate which is the interest u r actually paying r somwhere in the region of 6%.<br><br>The interest rebate will always come with tie-in period which u cannot redeem yr loan for watever reason without re-paying back the cash rebate pro-rata. Comparing apple to apple it just depend on yr preference: whether u prefer cash upfront rebate or saving on add-on interest by getting a lower interest rate. Do yr maths and u shld realized that no matter which package u take, the bank still earn roughly the same.<br>On top of tat, when u sell-off yr car b4 u finish re-paying the bank, u will lose some money under rule78 less 20% admin charge even if u r govn under hire purchase act.

            <div class='col-md body'>Agents do receive loan commissions from finance institutions(FI) for recommendations of loans. In the event that you pay full cold hard cash for the car, the agent actually earns very little commission from the sale of the car alone. Yet, they have to undertake the hassle of importing the car into SG, liasing with various parties and such. Agents mostly earn from a combination of these factors: sale of car, loan commissions from FI and insurance commissions from insurance companies. Thus if you do not take a loan out from their affiliated FI, there is a penalty involved, since they want to earn anyway.<br><br><a href="http://www.askdrmoney.com/Ruleof78.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrmoney.com/Ruleof78.htm</a><br>Go see the above webby for further reasons why the banks want you to take out a loan.
