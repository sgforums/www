            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings all bros,<br><br>IÂ’ve seen so many threads cursing and swearing about bad driving, inconsiderate driving, selfish driving etc.<br><br>Besides all that, I am sure there are some good encounters by all bros here also, right? Why not we share them here also?<br><br>IÂ’ve come across many nice drivers who give way, signal early, keep to lane 2 after overtaking etc.<br><br>About two hours ago, while I was on CTE heading towards AMK Avenue 5 (after the flyover), I was on lane 2 and I need to keep to lane 3 in order to make an exit to Avenue 5. As usual there are many lorries and vans on lane 3 and I barely have space to move in. So I thought I could move in later. 300 meters left before the exit and still with my left turn signal on, I still canÂ’t find space (they seems to be tailgating). Fortunately, with 100 meters left, thereÂ’s this comfort taxi, slowed down and high beam at me at the same time, as if he was trying to tell me Â“Hey dude, hereÂ’s your chanceÂ”. And finally I managed to exit safely.<br><br>Now, I know whatÂ’s in your mind, youÂ’d probably be thinking the reason he high beamed me because heÂ’s pissed off at me? No! Because while he was heading straight (not to exit) on lane 3, I managed to wave (saying thank you) at him on my right and he replied by nodding his head gently, with a warm smile.<br><br>So now letÂ’s all share your sweet encounters, shall we?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
