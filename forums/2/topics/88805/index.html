But in the IS200 the intitial pick-up note is a little raspier. Idle speed should be around 700+ rpm....too low could also result in some vibration.<br><br>One more thing....try with your air-con compressor on and off...the engine noise most probably is the compressor. If so, it is better to have the air-con checked by BM technician......probably nothing but just to be safe....so u can get the 2nd dealer to rectify any problems before taking over the car  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Yes there will be some wind noise above 100km/hr.....perfectly normal. Additional insulation not really required....only adds uneccessary weight to the car.....rather when its time to change your tyres....look for a quiter model. The main road intrusion will be tyre 'roar'....can solve with careful tyre selection.<br><br>Sports version.....no enhancement in power but think some skirting and 17 inch sport rims.....purely aesthetics.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope its not too late for replies...<br><br>Yes thats right, according to Saab95, the only difference is the exterior, i.e. full body skirtings, bigger exhaust pipe, metallic pads, etc.<br><br>Otherwise, engine specs. are the same.<br><br>Anyway, anyone out there into tuning the IS200? Yes I'm talking abt the LEXUS version only please.<br><br>I've been to quite a few places but sadly they don't fit in this car.<br><br>However, I like to share something to those who may not have notice.<br><br>Notice there's a big spacious space on the left hand side of the engine? Looks weird?? Not at all, this space is meant for a TurBo Charger. Heard it's quite difficult to find this item and the best thing is it's LTA approved. Price wise...should range not more than S$15k.<br><br>I appreciate if anyone can provide useful information.

Looks like there r both SuperCharger &amp; Turbo-Charger available(LTA Compliant). Great News but the Mod costing 10-15k is quite hard to stomache leh..... Tink after the mOD petrol Consumption would go down to say 7-8km/l or worse?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>By the way the previous Owner of the LTA Approved Super-Charged IS200 sold off his ride already. Could it be due to the high FC? Curious Curious as i tink he juz spend a bomb to get it done.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

Nice guy.<br><br>Bought my ride direct from a Owner who upgraded to a RX300.<br>My Yearly Dep for the IS200 is ard 7.5k/yr as well.

Normal svs won't cost more than $200 for a 10k Full Syn package. I service my ride at my Mechanic Wkshop as quite a number of Lexus does svs at his place in AMK Autopoint.<br>Very happy with the car though. I personally rate in 8.5/10  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was this comparison in AUTOCAR ASIAN edition some time back between the IS200, 318i and C200 kompressor. I cant remember who came out tops but the biggest seller was the 318i. All these are actually being called "yuppie" cars cos most of the drivers are young dudes who dont save money. haha. anyway after that article came out some fella wrote in to say that for around that price u could get an Evo (vii at that time) so i was also thinking why pple wanna buy IS200... it doesnt look all that nice, it's accessories are quite limited to those chiong type and looks a bit beng beng also the rear lights transparent. nowadays a lot of evo6 series mit lancer also put those rear light very ugly...</div>
