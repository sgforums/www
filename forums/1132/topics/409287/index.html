Sometimes, it happens many times a day, sometimes for weeks or months I would not come across the sound.<br><br>The most popular scientific explanation is the expansion and contraction of pipes in the house. I don't think it is a satisfactory answer though, it doesn't sound anything like what a pipe would sound like, it really DOES sound like real marbles. A paranormal explanation would be ghosts playing with marbles, or a mundane explanation is real kids playing with real marbles (though the people living above me are an old couple with no kids).<br><br>Have you guys had experience with the "marble sound"?

              <p>More specifically, the water hammer effect.</p>
              <p>One of my professors is a pro on the effects of unsteady water flow. He explained to my class that the acoustic frequency of the oscillations during the phenomenon (which occurs when valves are suddenly closed) have been known to coincide with that of marbles dropping on the floor.</p>

              <p>I'm just quoting what API determined from their investigation, hence I provided the link, if you bothered to read till the end of it.</p>
              <p>It doesn't sound like much, but if its acoustic signature is transferred from one medium to another, it will sound alot different from what is expected.</p>
              <p>I understand the waterhammer effect from studies, usually the sound of waterhammer effect is thumping, and is more evident in the kitchen and bathroom areas.</p>
              <p>Waterhammer effect can be eliminated just by using the turn taps as opposed to the quick on/off types.</p>
              <p>As for me, I live on the high floor, so I can hear the booster pump working on demand at night, when the motor revs up everytime there is demand below.</p>

              <p>i read up some things about this problem last time. If i'm not wrong, it is related to physics.</p>
              <p>HDB flats have pipes and metal rods running between the ceiling and upstairs floor<br>the material actually does contract and expand due to the temperature so sometimes at night when it cools down, the marble-dropping sound is actually from the metal contracting.</p>
              <p>I can't remember where i read from but there is a prove on it. Just lazy to find it out.</p>

              <h1 class="subject">Weird tapping and "marble dropping" noises in my apartment? What is it?</h1>
              <div class="content">I've been moved in to my new apartment for just a few weeks. Last night I heard some strange noises before going to bed around 10:30 and then were woken up by them again in the early morning (3:00am). There are two different sounds. The most common is a tapping/cracking sort of sound in the wall. For awhile it happened about every 5 seconds, but it happened randomly too. The other sound I only heard about four times. It is a weird "marble dropping" sound, so it basically sounded like someone dropped a ball or marble and it bounces a little and rolls. It seems to come from the same wall. I'm on the top floor (3rd) and the wall where the noises is just leads to a stairwell. I live in a northern state with cold climate. I also had the heater on a bit higher than usual last night. Could that be it? The building is only about 25 years old. Please don't say it is ghosts! That freaks me out. I'd prefer a logical explanation if there is one to have.</div>

              <p>I've heard furniture shifting at 3am, footsteps, and marbles. common stuff... but i remembered once, shouting at 3am after being awaken by the sound of footsteps from the floor above... it stopped and started again 5 minutes later at a much much faster pace. i just went back to sleep and ignored it.</p>
