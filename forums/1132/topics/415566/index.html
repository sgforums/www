              <p>A persons beingness is consisting of conscious and unconscious part. To know oneself seriously, there is a need to be aware of both the conscious and the unconscious parts. The conscious parts are the aspect of ourself that we recognise. The unconscious are the part that one is not consciously aware of.</p>
              <p>To understand ourself, all parts must be made awared. Often the unconscious part of oneself manifest events in life that are largely unpleasant.</p>
              <p>There are multiple ways to know the unconscious parts.</p>

              <p>One way to discover the unconscious part is to take note of one's dream. There are many kinds of dreams, but the common ones can reveal much about ourselves.</p>
              <p>With regards to the dream content,  the different characters can be considered as <strong>symbolic representation</strong>s 
                                  pertaining to certain values or meanings that we hold. Typically, the 
                                  different characters in a dream can very likely be some kind of symbolic
                                   representation of parts of our character who may be unconscious. </p>
              <p>So, for example if we see a monster in the dream, the monster may be representing certain part of ourself. If we see a baby, the baby also represent certain part of ourselve.</p>
              <p>There are some 'standard' symbols that we need to be familar with;</p>
              <p>water - this is symbolic of our emotion. Ocean means our subconscious emotion. A very common dream is jumping into or swimming in the ocean. This mean accessing the subsconscious emotion.</p>
              <p>The emotion that is felt in the dream is also an important clue for interpretation. For example fear from falling into the ocean means afraid of feeling the subconscious emotion.</p>
              <p>dinosaur -  old patterns, habits and beliefs. Chased and hunted by dinosaur means that old habits, patterns are causing one's difficulty... need to be aware of these old habits.</p>

              <p>It is important to understand that what we think we are do not represent the total aspects of ourselves. What one believe his/her personality is like is just a mental image of what he/she like to think about himself/herself. It is not reflective of the entire spectrum of one's pattern and behavioural tendencies.</p>
              <p>The unconscious aspects includes parts of personality that is outside the definition of what one think/believe his/her personality is like. During the process of discovering the unconscious aspect of oneself, there will be lots of surprising and even shocking findings.</p>
              <p>In the process of self-discovery, suspending one's assumption is a skill required for further understanding</p>

              <p>During this crucial period, if you have recurring dreams of falling down stairs, falling from a cliff, falling from the sky or taking elevators down into some unpleasant places, it'll be good to take note of the surroundings and circumstances of the entire dream, to give you more hints of any relevance to your real life. Usually, the objects are metaphoric, and everyone should be able to decipher the meanings ourselves, if we pay more attention to details of what is going on in our life, and find the connections between our dreams and our actual life.</p>
              <p><strong>Recurring</strong> dreams of constantly falling down in your dream could be a guidance to you, from well-meaning entities watching over your life, such your your Spirit Guides, or your own Higher Self/Soul, that you may not be making the most appropriate choices in your normal daily life, that may lead you to 'fall down' in future. On the other hand, if you dream of taking elevator/stairs upwards, especially into the sky, it's a good thing for your future ahead... :)</p>

              <p><em>1) Is it a good sign that we hardly dream while sleeping
                      ?</em></p>
              <p>No good no bad. neutral ;)</p>
              <p><em>2) What does it mean when we dream of ghosts ?</em></p>
              <p>Ghosts do not alway refer to real ghost. Ghost is the symbol of the part of you that is unconscious/unknown to you. This means that a hidden aspect of yourself is about to make known to you, if you catch the opportunity. Ghost is therefore a good sign that you may be able to integrate a previously unknown part of you. But you must be alert during the waking hours to 'discover' that part of yourself. :)</p>
              <p><em>3) What does it mean when we dream of someone is dead ? I always
                      dream of someone close to me or someone that I do not know passed
                      away but the dream did not come true.</em></p>
              <p>As mentioned, anyone in the dream is the aspect of yourself. To dream that someone is died means that a habit or patterns of yourself is being gradually resolved thus dying. This is great !</p>
              <p>You ask very insight questions.</p>

              <p>As mentioned previously, dream analysis is not the only way to discover the unconscious aspects of being. Some other ways include methods such as and known as soul retrieval, etc.</p>
              <p>However, for finer levels of uncovering the subconscious/unconscious, one will have to switch to mindfulness practices such as Vipassana or insight meditation.</p>
              <p>This level deals with the minds dynamic directly head-on and in real time, allowing the person to take note and be aware of the moment-to-moment experiences. With no or little unconscious impedence at the moment, experiences can arise and passes away on their own. This is becuase at the insight level practice, the workings of the 'sense of self/ego' can be seen. This 'self' in itself is a very subtle and deep unconsciousness.</p>
