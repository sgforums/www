              <p>"With 25 million people in its path, Super Typhoon Haiyan -- one of the strongest storms recorded on the planet -- smashed into the Philippines on Friday morning. With sustained winds of 315 kph (195 mph) and gusts as strong as 380 kph (235 mph), Haiyan was probably the strongest tropical cyclone to hit land anywhere in the world in recorded history."</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">As I've shared several times in the last few years, Earth will be experiencing increasingly major disasters which are inevitable, as part of Earth's ongoing changes and transformation. There is a growing need for people with the abilities, skills and experience to help in such situations. </span></p>
              <p>There is a certain percentage of people on Earth who are able to help reduce the impact of disasters or know about disasters in advance, but are not aware of their natural psychic abilities yet. I've already helped a couple of them in Singapore remember what they can do, or are meant to do, with regards to such calamities. If you or someone you know always have this inner feeling that you are required to help with disaster situations, do drop me a mail/message.</p>

              <p>I've helped people who know about certain disasters in advance. I also know of people who can reduce the impact of disasters, in time to come, as they are not ready yet now. </p>
              <p>For people whose life purposes involve helping in disasters, they will somehow feel very uncomfortable reading news about disasters, and prior to disasters, they can feel very "different". </p>
              <p>People who have various psychic abilities to help in disasters areas, either now or in the coming years when the intensity and frequency of natural disasters increase, often have past lives carrying out the same role as well. People often need many lifetimes to practise and master their psychic abilities, to be ready for what they eventually need to do.<br><br>This lifetime is a very unique lifetime in Earth's evolutionary process, as I've explained several times over the years. People need to remember what their life purposes are, and get working on them. If people's soul contracts have specified timelines with regards to their life purpose, very major and sudden events (eg. major illness or life issue) could happen suddenly to trigger the need for action and remembrance of their life purpose. </p>
