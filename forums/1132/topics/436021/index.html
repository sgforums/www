              <p>You all should watch incredible tales. Last time was shown on channel 5, now is on every Monday at channel 8. They were true stories. Those people involved were on screen talking about their experiences. Some have 3rd eyes.</p>
              <p>I heard from my friend, it happened at  a 24 hour shop near her place. The girl who worked mid night shift during seventh month, discovered there were hell notes among her earnings the next morning. The shop has CCTV, they replayed it and suspected it was a young lady ghost.</p>

              <p>The saying that ghosts let out from hell during the 7th month does not come from Buddhism. It is from Taoism. Buddhists believe that when a person dies, if he did not rebirth in Buddha's Pureland, he will be reborn as ghost, hell, animals, humans, heavenly gods or dem-gods.</p>
              <p>So, there are only wondering spirits (those who became ghosts after death) or hell beings. Buddhists do not believe that  hell beings are being released to earth in 7th month.</p>

              <p>No, hell beings are different from ghosts. They are beings suffering in hell because of their past deeds. In Buddhism, we don't believe that hell is forever. All the 6 reincarnation paths (hell, ghosts, animals, heaven, humans, dem-gods)) are  impermanent. Each will stay in their path till their good or bad karma is depleted.</p>
              <p>Just like we humans, we don't live forever. Each has different life span, depends on our good and bad karma. Likewise for heaven, unlike other religions which believe that hell and heaven are forever (eternity), Buddhism does not believe in that. Thus, the best is to get out of these 6 reincarnation paths as it is very suffering. You won't know where you will be going next.</p>

              <p>I have a friend whose husband is a property agent. According to her, property agents have a shared list of which properties are haunted. My friend ask me to check with her if I wish to purchase any property. She knows which are the haunted ones.</p>
              <p>According to some property agents, the most haunted place in our house is the store room because it is dark.</p>

              <p>This is a real story......</p>
              <p>Question : Where do you think you are lightly to see a ghost? In a cemetry or in a temple?</p>
              <p>There was once we had a overnight topography exercise. We had to go to various check point in order to complete our exercise. We had a long day and ended up at the last checkpoint in Mandai forest. Our rest area was near the Mandai cemetry. We had to sleep there for the night.</p>
              <p>My buddy Ah Boon insisted that we should sleep in the temple beside the cemetry than among the tombstones in the cemetry. He says that it is "cleaner" there. I had no objection so we slept in the temple instead.</p>
              <p>In the middle of the night, Ah Boon woke me up. He looked frightened and asked me if I hear anyone crying outside the temple. I looked at him in suprised and told him I heard none. He then asked me to go back to sleep. As I turned my back against him, I could hear mumbling from him. I was too tired to stay awake and soon fall back to sleep.</p>
              <p>The next morning, Ah Boon told me that he had heard crying from some wandering spirit pleading outside the temple asking for help to find them a "home" so that they will no longer be wandering spirit. As there were 2 guardian god painted on the door, the wandering spirits were not able to enter. The mumbling I heard from Ah Boon were his chanting to keep the spirit away.</p>
              <p>The end....</p>
              <p>The moral of the story?.....</p>
              <p>Stay away from the temple near the cemetry.</p>

              <p>This is a true story......name have been changed to protect the victim.</p>
              <p>Mr Vincent Tan was a successful contractor. However he too was a dishonest and unscrupulous man who would cheat his sub-contractor. He had always boast that his success was because his father was buried in a good fengshui ground.</p>
              <p>Vincent saw that the economy was heading for a recession. So he took on a large project to keep his company going while others will be thirsty for jobs during that period. He would then offer the jobs at a very low price to his subcontractors. He was a bad paymaster and forced them to take on his other projects otherwise he will not pay them promptly.</p>
              <p>Ah How was one such subcontractor. In order to get his payment back, he took on Vincent other jobs. But this in turn cause him to be owe even more money by Vincent. As Vincent didn't pay him his due, Ah How was unable to pay his workers and his suppliers. Ah How was finally forced to be bankrupt by his suppliers and his company folded. Vincent was of course very happy as he need not pay Ah How for all his work anymore and he had make a bigger profit without any effort. Ah How promised revenge and Vincent laughed him off.</p>
              <p>A year passed and Vincent business started to turn bad. His family was not at peace. His wife would often quarrel with him and his son was involved in bad companies. His daughter would often fall sick and claimed that she was seeing things at home. Soon Vincent's daughter became too sick and passed away. Vincent was at wits end.</p>
              <p>Finally, Vincent went on to seek an advice from a medium and the medium told him that his father's grave was being disturbed. Vincent rushed to his father's burial ground but could not see anything wrong. So he went back to the medium for advice. The medium was very certain that the father's burial ground was disturbed and advice him to "open" up his father grave.</p>
              <p>When Vincent finally dug up his father's grave, he found that was another coffin on top of his father's coffin. Vincent's father grave was thus disturbed and his family was thus affected. Vincent removed that coffin and reburied his fathers but all was too late as the fengshui was broken. Vincent's business failed and he had to resort to borrowing to keep going. That lead to ah long going after him for blood.</p>
              <p>Rumours soon started to spread that Ah How was the one who did it......that's still to be proven....</p>
              <p>The end...</p>

              This is a true story ......
              
              During my NS days, I was posted to chua chu kang camp. One weekend, i had to book in before 2359 hours. As I had attended some realitive's weeding, i checked in later than the usual. It was not usual of me to booked in this late but i had no choice. I never like to come in late because of all the cemetries nearby. These roads are pretty dark and quiet and of course spooky.
