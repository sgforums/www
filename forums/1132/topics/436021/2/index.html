              <p>I heard from my friend, it happened at  a 24 hour shop near
              her place. The girl who worked mid night shift during seventh
              month, discovered there were hell notes among her earnings the next
              morning. The shop has CCTV, they replayed it and suspected it

              <p>Okay.let me clarify for you.FIRSTLY,there are more ghosts on earth during the 7th month IS VERY TRUE.SECONDLY,it is NOT TRUE that ghosts will refuse to go back to hell as it will be punished when found out.THIRDLY,there are wondering spirits OR GHOSTS on earth and they are LOST on earth as they are too  æ‰§è‘—  on one thing so they could not get out of the earth.</p>

              <p>This is a real story......</p>
              <p>Question : Where do you think you are lightly to see a ghost? In
              a cemetry or in a temple?</p>
              <p>There was once we had a overnight topography exercise. We had to
              go to various check point in order to complete our exercise. We had
              a long day and ended up at the last checkpoint in Mandai
              forest. Our rest area was near the Mandai cemetry. We had to sleep
              there for the night.</p>
              <p>My buddy Ah Boon insisted that we should sleep in the
              temple beside the cemetry than among the tombstones in
              the cemetry. He says that it is "cleaner" there. I had no
              objection so we slept in the temple instead.</p>
              <p>In the middle of the night, Ah Boon woke me up. He looked
              frightened and asked me if I hear anyone crying outside the temple.
              I looked at him in suprised and told him I heard none. He then
              asked me to go back to sleep. As I turned my back against him, I
              could hear mumbling from him. I was too tired to stay awake and
              soon fall back to sleep.</p>
              <p>The next morning, Ah Boon told me that he had heard crying from
              some wandering spirit pleading outside the temple asking for help
              to find them a "home" so that they will no longer be wandering
              spirit. As there were 2 guardian god painted on the door, the
              wandering spirits were not able to enter. The mumbling I heard from
              Ah Boon were his chanting to keep the spirit away.</p>
              <p>The end....</p>
              <p>The moral of the story?.....</p>
              <p>Stay away from the temple near the cemetry.</p>

              <p>It is very true that the temple had more ghost than cemetery due to the reason the ghosts want to hear the prayers by the people so they will come.But it is very normal so have you notice there are no houses near the temple most of the time.</p>
              <p>That will solve your mystery or your question.</p>
              <p><strong>More infor you can look and investigate places with temples,are there HDB or private houses there??</strong></p>

              <p>I've just heard from my nephew that his school mate, a primary one student, saw a ghost in the toilet last week. He said the ghost's face was bloody. He told his teacher and soon all the teachers knew about it. My nephew's form teacher told them that may be the boy was lying. I understand from other parents that the school has many ghosts stories because there were students being knocked down by cars in front of the school.</p>
              <p>It is right that the teachers not to scare the students. I understand the students were warned not to use the toilets on the 4th floor where the boy saw the spirit.</p>

              <p>The mahjong ghost story:</p>
              <p>Do you play mahjong? Have you wonder why you keep losing in a mahjong game? Especially when you are on a losing streak, your card gets from bad to worse or just when you can recoup your losses with an excellent card set and then your opponent win the game with a minor win?</p>
              <p><img id="il_fi" style="padding-bottom: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px;" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_x9bPXf77xGc/ShJMfPwCrSI/AAAAAAAAFHk/vWt9JnlOSLQ/ghost23.jpg" alt="" width="739" height="415"></p>
              <p>Here's the story:</p>
              <p>Ah Boo was a mahjong addict. Whenever you are in need of a kaki, just call him and he will arrive, anywhere, anytime. But Ah Boo is always on a losing streak, because Ah Boo tend to get angry whenever he cannot game a big win. Ah Boo would slam his cards or angrily push the tiles away or sometime throws the tiles. Although everyone dislike his antic and told him off, he never listen.</p>
              <p>One day, Ah Boo's uncle gave him a charm and told him to swipe it on his eyes before the mahjong game. He told Ah Boo that he will see the reason why he's always on a losing streak. Ah Boo did that. Then he saw that there were mahjong ghost surrounding on the tables. These ghost would cling onto the table edges and peer thru the cards. Whenever Ah Boo slammed the cards against the edges of the table, these ghost would have their fingers slammed by the cards. Then these angry ghost would get angry and changed the cards that Ah Boo is supposed to draw into something else so that Ah Boo can never win.</p>
              <p>The end</p>
              <p>Moral of the story?</p>
              <p>Be a good loser, at least</p>
