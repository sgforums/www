              <p>OK.. i am not really very psychic.. but i have seen ghost before. Well, they are just like normal human but a bit 'dazed'... certainly not scary like in movies.</p>
              <p>However, i have also seen non-human entities (what you will define as demons). They are well... non-human.. different kind of lifeform.</p>

              <p><br>If you watch the last Harry Potter movie their is a deer that is light green and almost transparent and appears made of light. This is so near exactly clase ot what I saw once that it couldn't have been coincidence. They know exactly what these  ...things .... look like. What I saw wasn't a deer though,it was an old woman at the most 3 feet tall wearing a robe with a hoodie,skin clothes all the same light green colour</p>

              <p><br>    I have been surprised to find that it is not all that rare for someone to have seen a spirit. I certainly don't understand the spiritual realm but I talk quite freely about it as I know that many others also have but are usually very careful to speak of what they have witnessed</p>

              <p>Actually all of us has a third-eye chakra, just because that it is 
                  blocked/closed most of the time does not mean it is totally unavailable.</p>
              <p>If you are interested in opening your third eye, go view some youtube videos.<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jzj0aJqiqg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jzj0aJqiqg</a></p>
              <p>But
                   before you even start to clear your third eye, it is important that you
                   are pure at heart first. Your heart chakra is really the part that 
                  protects/heals you from harmful &amp; negative 
                  influence(mental+emotional).<br> <br> For me, its mixture of fun &amp; weird experiences. For example, I had 
                  once in a lifetime experience where I can see my enitre bedroom even 
                  when I am physically asleep.<br> I also had dreams of myself appearing in an entire different realm where
                   I can float/fly around, which is definitely nothing physical like 
                  Earth. It is not possible for me to write all my experiences down, it is 
                  better for you experience all these for yourself, then you will 
                  understand that I am not only one that can have similar experiences.</p>

              <p>What SoulDivine said about having a pure heart is very true. It makes the difference in how people are able to develop their psychic abilities, as well as what kind of experiences they have. That is why often we hear people everywhere saying all sorts of stuff about psychic abilities being pure imagination or myths, or that they tried to develop, but never experienced anything, or worse, had negative experiences instead of positive ones.</p>
              <p>Yet, there are others who have positive experiences. The difference often lies in their hearts. Of course, people who already had psychic abilities in previous lifetimes will be able to recall them much easier, if they are allowed to in this lifetime.</p>
              <p>If people intend to use their abilities for negative reasons, they will either not be allowed by the Universe (mainly their Spirit Guides) to develop their abilities properly, or they may end up having negative experiences, as Dark spiritual entities can tell who are the people they can influence. For people who intend to obtain psychic abilities for selfish reasons, or to harm or take advantage of others, I strongly recommend that it's best not to start. The outcomes would not be pleasant.</p>
