              <p>Don't be surprised if more and more ghosts or non-physical entities are trying to get your attention (in Singapore or any other country you may be in), to ask for help in moving on to the Light. We have already entered the period where all beings (humans, ghosts, etc) on Earth realm are being given opportunities or signals to prepare to leave this realm, one way or another. There are other Universal plans for this present 3D Earth realm ahead, as it has already served its Universal purpose long enough for letting so many beings learn through their life experiences on it.</p>
              <p>Ghosts, who have learnt to be less attached to their previous "alive" experiences, are seeking out people to ask for help in leaving this Earth realm properly. If the ghosts happen to be in the exact location of your home/office, those people they are trying to contact would be yourself, your family member or colleagues.</p>
              <p>Ghosts can do many things to get the attention of the living. Below are the more common ways:</p>
              <p>1) enable themselves to be seen: you may refer to my previous posting on how to sense  them (<a href="/forums/1132/topics/406094">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1132/topics/406094</a>)</p>
              <p>2) manipulate electrical equipment, eg. TV, radio, handphones, lights, etc. Reason is it's much easier for them to disrupt electrical energy, than physical objects.</p>
              <p>3) move physical objects: This is not that common, as it requires far more effort from them, as compared to electrical stuff.</p>
              <p>4) touch people, to let them know their presence: this is why some people feel as if someone or something is grabbing or touching their hands/legs/bodies, though no one is around. Sometimes, they may even sit on your sofa, chair or bed.</p>
              <p>5) attach themselves to a living person: this is often more subtle and most people are not even aware that they have "energetic attachments". All beings are basically energy. The effects of "energetic attachments" can range from increased emotions of irritation, uneasiness, anxiety, anger, depression, short-term memory loss. In more severe cases, people with such "energetic attachments" can become too depressed to the state of being suicidal.</p>
              <p>People need to understand that ghosts' consciousness is very different from when they were alive. Though most of them don't mean living people any harm, but they really are in a very confused state, and are somehow stuck in a time warp of the time when they died. If they died unpeacefully, they remain in that state as ghosts, where they still feel anger, fear, confused, threatened, abused, betrayed, etc.</p>
              <p>Ghosts are not able to rationalise properly like living people, as they only have memories of their final state. Communications with them can only be about topics relating to their final memories, eg. if they died because of being murdered, then we can talk to them about who murdered them, and advise them to forgive their murderer. But the ghost will not be able to communicate on other topics like the time when he/she last had outings with their families, etc, unless the ghost remained earthbound as a result of their over-strong attachment to their families.</p>
              <p>Spirits on the other hand are different, as they had already moved on to the Light successfully upon death, and merely returned to Earth realm to visit. They are considered safe and positive beings, and will have full memories of their previous life, unlike ghosts.</p>
              <p>There is no need to be afraid of ghosts or spirits, as long as people understand the reasons for their state of existence. Helping ghosts leave this Earth realm, and move on to the Light is of utmost compassion, and brings good karma to the people who choose to help them, one way or another.</p>

              <p><br>hehe.. trust me, people really shouldn't accept such <strong>material offers </strong>from ghosts or non-physical entities, as they are not capable of unconditional love (ie. care/concern). People will be expected to give something in return for their help, and normally, it will not be pleasant. The return favours are often not immediate, so people may not be aware of the consequences till much later in their life. :)</p>

              <p>Though what I'm going to say here may offend people, but I'll still say it. Too many people are not doing enough, or anything at all, to improve their character and heal themselves of their negative natures in this life when they are still living, and yet expect to enjoy their afterlife.</p>
              <p>Universal Law of Cause and Effect will <strong>guarantee</strong> that everyone experiences what they deserve, according to how they lead their lives. Many people who can obtain enough details of their past lives will be able to know the reason why they are suffering (or will be suffering) in this life is because of their past misdeeds in a previous life.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Life in Spiritual Realm:</span></strong></p>
              <p>Anyway, burning stuff (food and paper money / Mercedes cars / bungalows / clothes / iPhones / XBox / servants etc) does not do anything for the afterlife. What is burnt stays in this Earth realm as ashes and smoke. They are merely material possessions that some living people desire to bring with them to the afterlife after death. Seriously, we come to this world with nothing, and we leave this world with nothing. We have everything we need in the Spiritual Realm, in relation to our next phase of existence.</p>
              <p>Of course, what everyone goes through after death is different, depending on how they led their lives when there were still living, so they will have different experiences. If everyone can everything in the Spiritual Realm that is burnt to them after death, the Spiritual Realm will be one chaotic place filled with all sorts of luxuries, and everyone will have tons of money to spend in the spiritual casinos! :)</p>
              <p>The Spiritual Realm for most people is really a place of bliss and contentment, where people can reflect on what they did in their physical lives. Having to reincarnate into a physical life that is filled with compulsory sufferings for people to learn their life lessons or resolve karmic issues is often far more torturing.</p>
              <p>For those who need to reincarnate again, they (together with a Higher Council in the Spiritual Realm) will get to plan their next lives to learn or re-learn life lessons, in order to be better people. Materialism does not exist in the Spiritual Realm, unlike here on Earth.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ghosts stuck in Earth realm:</span></strong></p>
              <p>For ghosts still stuck in Earth realm, they lead very sad existences, as they are in a place where they don't belong anymore, and only retain memories of their last moments of their lives when they were still alive. Many of them are not even aware they are dead, and continue doing whatever they were doing as before. That's why sometimes, they are seen walking through solid walls, because when they were alive, there was no wall in that spot.</p>
              <p>Ghosts can be stuck in Earth realm for hundreds to thousands of years, until they are "rescued" by people who can help them move on to the Light. Imagine living in a world where the great majority of people cannot see/sense you, are unaware of your existence, and ignoring your cries for help, and you have no loved ones who can comfort you, and you only have negative emotions (fear, anger, confusion, etc), and have extremely limited memories left, all of which are mostly negative. Ghosts are stuck in their own 'loops', and so won't interact with other ghosts, like living people. It really is an extremely lonely and torturing existence for ghosts.</p>
              <p>If you ever encounter a ghost seeking your attention, don't be afraid of them, try to help them if you know how or get people who can, to guide them to the Light, if possible. It will bring you good karma in return for your compassionate deed, even if you are not the one finally carrying out the work.</p>

              <p>I would recommend that you find out from people who have <strong>personally experienced</strong> having an encounter with a <strong>real ghost</strong> (not just imagination or whatever) and then chanted on the spot, rather than depend on hearsay. :)</p>
              <p>It is not uncommon for people (with great fear of ghosts) to think that they have encountered a ghost, when actually, there really is no ghost anywhere around. Although it's true that we can feel coldness when a ghost is around, but seriously, when a person is very scared, he/she can also feel coldness to the extent of shivering, and the hair on the back of neck standing up, even though the cause is not due to a ghost's presence, but own fears.</p>
              <p>For such cases which really only involve imagination and inner fears, whatever form of remedy that he uses will be deemed as effective, since it's purely to help him regain his sense of security.</p>
