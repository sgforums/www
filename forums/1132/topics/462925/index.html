              <p>As 21.12.12 is fast approaching, I thought it would be a good time to share about Reality Timelines, as everyone will be able to change their reality if they wish to. Reality does not actually flow in a linear manner. There are multiple parallel Reality Timelines, which people can shift into every moment of their lives. It's like driving on a road with many lanes, with each lane branching out into different destinations and seeing different scenery along the way. At certain junctions on the timelines, there are intersections with multidimensional events/situations, which is when events that totally defy human logic and science happen.</p>
              <p>Unlike driving a car, we change the Reality Timeline we're on, not by using a steering wheel, but by our personal choice of how we live our current Now moment in time. However, the challenge of navigating Reality Timelines is that we need to synchronize our mind and heart to get onto the timeline that we truly want. It is something that many people struggle with, lifetime after lifetime, as they tend to get onto the timeline that is the opposite of what they truly wanted, because their minds and hearts are not in sync.</p>
              <p>After 21.12.12, all of us will be able to shift our realities much more easily. Hope you can understand my sharing here, so that you can live the life that you really desire. :)</p>

              <p>Just a sharing,</p>
              <p>Actually the universe (and consciousness) is holographic. Everything is simultaneously occuring. There is no distance, time, location. Beings experience events based on conditions that they are 'attracted/attached' to.</p>
              <p>Under normal circumstance, Beings' focus are binded to their thoughts. The thoughts form their solid-looking physical reality. However, what appear to be solid is not solid at all. It is a mere optical illusion. In actuality, everything is occurring in a timeless manner. </p>
              <p>To see the timeless, holographic reality, the 'agents/conditions' that create this illusion have to be disconstructed. The conditions that create the illusion of physical solid reality includes our mental pre-assumptions (subject-object division aka duality) and the sense of a self.</p>
              <p>For example, our mind can understand that space is infinite and without an end. However, our individual personhood does not seem to be able to see onto infinity. One of the spell that create this limited condition is the attachment of the focus onto thoughts about the past and future (imagination).... and the sense of an individual self. When awareness is aligned into the direct Present moment (Now), no thinking about past and future... the sense of a self can momentarily cease and awareness will have an awakening that it has never experienced before. Awareness will understand its all-pervading presence... just like space has no border.</p>
