              <p>Just about 3 weeks ago, my soon to be 67 years old dad was hospitalised 
              and was diagnosed with a minor stroke. That made him a diabetic with 
              stroke now. He had been hospitalized years ago due to his diabetes were 
              almost out of control. <br> <br> However, this time around, me and family had encounter several strange 
              happenings to us since my dad was away in hospital. Its the first time 
              we had such encounters. <br> First, my sister and mum had smell the perfume of my dad at home when in
               fact he wasnt there. Few days later, while at home, i heard someone 
              sneezing outside my house which sounds like my dad. Next was, the rice 
              in the cooker, which never has turn bad despite being kept for more than
               a day, really turn bad that evening when my mom had it cooked in the 
              morning. And my mum cooked the rice everyday, same time, but never 
              before this happens. In malay culture, they believed that when a rice turn 
              bad suddenly during a time when a family member is badly sick, it means 
              that that person's death is imminent. Im not too sure if that is true or
               not. And just in the wee hours of this morning, my sister saw a red 
              grasshopper in the kitchen sink. We had never seen grasshoppers in our 
              home and I know grasshoppers in the house would mean something. My mum 
              claimed that she seen some changes in my dad's face like deepening of 
              cheek bones and his nose has crooked. However, i dont see that when i 
              visited my dad.<br> <br> The doc said his stroke is stabilized now except that his blood pressure
               drops when he stands, thus making him too dizzy to walk on his own. <br> <br> All Im wondering if these strange weird things has something to do with 
              my dad being sick. I sometimes asked myself and my family if we are just
               over reacting.</p>
