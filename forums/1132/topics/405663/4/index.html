              <p><br>The current Earth Realm (3rd dimension) is just a 'training ground' for souls; this place was never meant to be our permanent ground/home. Unfortunately, for people 'trapped' in the cycles, this place feels like where they belong, permanently.</p>
              <p>For those who have learnt what they need to learn, will mean they are ready to help others still in their cycles. Most of the time, they'll choose to stay in the Spiritual Realm to be Spiritual Guides of others still yet to complete their cycles (I briefly talked about this in my other posting: <a href="/forums/1132/topics/406094">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1132/topics/406094</a>).</p>
              <p>In <strong>extremely </strong>rare cases, souls can choose to return to Earth Realm again, as a reincarnated physical being. Reason for returning as a physical being is needed sometimes, because not enough people on Earth believe that there's a Spiritual Realm, not enough people on Earth believe that there are far more beings in the Spiritual Realm than the gods that people read about, not enough people on Earth believe people don't really disappear into ashes and thin air after dying, not enough people on Earth understand that Life on Earth has just been an 'illusion', and most important of all, not enough people on Earth understand that this 'illusion' is finally going to be unveiled soon...</p>
              <p>Currently, though the percentage in the entire world population is still extremely minute, there're many of such beings (mostly awakened Indigo Adults) all around the world now, who chose to return to help, because of an urgent need, in preparation for the coming years.</p>
              <p>But those who return need to have a certain level of soul level and spiritual experience, else they might end up being affected by the 'illusion' and negativity on Earth and end up being 'trapped' here again. Imagine a soul who actually has very positive karma, comes back to Earth, instead of helping others, somehow went to kill someone, for whatever reasons. He/she will end up having to rejoin the reincarnation cycle to re-learn again. </p>

              <p><br>Viewing Life <strong>very strictly </strong>in terms of Eastern/Western/African/European/Chinese/Malay/Indian/etc and from different religious perspectives is one of the barriers/obstacles people need to overcome to look beyond the 'illusion' of Life on Earth. It's fine to practise/see from one's preferred angle, but if we choose to reject all other angles, without trying to understand those other angles as well, one will not be able to see through the illusion and get the big picture.</p>
              <p>A person typically will not always reincarnate back in the same geographical location, every single lifetime. In this lifetime you're here now in S'pore. Next lifetime, you could very well be born as a rich female in England, a poor male in Brazil, or an illiterate African tribal chief in some jungle tribe, you never know. So, if this lifetime, you believe very strongly in Oriental perspectives, and believe that to be the only truth, in your next lifetime, when you've spiritually matured even more, will you still think that only Oriental practices are right?</p>
              <p>Just to share, very advanced souls often have in-depth experiences from most of the mainstream religions, as well as non-mainstream forms of spirituality (eg. Mayan, Native American Indian, Atlantean, etc) all around the world, in all their lifetimes, and gained the skills and knowledge from <strong>all </strong>of them.</p>
              <p>Actually, <strong>core</strong> essenses of the mainstream and non-mainstream religions/faiths from both Eastern and Western worlds are the same, except that they're told from different angles, and they each hold important pieces of the big jigsaw puzzle of Life. Once you can get those pieces together, you'll be able to see the big picture; see the individual pieces on their own, and they will not be able to tell you all that you need to know.</p>
              <p>If it's so easy to 'graduate' by simply learning from just 1 angle, why do all of us need countless lifetimes to complete our reincarnation cycles? :)</p>

              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) No, sunlight cannot ward off ghosts. Ghosts can be around, day or night, in any location. The reason why we usually see ghosts at night, is because they are more easily visible under low levels of light. Even at night, it's easier to see them using candle light, than under our electric fluorescent light.</p>
              <p>And it's easier to see them at corners or doorways, away from direct light, not because they are scared of light, but it's easier for our eyes to see. It's really not easy to see them, even for people with the ability to do it, as we're not of the same density as the lost souls (ghosts). It's because of ghosts' density, that enables them to walk through solid walls and objects, and we can't. And most of the time, you can just catch a few seconds of them, so people often think they're imagining things. </p>
              <p>Though ghosts can sometimes appear in clearer and more visible forms, usually, they just appear as shadowy silhouettes of their last physical life. In such forms, you can only see their outlines, but cannot see their faces or other details, but somehow you'll be able to tell if they are male/female or estimate their age (eg. old woman or young lady). Due to the density of our air, the easiest time to see them is during 1am-5am, even though they are there 24/7. :) </p>
              <p>2) I will not be able to answer this question fully here, as the "Universal Laws" are very comprehensive and complex. I have to admit I don't know their full scope (I'm not the Ultimate Consciousness! hehe.), but I can share the major ones that affect Life on Earth. Could you elaborate specifically which aspects are you referring to?</p>
              <p>But I can share an important point here: Earth is governed by <em>almost complete </em>freewill, unlike other worlds/planets. It applies to living humans, ghosts, ETs, spirits, etc, as long as they are operating on Earth. Because of this, it has brought both joy and pain to people. Many people do not know how to control/manage so much freedom of choice in Life, and so end up walking negative paths or choosing negative choices, and end up being stuck here.</p>
              <p>One reason why ghosts can stay here in Earth Realm for very long periods of time, eg. for many centuries, is because of this freewill they're given. Along the way, if living humans don't help them move on to the Light (Spiritual Realm), the Spiritual Guides of these ghosts will occasionally drop by to persuade them to leave Earth Realm. However, there is no Time in Spiritual Realm, so "occasionally" in Spiritual Realm terms can mean decades or hundreds of years in Earth terms. :)</p>
              <p>Ghosts do not have a stable consciousness, unlike spirits who have already returned to the Light and came back to visit. If the ghosts choose to use their freewill to stay here, it will cause problems for their own soul lives, as well as for living beings they come in contact with. But the ghosts will not think 'rationally' in logical sense. So, in order to help them move on, living humans need to use their freewill to choose to help them. Spiritual Realm will very rarely interfere, without being asked to.  </p>

              <p><br>Yes, the scope is very wide, as it covers the truth about Life and Earth. Life on Earth is not only about Birth, Life and Death, but of course, that's the basic foundation that everyone needs to understand first. All the broad aspects are all inter-linked, though they may not seem to be related at first. As all the aspects shared are meant to help people of different soul levels and evolvement, the fundamentals need to be understood first before the other aspects will make sense.</p>
              <p>Understanding the true process of Life/Death will answer most people's common questions about ghosts and spirits. If people can understand the more complex aspects that I've shared, they'll understand why it'll be much easier for everyone to see ghosts and spirits all around us in the coming years...</p>
              <p>Understanding what are the common life lessons that people need to learn, and various forms of negativity that people struggle with, will answer why people's lives are the way they are now.</p>
              <p>Just to share one simple example: many parent/young-child relationships are currently facing a lot of tension and friction, because the children (as young as 8-12 yrs old) are actually much older souls and more spiritually evolved than their parents. But these parents may not understand or believe in reincarnation, so are frustrated that their young children seem so stubborn, and keep insisting on their way. [I'm not referring to childish behaviour like insisting on buying sweets or toys here! haha....] If these parents continue to be ignorant about the process of Life, and choose to use negative approaches to discipline and control their young children, they could in fact be failing their own life lessons, delaying their 'graduation' from Earth.</p>
              <p>It takes time and great effort to gather all the key pieces of Life, but once you have those pieces in front of you, and start piecing them together, you'll be able to see much further and clearer than people around you. :)</p>

              <p><br>When people are connected with their soul/spirit (or to the Source within them) deep within themselves, everyone will know the best way to lead their lives, to ensure that they walk the right path to complete their soul learning journey, and complete their reincarnation cycles.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, most people are totally disconnected with their soul/spirit and Source, and function purely with their physical minds and Self Ego, and/or turn to external parties to tell them how to live their lives, and what/how to think. This is where all the problems come, as many of these "external parties" are not spiritually advanced enough to lead the 'right way'. Spiritual advancement in the Universe is not based on self-proclaimed or man-created Earthly titles or hierachies of authority and power.</p>
              <p>A person holding the title of "Super Grandmaster Supreme Spiritual Leader of the Great Wide Universe" in some religious/spiritual group, who leads thousands of followers, may only be a young soul in the Universe, who just experienced a couple of Earth lifetimes, and is eternity away from completing his reincarnation cycles.</p>
              <p>But of course, in the Universe, there's no real "right way" or "wrong way". All ways are there for people to choose and walk. It's all about cause and effect, and freewill (in the case of Earth). Choose your own path, and go through the resulting consequences. That's why some people can finish their lessons earlier, some people take a longer time to finish, some get stuck at the some spot, some get lost along the way, some go backwards, etc. It's all about choices. In a way, no one is right or wrong. It's more about what they really want in Life, and learn from their choices. :)</p>

              <p>I've already described in my earlier posting. You may want to ask TS of this thread if he's willing to let you visit and take a look. hehe... Not everyone is able to see all the time, even if the ghost is standing right in front of you. Alternatively, you may like to walk around nearby places of worship at night, as the energy at such places attracts lost souls (ghosts).</p>

              <p><br>It's ok if you feel that way. You feel that lost souls (ghosts) are afraid of places of worship? Or you've seen ghosts fleeing from places of worship? :)</p>
              <p>What is, and what we think it should be, are 2 very different sides. Often people choose to believe what they want to, not what really is.</p>
              <p>Media and fictional books' portrayal of ghosts are often over dramatic and incorrect, for the sake of instilling fear in people, and earning more money. After all, if people learn the truth about ghosts, and are not scared of ghosts, how can the media industry continue to churn big bucks? :)</p>
              <p>Anyway, for the benefit of other forumers, lost souls (ghosts) feed on positive energy, to sustain themselves, and so are attracted to places of worship. As I've explained in earlier posts, though some ghosts may be of very negative nature, majority of them are simply souls of deceased who 'got lost' in the Universe, and got 'stuck' in our Earth Realm, instead of returning to the Light (Spiritual Realm) properly.</p>
              <p>Hence, they need our help, and compassion, not fear. Anyone can become a lost soul (ghost) upon death, under certain circumstances during the final moments, and whether the person has a religion, what religion, or is a free-thinker, makes absolutely no difference.</p>
              <p>Ghosts have no idea they are dead, or refuse to believe they are dead, so very often seek to be around people, to 'feel alive'.</p>
