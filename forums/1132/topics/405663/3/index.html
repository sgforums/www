              <p><br> I respect your passion for your field of study or practice. But I
              feel I need to share something here for forumers, whether
              people wish to believe, it's everyone's choice.</p>
              <p>There's more than 1 "exit point" in everyone's life. People who
              do future readings or calculations often can see the most probable
              path. In the past, future readings/calculations can be quite
              "stable", ie. more easily "predicted" (actually, it's seen) when
              done by experienced psychics. But in the coming years, people's
              future paths can make <strong>very huge</strong> change in
              directions suddenly, depending on their choices in life, due to
              what's coming ahead. A future reading or calculation made 6 months
              back, may no longer be applicable now. It's that dynamic now.</p>
              <p>However, one thing is certain, a person whose life has already
              been planned to end prematurely (ie. not by natural old age) will
              eventually still leave this world prematurely, even if he chose to
              avoid the earlier planned "Exit points". The only difference is the
              actual date will change. Personally, I don't encourage
              people to fear death, and live their lives planning for it or
              trying to avoid it. It's far more meaningful to live for the
              moment, and be the best person one can be now. </p>
              <p>Just my sharing. :)</p>

              <p><br>I have no wish to offend anyone's beliefs, and digress too far from TS' topic, so I shall just limit my sharing to a bare minimum here. How all our lives are planned and run, is really far more complex. We have our free-will to determine our lives, to a great extent, though certain major points need to go as planned. People tend to think it's prediction of their future, but in reality, in higher dimensions, there's no Time, so effectively, Past/Present/Future all happen at the same moment, so it's possible for certain people to cross dimensions to see the future and past-lives. It's not easy to believe and understand this, as we're all so used to Time in our 3rd dimension. :)</p>
              <p>Though it's true that it can be quite accurate for some people's lives to be 'predicted' using their birth numbers previously, it's simply because these people stick purely to their lifeplan, subconsciously. That's why trained people can 'calculate' or 'predict' some people's lives, to a certain extent in the past.</p>

In a couple of years, many people's lives could already be totally different from now, hopefully for the better, depending on their choices along the way. :)</p>
              <p>Anyway, back to TS' topic: it's considered a good deed and will bring good karma to people who want to help lost souls leave this Earth realm peacefully, and not let them get stuck here eternally, where they have a very sad and pitiful existence, as this is not where they belong. </p>

              <p>"Healing" in the field of energy work refers anything to do with
              energy (in one's body, environment or Universe), not just physical
              body healing. I use crystals for my energy work, so I appreciate
              their uses, but still need to share many misconceptions about them.
              :)</p>
              <p>I shared about helping lost souls move on, to help dispel the
              fear that many people have of them. If people can understand our
              world better, there'll be so much less fear. You may disagree,
              but having a crystal in the home may only have a
              temporary effect, because if the lost soul has been living in
              the home (it's usu. the area) for decades
              or hundreds of years, due to past event, they will
              still return.</p>
              <p>And if the lost soul is drawn to a person for certain reasons,
              how effective can a crystal be, 24/7, forever in this
              lifetime? A lost soul is always awake, does not need to sleep,
              and will forever be around, until they are led to move on to the
              Light. A person at his weakest (eg. sick, stressed or
              depressed) will be most vulnerable to the draining effects of a
              lost soul, and no crystal will be strong enough to protect him/her.
              Ideally, a person is able to develop his true spiritual strength
              (not based on false promises or fake sense of security) to be
              strong enough to overcome negative energy.</p>
              <p>Dealing with lost souls is not the same as getting a mosquito
              repellant to get rid of mosquitoes! hehe... Lost souls have
              consciousness. They may not know they're dead, but they can think
              and behave as if they're alive, and they have spiritual abilities
              that they didn't have when they were alive. People who can
              see/feel/communicate with them will understand what I'm trying to
              explain.</p>
              <p>As for crystals, many of the crystal shops in Singapore are pure
              rip-offs, and are not even selling genuine crystals! More for
              decorative use than anything else, but shopowners always claim they
              have "magical properties". That was my caution to forumers.</p>

              <p>That's not true, even aura photography shown that crystals' aura are huge and strong, even if crystal is small size.The good thing about crystal is that they remain strong.</p>
              <p>Ideally, how many persons are able to develop "true spiritual strength" to ward off ghosts? In materialistic &amp; stressful society like singapore, how many people are able to cultivate fully spiritual?</p>
              <p>For most people who don't, crystals are the best objects to ward off ghosts.</p>
              <p>It is unkind of you to make such an unfair &amp; sweeping statements that most crystal shops are rip-offs? If you had an unpleasant personal experience, do take it up with the shop directly.</p>
              <p>Generally speaking, Kinokuniya bookshop @ Ngee Ann sells alot of genuine &amp; natural crystals at affordable prices - $5 to $10+, $20+ or $30+. Most of their crystals are in natural form geode or group cluster or single cluster. Even most crystals shops, I can name quite a number of them, sells genuine &amp; natural crystals as they are affordable items. $20-30+ I can get a nice one.</p>

              <p>That's not true, even aura photography shown that crystals' aura are huge and strong, even if crystal is small size.The good thing about crystal is that they remain strong.</p>
              <p>Ideally, how many persons are able to develop "true spiritual strength" to ward off ghosts? In materialistic &amp; stressful society like singapore, how many people are able to cultivate fully spiritual?</p>
              <p>For most people who don't, crystals are the best objects to ward off ghosts.</p>
              <p>It is unkind of you to make such an unfair &amp; sweeping statements that most crystal shops are rip-offs? If you had an unpleasant personal experience, do take it up with the shop directly.</p>
              <p>Generally speaking, Kinokuniya bookshop @ Ngee Ann sells alot of genuine &amp; natural crystals at affordable prices - $5 to $10+, $20+ or $30+. Most of their crystals are in natural form geode or group cluster or single cluster. Even most crystals shops, I can name quite a number of them, sells genuine &amp; natural crystals as they are affordable items. $20-30+ I can get a nice one.</p>

              <p>Besides crystals, all living things have aura (energy field) around them. People can find out their own auras by taking Kirlian/aura photos of themselves. Just to help people understand a bit more about auras, my aura is Indigo (purple end of the spectrum) and has wide coverage, and I can walk right in front of a lost soul within arm's length, and the lost soul will still remain there, until I do whatever is necessary to help them move on to the Light. Auras are just visible energy fields. Period. You're right that purple auras indicate spiritually strong energy, and certain genuine crystals have purple auras. But it's what you do with the energy that makes the difference. :)</p>
              <p>Please don't misunderstand my purpose of sharing, as I'm just wish people to understand what they're getting for their money. Genuine crystals help to improve the environment definitely, as in improving energy in a room, but when it comes to dealing with lost souls, well, I've already explained in my earlier posts.</p>
              <p>Just for anyone who truly needs to and die-die-must-verify, with actual visible proof: find a person who can see lost-souls, get a genuine crystal, do whatever you want with the crystal (wave it around, spin it, sing song with it, play Guitar Hero with it, operate it like a lightsabre, stab the lost soul, etc) to try and get rid of the lost souls, and see what happens. Whatever you do, they will return. :) Just be very careful when you're dealing with a revengeful lost soul, you don't wish to get yourself in bigger problems that you can't get out of.</p>

              <p>Think we're drifting too far from TS' topic. But just a very brief sharing here (which definitely won't be enough to answer all your points here):</p>
              <p>everyone's lifeplan is like a HUGE tree chart (closest thing to visualise in our world). there are so many possibilities at every step of the way. Everything you do at every moment of your life, there are more options to choose from. Though we may think that we're living in a random world, those options for our entire life have already been mapped out even before we started this lifetime.</p>
              <p>And everyone actually knows the major (not all) milestones in their current lifetime, prior to reincarnation, when we were back in the Spiritual Realm. But once we get born, most people (not all) lose all spiritual memories, by intentional amnesia set on us, so that we can choose our life journey through freewill. If the intentional amnesia wasn't set on us, everyone will be living robotic lives, as they will know exactly which path to take or avoid.</p>
              <p>So, even though we're living each moment of our own choice, the options open to us are known to people who have the spiritual abilities to know (so that they can help people and not abuse that gift), as well as to Higher Beings.</p>
              <p>For majority of people in this world now, they would still have many outstanding life lessons to learn, and still have a long way to go before completing their reincarnation cycles. So, their lifeplans often revolve around having to learn and complete certain life lessons, eg. learn to be more compassionate, learn to deal with aggression, etc, as well as fulfilling karmic contracts. However, for other aspects of their life, they can do whatever they want, as per their freewill.</p>
              <p>Those life lessons cannot be avoided, no matter how they choose to lead their lives, because that's the <strong>very </strong>purpose of this lifetime for them. The Universe and their Spiritual Guides will <strong>ensure</strong> that they have to go through those lessons in this lifetime. If people avoid a certain situation, other situations will happen, so that people have to go through those lessons. For worst case scenarios, where people simply choose to avoid their life lessons throughout this entire lifetime, or they fail to learn from the lesson, they will have to repeat it in another lifetime, effectively wasting this lifetime. This happens very very very very often, which is why some people call it "endless cycles of suffering".</p>
              <p>For 'younger' souls, often, it's usually just 1 major life lesson per lifetime, so life won't be that difficult for them. But as souls mature, they may need to learn more than 1 life lesson per lifetime, so it gets more challenging.</p>
              <p>Generally, as long as people can be as positive as possible, <strong>and </strong>at the same time, get rid of their own negativity, and treat others (people, animals, Nature, Universe) positively, they should be able to get through their life lessons. Unfortunately, not everyone is willing to do this, or able to do this, consciously or subconsciously, and so the cycle continues...</p>

              <p>"everyone's lifeplan is like a HUGE tree chart (closest thing to visualise in our world). there are so many possibilities at every step of the way. Everything you do at every moment of your life, there are more options to choose from. Though we may think that we're living in a random world, <strong>those options for our entire life have already been mapped out even before we started this lifetime</strong>."</p>
              <p>to reiterate my stand that karma plays a huge part in life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p><br>As explained in my previous posting, our life plan is determined by the life lessons that we need to learn as well as karmic contracts that need to be fulfilled. Of course, karma is extremely important, especially for people who have ALOT of outstanding negative balance, but it's not the only factor that determines our lifeplan. :)</p>
              <p>Hard to explain fully here, but I'll give a quick one: in ideal cases, people will learn increasingly more advanced life lessons with each lifetime, increase their karma balance (ie. gain positive karma, with no negative karma), become more enlightened and progress in their spiritual existence, till they 'graduate' and no longer need to reincarnate.</p>
              <p>But unfortunately, for most people, instead of becoming more enlightened in each lifetime, they end up chalking up more negative karma in each lifetime, without clearing their already large negative karma balance, because they were unable to manage their negativity, resulting in them having to clear negative karma as well as learn their life lessons in subsequent lifetimes. It really results in their subsequent lives becoming more and more difficult, due to their own actions, unless they understand this and start to do what they're required to do.</p>
              <p>It's a very messy situation for many people, seriously, if only they understand what's happening, which they will when they return to the Spiritual Realm for "Debrief". Sounds funny, but it's part of the process of Life. :) People who have gone through Spiritual Regression can actually remember themselves during the "Debrief" back in the Spiritual Realm, and often regretting the many things that they failed to do, or did wrongly in their last life. "Debrief" and "Reflection" are 2 very different steps that will happen when people return to the Spiritual Realm. "Reflection" is the one where people can either feel they're in heaven or hell, depending on their past deeds and behaviour.</p>

              <p><br>I know due to different religious beliefs, this is hard to accept. But I've shared what I need to, and it'll be very choppy in the coming years. No need to wait that long, especially for people with ALOT of negative karma balance. It's up to people's choice to reject it, or do something about their lives now.</p>
              <p>"Pre-determined" is a very broad term. I'll say: some parts in our life plan are non-negotiable, but we have freewill to change the course of our lives for the other parts that we're allowed to. But I urge everyone to take an active role in creating as positive a life journey for yourselves, as possible. For people who have taken the same 'wrong path' several times in past lives, somehow have a subconscious 'habit' of following that same 'wrong path' again in subsequent lives. So they fall into an "infinite loop". It can be broken only with very strong will and determination to choose the right path.</p>

              <p>People with ALOT of negative karma balance will generally be so 'swarmed' in their lives because they have a lot of karma to clear. For them, karma clearing effectively runs their life, as they're so busy 'repaying debts' all their lives to have energy to learn new life lessons that will help them grow and mature as souls.</p>
              <p>But for people without little or no negative karma to clear, they can then focus their lifetime on the actual objective of their lifeplan, ie. to learn the planned life lesson(s), and progress.</p>
              <p>As for completing reincarnation cycles, everyone can do it, eventually, if they are determined enough, every lifetime. Unfortunately, there's tremendous 'negative programming' in our world that that conditioned people to think that they are unworthy and full of sins, and that life is all about suffering. And people are conditioned to suppress their true spiritual growth, so much that most people don't even know they have spiritual abilities within themselves, which can be put to good use, for helping others. That will speed up their spiritual growth a lot.</p>
              <p>By overcoming that mental block, <strong>anyone</strong> will be able to end their reincarnation cycles. It can be done, as long as people believe in themselves and are willing to make the determined effort to be get rid of negativity in themselves and their lives. And they don't have to be monks/priests/nuns etc to do that. :)</p>

              <p>It's up to you to believe or not, but you're communicating with one now, and I'm just an unknown person in this world now. Many non-famous people like me have completed our cycles eons ago and are back here now to help others complete their cycles asap, and to help people get back on track, among other things we need to do. If you feel the need to verify what I've just shared, with any other <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>genuine</strong> </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and trusted</span> (not quacks, con-artists, psychic-wannabes or half-past-six-psychics) </strong>psychics/channelers anywhere in the world, feel free to do so. </p>
              <p>As for why I'm back here now, though I've completed my cycles long ago, you need to visit my website to understand the reason, with an open mind. I cannot stress enough that the Universe is much more complex than what most people can possibly imagine, or read about in ancient or religious texts. :)</p>
              <p>Why do you need real examples? Why can't you and everyone else have more faith and belief in yourselves? :)</p>
              <p>Try to understand the illusion of Earth with an open mind and heart, and look beyond that illusion, and you can do many things that you never thought possible in your life. When you can look beyond that illusion, you'll then be able to see the truth in our world. Most people are trapped by that illusion and "negative programming", and so remain stuck in the endless cycles.</p>
