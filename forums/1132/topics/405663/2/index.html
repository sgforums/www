              <p>Everyone has a lifeplan. If it's not time yet to die, the person will somehow still survive, or be saved somehow. Though he/she may end up paralyzed for life or suffer very serious injuries, his/her life will still be intact, as there are still very important things that they have not yet done in this life. Often, the thing to do could be related to another person.</p>
              <p>However, if someone's time is up, no matter what precautions he/she takes, they can still leave this realm, through the strangest of circumstances. But at the end of the day, if people understand what the purpose of Life and Death is, they will not be afraid at all. :)</p>

              <p>It's good that you're not afraid of seeing the lost souls/spirits/ghosts.</p>
              <p>However, it's not a good thing to continue staying with them in your home. They will feed on your positive energy, which they need it to sustain themselves, as they are lost in this Earth realm where they no longer belong to. That's one reason why they are often found in or near places of worship.</p>
              <p>It'll have negative effects on the occupants of the home, when their positive energy keeps getting drained, and the people do not know how to recharge or 'grow' it in themselves. Real life is not like in the movies, where ghosts go around hunting and killing people, but still, it's strongly advised that you help them (or engage people who know how) move on to the Light, to the Spiritual Realm where they should go to, as it's a noble thing to do. Often, these lost souls are not even aware they are dead, so it's a very sad way of existence.</p>
              <p>The other reason is that increasing, more children being born currently and in the future will be Indigo Children, who are extremely sensitive to energy (positive or negative). They will <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span></strong> dislike staying and living in the presence of strong negative energy, such as that coming from the lost souls.</p>

              <p><br>Of course, we should not dismiss that it's pure imagination. But people who can see/feel non-physical entities will know it themselves, especially if they've done so often enough.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a super tiny place in the world, with very short history, so chances of knowing enough people with the ability to see/feel non-physical entities and encountering them are extremely low, so it's very easy to dismiss such incidents as pure imagination. But venture to places in other parts of the world, to specific locations which have very long history of mass deaths, especially wars and massacres, and it'll be much easier to encounter lost souls still hanging around, thinking they're still alive, as their deaths were too sudden and traumatic for them to accept and believe they're actually dead.</p>
              <p>As a forumer replied in this post, what you cannot see/feel does not mean others cannot see/feel as well, and what you cannot see/feel does not mean something does not exist or happen. :)</p>

              <p>Sorry to say, but wearing/displaying crystals alone cannot help lost souls move on to the Light, though it's true that genuine crystals have spiritual uses, but they're good mostly for healing purposes, when used by experienced practitioners.

              <p>Beware of marketing/sales ploys that attempt to sell all sorts of "magical items". If it's some consolation, lost souls are not found in everyone's home. So if displaying a large pretty purple crystal gives a sense of security to the family members, there's no harm done, except to the buyer's wallet. :) </p>

              <p>Though Creator and Higher Beings have the power to help lost souls move on to the Light, we humans affected by them have to be ones to initiate and request to help the lost souls. Because, often we humans were the ones who attracted them, or caused the events which resulted in the lost souls. This is not easy to explain in full here, but that's how Earth is being governed, with regards to lost souls. :)</p>

              <p><br>We need to be benevolent towards lost souls, as they are stuck here due to reasons that prevent them from leaving Earth realm in peace after death, eg. traumatic death, extreme love or extreme hatred for people who are still alive. In cases of extreme hatred, it's possible for the lost souls to cause intentional harm to people, out of revenge. This is the part where movies and stories like to exaggerate on.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anyone</span> </strong>can become a lost soul upon death, under certain situations. Having a religion (no matter what religion it is) or not makes no difference. Many people (of various faiths) like to think that their respective religion assures their good after-life, to feel better. But the truth is: How people lead their lives is what makes the difference in their after-life. :)</p>

              <p><br>I respect your passion for your field of study or practice. But I feel I need to share something here for forumers, whether people wish to believe, it's everyone's choice.</p>
              <p>There's more than 1 "exit point" in everyone's life. People who do future readings or calculations often can see the most probable path. In the past, future readings/calculations can be quite "stable", ie. more easily "predicted" (actually, it's seen) when done by experienced psychics. But in the coming years, people's future paths can make <strong>very huge </strong>change in directions suddenly, depending on their choices in life, due to what's coming ahead. A future reading or calculation made 6 months back, may no longer be applicable now. It's that dynamic now.</p>
              <p>However, one thing is certain, a person whose life has already been planned to end prematurely (ie. not by natural old age) will eventually still leave this world prematurely, even if he chose to avoid the earlier planned "Exit points". The only difference is the actual date will change. Personally, I don't encourage people to fear death, and live their lives planning for it or trying to avoid it. It's far more meaningful to live for the moment, and be the best person one can be now. </p>

              <p>"Healing" in the field of energy work refers anything to do with energy (in one's body, environment or Universe), not just physical body healing. I use crystals for my energy work, so I appreciate their uses, but still need to share many misconceptions about them. :)</p>
              <p>I shared about helping lost souls move on, to help dispel the fear that many people have of them. If people can understand our world better, there'll be so much less fear. You may disagree, but having a crystal in the home may only have a temporary effect, because if the lost soul has been living in the home (it's usu. the area) for decades or hundreds of years, due to past event, they will still return.</p>
              <p>And if the lost soul is drawn to a person for certain reasons, how effective can a crystal be, 24/7, forever in this lifetime? A lost soul is always awake, does not need to sleep, and will forever be around, until they are led to move on to the Light. A person at his weakest (eg. sick, stressed or depressed) will be most vulnerable to the draining effects of a lost soul, and no crystal will be strong enough to protect him/her. Ideally, a person is able to develop his true spiritual strength (not based on false promises or fake sense of security) to be strong enough to overcome negative energy.</p>
              <p>Dealing with lost souls is not the same as getting a mosquito repellant to get rid of mosquitoes! hehe... Lost souls have consciousness. They may not know they're dead, but they can think and behave as if they're alive, and they have spiritual abilities that they didn't have when they were alive. People who can see/feel/communicate with them will understand what I'm trying to explain.</p>
              <p>As for crystals, many of the crystal shops in Singapore are pure rip-offs, and are not even selling genuine crystals! More for decorative use than anything else, but shopowners always claim they have "magical properties". That was my caution to forumers.</p>
