              <p>A hotel at Scotts Road offered STOMPer Ms Chen a truly unique stay, not for its exemplary service, but for the spooky noises she heard all night. Ms Chen described the night in her 13th floor suite as a terrifying experience.<br><br>She tells us how, as night fell, she heard furniture being moved about in the unit above hers, as well as sounds of drilling and pounding. Ms Chen’s appeals to the Hotel Royal's front desk were met with evasive answers.<br><br>She eventually found out that the room above hers was occupied by a sleeping man - so who made those noises? Later, as she stood outside her own empty room after vacating it, she heard the sound of furniture moving within.<br><br>The spooky experience led her to dub the hotel 'Hotel Royal-fornia', after the famous song 'Hotel California' by the Eagles, which supposedly describes a haunted hotel.<br><br>She writes in an email:<br><br>My recent stay at a 13th floor hotel suite at Hotel Royal, Scotts Road, was a terrifying experience.<br><br>"At first my foreign friend and I loved the very oriental-themed furnishing that was accorded the suite. As night drew near, we heard sounds of furniture scraping/moving around in the unit above us. This went on till about 2 am.<br><br>"We slept thereafter, till about 5-6 am, when we were awoken by pounding and drilling noises, which seemingly, came from the unit above again. <br><br>"A couple of calls to the hotel front desk did not help matters. When we spoke to the duty manager the following night, they tried to lie and say that the pounding noise came from the disco on the 16th floor. <br><br>"Ludicrous - if the noise from the disco could be heard 3 floors down, why did the guests from the 14th and 15th floors not lodge complaints? Moreover, the disco isn't even open on weekday nights! <br><br>"The manageress still tried to allocate us a single bedroom in place of our suite- yet refusing to reduce the price! Then she confessed that they would investigate the source of the noise, and hoped that it was made by 'someone' and not 'something'. Wonderful service and problem-handling skills, wouldn't you say? <br><br>"Having vacated the 13th floor suite, my foreign friend and I headed to the unit on the 14th floor to investigate on our own. <br><br>"We stood outside the room and all we heard was the loud snoring of a man. <br><br>"We then went back to the 13th floor hotel room - which by then was empty because we moved out - and standing outside, we heard the sound of furniture moving within! This had me spooked for days."<br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>interesting! they should've just knocked on the doors of occupants on 14th and 15th floor just to be sure.<br><br>anybody else got spooky hotel tales?</p>

              <div id="post_message_457624" class="vb_postbit">My colleague from Taiwan told me this when she stayed in Meritus Mandarin along Orchard Road.<br><br>She was alone in her room. After partying, she went back to her hotel room around 2+am. She happily went to enjoy her bath in the bathtub. So good that she fell asleep inside it. All of a sudden, she was being carried up and dumped onto the floor by "something" although there wasn't anybody there. She quickly get dressed and started to pray. <br><br>The next moment she went into the room, there was a text message running across the TV saying "Hello XYZ (her name)" to her. That time her TV was not even switched on!! She nearly fainted. She couldn't switch to other channels. She couldn't handle it and decided to check out of the hotel room instantly at the middle of the night and camp at the lobby until morning.</div>

              <p><br>When I went holiday, before going in the hotel room, should knock knock the door, go in and say "sorry bro and sis, we are for holiday, only stay for few nights, plse dont distrub us. Thank you so much bro and sis."</p>

              <p>people like you will get it one day. may be now your luck is good but one's luck is always up and down. when one's luck is down and went to places which are haunted, things will happen regardless of your religion. next time, when you see people who don't believe in ghosts but shift hotel room in the middle of the night, you know what happen ah.</p>
