              <p>Ever since I've shared that it's my life purpose to help people understand about and prepare for Ascension, I've received numerous queries. I've been guided to touch upon one particular aspect in this posting that is key to Ascension, ie. "Letting Go". There is already a thread on Ascension, so please refer to it, if you like to know other info.</p>
              <p>Basically, Ascension is a personal experience, when people are finally ready to leave this 3rd dimensional Earth realm and move on to higher dimensions for good. Meaning, people no longer need to continue their endless cycles of reincarnation on Earth.</p>
              <p>The day of Ascension from a 3rd dimensional world is different for every person. It can happen in this lifetime, or future lifetimes, depending on each person's "soul readiness". It is not a single day event, though it's very likely that there would be groups of people Ascending together in separate occasions in this lifetime, because of the uniqueness of this lifetime.</p>
              <p>There are various aspects in one's Life, Mind, Heart and Body to prepare for before they can be ready to Ascend. For the purpose of this posting, I shall just highlight the point of "Letting Go" of attachments. The term "Letting Go" is often floated around very often, but it takes really great determination and personal effort to really Let Go of attachments.</p>
              <p>An attachment is like a hook that ties us to something or someone or some belief or some aspect of this 3rd dimensional Earth. As long as this hook is present, there is no way one can Ascend or leave this 3rd dimensional realm permanently. Even after physical death, they will return to be reincarnated in another physical life because of that attachment/hook, until the day/lifetime comes when they have learnt to truly Let Go of that attachment/hook.</p>
              <p>Everyone will go through countless lifetimes to encounter various life experiences. And many of those experiences are meant to teach and test people's level of Attachment, be it attachment to certain beliefs, emotions, people, thoughts, items etc. And often, people are stuck in many lifetimes just because of a single attachment.</p>
              <p>When people are stuck in countless lifetimes of killing and hurting others (in words or actions) over their beliefs or affiliations, they have yet to learn to Let Go of their beliefs and to Respect others. The Universe is truly complex and no one on Earth knows everything about the Universe.</p>
              <p>When people are stuck in countless lifetimes of experiencing emotional pain of losing loved ones either through death or separation, they have yet to learn to understand the process of Life and Death,or to Let Go of their emotions when their loved ones leave. When people have learnt to truly love unconditionally without Attachment, they would have mastered Unconditional Love.</p>
              <p>When people are stuck in countless lifetimes of experiencing strong negative emotions and resulting situations, they have yet to learn to forgive themselves and others and to Let Go of their negative emotions.</p>
              <p>The list goes on. I'm just giving a few examples, in the hope that everyone who reads this can start to ponder upon your own lives to reflect if you are holding on to any Attachment that is causing problems in your life. Being aware of one's personal issues is the first step in healing and improving one's life. It will help greatly in one's life, whether or not they wish to Ascend in this lifetime.</p>

              <p>"let go' is not an easy thing to do at all. For example, in a statement like 'I want to let go'... there is a 'want'.  A want is a desire and so is not a complete 'let go'. Additionally, we often feel the need to let go when we experiences lot of suffering.. let go process entails inevitable struggle and suffering.</p>
              <p>True release starts after the 'I' or sense of personhood/self/ego is dropped. Before the no-self understanding, there is always a person that is 'wanting' to let go.</p>
              <p>Real 'let go' is an automatic release. After the release, there is neither an ordinary happiness nor some kind of desired-based effect.. what is left is an equanimous feeling. Equanimity has also 'released/let go' of the need to be happy. So, in another word, realisation is not a conventional kind of happiness..  Instead, it has a equanimity feeling.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Furthermore...true 'let go' is not caught in some kind of a story-telling that thoughts are conjuring. It has gone beyond the realm that is spell-binded by thoughts and meanings conjured by story of personhood... The experience is impossible to described with words ... it should be personally experienced instead.</p></div>

              <p>Well said, and insightful.</p>
              <p>May I also add that while letting go of one's lower self is important, it is even more crucial to give up our attachment to a higher SELF. Many people seem to know how to talk about letting go of our lower self, but actually got trapped pathetically by grasping at a higher SELF. Effectively, these people (who know very litttle but assume alot) are merely transferring their attachment from one's lower illusive self to a constructed higher SELF, equally devoided of any reality. They think they have found the solution, but actually have created more problems.</p>
