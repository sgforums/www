              <p>21 December 2012 had passed. While it may appear to be a non-event for majority of people on Earth, it had started a great shift/change in the people who are ready. I had been contacted by people who suddenly experienced Universal Awakening, and had a brand new perspective of their lives. Things that they had believed in or had done for much of their lives suddenly lost their importance. Things which they never believed in or never tried suddenly felt so true and real to them.<br> <br>I got a call from a very excited middle-aged lady who related to me how she suddenly felt totally different when she woke up one day end of last year. Then she couldn't stop surfing online for spiritual matters like past lives, Ascension, DNA Activation, etc. These are things that were foreign to her all along until that fateful day. There are many other people who had experienced changes in themselves during the last few months. For people who had already Awakened prior to 21 Dec 2012, many continue to have new experiences and insights about their lives, to guide them to have more positive, happier and healthier lives.<br> <br>Since December 2012, I have also been helping many people access their Higher Consciousness/Self and recall their Past Life memories, to help them understand more deeply about their current life situations, past life backgrounds, and other current life questions/answers. The reason is that the Universe is guiding and helping as many people as possible who are ready and open to learn about the Truth of Life and the Universe.<br> <br>However, as I've often highlighted, not everyone on Earth is ready to be Awakened and understand about what really goes on in the Universe. There's no right or wrong. It's how Evolution is. People who are ready to progress and evolve further in their soul life will do so in this lifetime. People who want/need more time to continue learning about life in a 3rd dimensional world will continue to experience purely 3rd dimensional experiences, which is how life on Earth had been for the past thousands of years up till 2012. In a 3rd dimensional world, duality exists, so negativity and positivity co-exist, so there will always be lots of conflicts,  events and situations that cause negative emotions, major and death-threatening illnesses, etc.<br> <br>The Shift of 2012 is a long process that will take a couple of decades to complete, and 21 December 2012 only marked the 'official' end of an old Age/Cycle and start of a New Age/Cycle. There are smaller Cycles within bigger Cycles, that the Universe is experiencing. The largest Cycle took 26,000 years to complete. For those of you who have been in existence in earlier Cycles and can recall your past lives back then, you may remember what happened and naturally understand that with each change of Age/Cycle, massive changes will need to happen.<br> <br>With these massive changes, the population will need help to adapt, whether it is from the natural disasters or from the massive social/political/economic changes. In our current Shift and Change of Cycles, the human physical body is going to also experience major changes to adapt to the new higher frequencies of Earth. All these wide-ranging changes are not easy for people in general to understand and overcome.<br> <br>That is why the Universe has arranged for large numbers of souls/Beings with the necessary skills and experience to be on Earth during this period to assist in this massive Universal Project. That is why I'm here. That is why many of you who are are reading this are here. No one is more important than anyone else. Every one of us have a role to play in the much bigger scheme of things in the Universe. I understand my role. Do you know your role and life purpose? If you're in Singapore, and you can make sense of this posting and my previous postings, and wish to fulfill your life purpose in this lifetime, contact me at <a href="http://www.LivingLightUniverse.com">www.LivingLightUniverse.com</a> .<br> </p>

              These are some "ascension" symptoms which I experienced/noticed personally. As souls are unique, individuals have different qualities and will "sense" differently so this is just an example rather than a full list.
              
              1. Slower/Stop aging
              
              2. Thirsty ( Always drink lots of pure drinking water, avoid sugary drinks )
              
              3. Change in appetite ( Certain food will taste like "poison", wheat/flour, grains/nuts, fruits and vegetables are more suitable. Food that are unsuitable will cause my stomach to get bloated or diarrhoea. ) 
              
              4. Weight Loss (I ate 2 to 3 meals a day, and I lost about 11kg from Mar 2012 to Mar 2013. Now I tried eating 3~4 meals, still unable to gain weight)
              
              5. Thoughts and emotions are amplified (Last longer and stronger)
              
              6. More sensitive to negative emotions ( When I stand close to someone that is "black hearted", I will feel like "ants biting" around chest upper heart area.)
              
              7. Able to relax and still my mind easily. (No thoughts and do nothing, time seems to fly faster)
              
              8. Energy seems to be constantly moving up and down my body, even peeing will feel pleasurable.
              
              9. See things differently... (When I look up at the sky everyday during daytime, the entire sky is filled with small moving energy particles... and the weird thing is, I have not know anyone else that is able to see it)
              
              10. Beauty : you are all beautiful souls, forever pure and innocent. An ascending soul is one that sees the Divine in everything and in everyone.

              <p>I see them (moving energy particles) very often.. sometimes they are like lightballs moving like tadpoles... if I just stare blankly into the open space or sky. Many people will see it if they relax and stare into the sky. </p>
              <p>But this is not the same depth as looking/penetrating into the fabric of Truth Reality. There are depths in the Reality when penetrated presents a 'vision' different from what un-realised Beings see.  <em style="line-height: 1.231;"> Related post : <a href="/forums/1728/topics/467155">http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/467155</a></em></p>

              <p>Depends on what is considered as evolution...</p>
              <p>Basically there are 2 directions that can be undertaking at each given moment...</p>
              <p>First direction: Understand and see the world in a way that does not reflect the truth. This is as per ignorance in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Second direction: Got a start in seeing the world accurately (aka insight/initial realisation).... Life understanding gradually transforms towards the establishment and actualisation of correct experiencing.</p>

              <p><br>First of all, people tend to think of "evolution" using the Darwin form of evolution, ie. humans came from single cell lifeform evolve till they become apes then humans. :) That is what scientists hypothesise using the available information they have.</p>
              <p>But in reality, how the current 'version' of humans came about is tightly linked to Earth's ancient history, long time ago, many Cycles/Ages ago. Because each Cycle/Age takes thousands of years, people who can remember enough details of past lives will be able to remember and understand this. Ancient records, such as those by Sumerian civilisation, contains some information about this. All the Religious texts, when taken as a whole, instead seeing from the individual religious perspectives, will also be able to verify this. Evolution that is currently happening again, involves a new 'version' of the human body/mind which is able to handle the new and much higher frequency of Earth.</p>
              <p>The Shift is the catalyst or changing of the frequency in the Universe that includes Earth, that enables the evolution to take place in the human body. Outwardly, it may not appear very different for the time being, but on the cellular and mind/body/spirit level, it will be very different. People who are unable to make the Shift well, and are not able to adapt to the new Earth's frequency will find themselves more and more out-of-balance physically/emotionally/mentally.</p>

              Ok, so we got 2 ways to go:
              1) Evolve the Form
              2) Evolve the Essence
              
              Just like the Protoss and the Zerg
              
              I rather choose the essence

              <p><br>haha... Interesting way of comparison. :)</p>
              <p>The humanoid body has been proven to be quite suitable for the various complex tasks, so the form is not expected to change. That is why there are many humanoid civilisations outside Earth, though they may be different in overall built/size.</p>
              <p>The key changes that is taking place in people on Earth now has mostly to do with the mind, and how it connects with the physical body and the Universe. That can have very great impact on people as the mind controls how we think and feel. People's diet preferences can also change as a result of the mind telling the body what food is healthier for it.</p>
              <p>The mind can give the people much deeper insights about how their lives can be more meaningful and positive. The mind can enable people to connect directly with the Universe, and understand the Universe better, far beyond what has been written about it by scientists who have no personal experience connecting with the Universe. The Shift and Evolution taking place now is helping people to be ready to live as Galactic beings able to interact and live with more advanced civilisations outside Earth. This process will take at least 10 years for enough humans to be ready.</p>

              Wow, that's cool, humans being able to fully develop and use their own psionic abilities.
              (I love the technology of the Protoss, it's made life so convienent)
              
              That's one motivation for us humans to keep challenging the limits of our knowledge, explore.

              <p>Everyone can choose to develop more of their mind's power, if and only if, they can first clear their minds of stuff that are blocking their growth. With the mind using all its energy process to the constant mind chatter of our daily life, it is not possible for the mind to evelop its full potential. When the mind is clear, it can do very amazing things. :)</p>
              <p>Of course, the level of development of each person differs, as it also depends on their lifeplan, past life experiences and level of soul advancement. </p>

              <p>We are very much responsible for our own lives and the consequences, from the options we choose to make. :)</p>
              <p>Being able to understand and internalise this in our lives, is a huge part of the process of Self-Mastery and spiritual (be it religious or non-religious) growth. When we continue to attribute our life circumstances to the result of others' actions, and feel that we are helpless to improve the situation, we will block ourselves from accessing the power within us.</p>
              <p>When we can understand that everyone and everything is inter-connected in the Universe, regardless of how separated and different it appears, and we feel we can improve our lives and overcome our life challenges, without harming or taking advantage of others, the Universe will help and guide us to have the wisdom and power to do it.</p>
              <p>This is a Shift of thinking and consciousness from what had been for the past thousands of years when people are totally disconnected from the Universe, and so existed in a survival mode mostly. That is what has been causing all the fighting, quarreling, backstabbing, jealousies, plotting, betrayals, controlling, etc in the various forms of human relationships (family, work, social, etc).</p>
              <p>The Earth is evolving currently to a higher dimensional world, which can only accommodate people and situations with positive emotions, thoughts and actions. Because of that, people will go through all sorts of life challenges to give them the opportunity to grow to that state of Being. This is why often, people who recover from life threatening illnesses or major crises are totally transformed and become very much more positive people after overcoming their crisis.</p>
              <p>Of course, as with any evolution process or school exam, not everyone is expected to have the same "results", depending on their efforts and readiness. Everyone will experience what their soul is ready to experience in this lifetime. There is no right or wrong, no good or bad, as everyone is unique and has their personal soul journeys to make.</p>
