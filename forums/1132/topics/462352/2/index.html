              <p>Due to institutional pressures and media blackout, news of the massive Earth changes that are already happening and will intensifying in the coming years are not able to reach the masses. There is alot of politics at work that is preventing the information from being known. Many people around the world who have already "gained their connections with the Universe" are not sharing the information publicly yet, but there will be events happening that will give them the courage to speak of what they know.</p>
              <p>Do have a look at this video below. If you are concerned that the information shared about Creation is contrary to your respective beliefs, fear not, as they actually help to fill in the blanks of the various mainstream religious texts and historical facts.</p>

              <p>Tomorrow is finally 21.12.12, the start of a new Age which so many people and Beings from all over the Universe have trained and prepared for, for countless lifetimes. Many things are going on to help facilitate the massive Earth changes ahead, though they are not obvious yet. Without connecting to the new energies on Earth, 21.12.12 will just come and go, like any other day.</p>
              <p>If you can set aside some quiet time, clear all thoughts in your mind for just that short while, and just enjoy the silence, you can then tune in, and connect with the upgraded energies on Earth, and feel and know it for yourself, without waiting for the physical signs to be visible. You will be amazed at the healing and wisdom you can gain from the experience! :)</p>
              <p>For me personally, this week, I have been feeling a sense of peacefulness and bliss, and the Universe wants me to keep myself as free as possible, and just ground/anchor Light/energy from Source to Mother Earth, in preparation for tomorrow. For the rest of you also working with Light/energy, what have you been feeling and experiencing this week?</p>

              <p>I am in a really good mood this past 3 days. <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><br><br>The Precessional Alignment is over, and it is meeting or exceeding some expectations, and failing to meet others, 
              depending on the level and type of expectations you and I may have.<br><br>Personally, the experience for myself turned out much better than I expected.<br><br>I did not see any fearful behaviour in my area, which is good.<br><br>I experienced a period of high energy.<br><br>The
               way I feel these energies, these energies enter from the base of my 
              foot (sometimes left foot, more often from my right foot), then rise all
               the way up to the crown chakra.<br><br>Some you may experience your 
              entire body "heating up" when receving this energy, so do drink more 
              pure water as your body need really it.<br><br>I only managed to sleep 
              like around 3-4 hours each day, because each time I recevied a "spike", I
               woke up from my sleep, then go back to sleep for a while, then "spike" 
              again...(repeat.. several times day and night...)<br><br>On the 22nd 
              (Satuday), I was trying to take a nap in the afternoon, then I felt my 
              heart vibrating, which woke me up again. This "heart vibrating" happened
               only once over the period of 3 days.<br><br>Lesson learnt: "Resistance 
              is pain". The more I resist, the more painful my experience will be. 
              When I accept these energies (usually we named these energies as 
              kundalini and prana), it will be easier.</p>

              To all lightworkers/helpers: ( Good job and well DONE ! )
              
              This is now a golden opportunity to create a new Earth, by focusing intensely on what we want to manifest, and making plans to move forward with its creation.
              We have more help than ever before than the entire history of this planet.
              
              Legions of angels, archangels, ascended masters and beings of Light are assisting us in making this transition from a world of darkness and despair into one of joyful, enthusiastic love and compassion.
              
              Because we have free will, it is up to us to keep up with the "Earth's Ascension" process.
              
              Together, we are creating a new world to replace oppression, control, fear, misery, lack, poverty, judgment, hatred and ignorance. We are shining our Infinite Light and Love deep into the darkest corners of the world, bringing Light to places that have all but forgotten who we really are.

              <p>To all lightworkers/helpers: ( Good job and well <span>DONE</span> ! )</p>
              <p>This is now a golden opportunity to create a new Earth, by
                  focusing intensely on what we want to manifest, and making plans to
                  move forward with its creation.<br> We have more help than ever before than the entire history of this
                  planet.</p>
              <p>Legions of angels, archangels, ascended masters and beings of
                  Light are assisting us in making this transition from a world of
                  darkness and despair into one of joyful, enthusiastic love and
                  compassion.</p>
              <p>Because we have free will, it is up to us to keep up with the
                  “Earth’s Ascension” process.</p>
              <p>Together, we are creating a new world to replace oppression,
                  control, fear, misery, lack, poverty, judgment, hatred and
                  ignorance. We are shining our Infinite Light and Love deep into the
                  darkest corners of the world, bringing Light to places that have
                  all but forgotten who we really are.</p>

              <p>Nothing much happened... There is no blackout or power outage as 'predicted/advocated' by you guys. </p>
              <p>At night when i sleep, there is oceanic feeling... like consciousness spreading out in space... But that is not something new as i have experienced these many times (after stabilising no-self realisation). So, I do not know whether this is the effect of new energy or just effect from normal spiritual practice.</p>

              <p>Actually there is no such thing as attaining enlightenment. It is more like a discovery of what is already there... and establishing the discovery/realisation directly into everyday life.</p>
              <p>On a separate note, sometimes, people can drop hints or create conditions before they re-incarnate so that they can 'remember' what they intend to do. </p>
