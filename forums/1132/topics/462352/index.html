              <p>I'm really excited and looking forward to 12.12.12 and 21.12.12, even though I know all the mass media around the world are most probably going to have a blast on 22.12.12 making fun of all the mis-information spread about 21.12.12, without understanding its significance and effects on Earth and mankind. It is not a 1-day "End of the World" event but a Universal process called by various names like "The Shift" (<a href="/forums/1132/topics/444441">http://sgforums.com/forums/1132/topics/444441</a>) that takes a couple of decades to complete, that will affect everyone and everything on Earth.</p>
              <p>Because of my healing and life guidance work, I get to see the people who are suddenly experiencing major unprecedented and strange changes in their bodies, thoughts, emotions and lives. If you can already feel and are experiencing the upcoming Earth Shift, hang in there for the wild ride. While transitional changes may be tough and even unbearable, the eventual outcome will be a very positive and uplifting one. :)</p>
              <p>I strongly recommend everyone to watch this 1.5hr film/documentary that the official Messenger of the Mayans, Grand-Elder of the Mayan Council is using to tell the world about the real significance of December 2012. The video is free for viewing till 21.12.12. It is not about 3 days of darkness or doomsday that people are joking about. There is a real serious message for all to know, that will help everyone understand better the reasons for the upcoming massive changes on Earth within the next 2 decades. The Mayan Grand-Elders are psychics who have the ability to receive information from across and beyond time, whether it is past, present or future.<br><br>The more life experience (from all lifetimes up till now) people have, the more meaningful the video will be to them.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>"If you are sleeping, it is Time to wake up. If you are resting, it is Time to walk."</em><br></span></strong><br>Video link (free for viewing till 21.12.12 only):<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.shiftoftheages.com/watch-now/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">http://www.shiftoftheages.com/watch-now/</span></a><br><br><br>Note: Much metaphors were used, so some of the points may not be easily understood by people without sufficient background, eg. the part about the unification of the Eagle and Condor is really about the unification of everyone's Mind and Heart from this point onwards, and not really about the physical reunion of the indigenous populations in the Americas.</p>

              <p>What we're going through is Evolution (which is Universal and not religious), and everyone will go through it at different pace. The pace is determined by everyone's past life experiences as well as their life plans. Those who had experienced and had completed more life lessons and cleared most of their negative karma would be among the early batch to go through the changes.</p>
              <p>However, the people who will experience the most dramatic, most sudden and even traumatic changes would be people who have alot of outstanding life lessons yet to be completed from past lives and have much negative karma to clear. While this group of people may go through much suffering this lifetime, it should not be interpreted as punishment by the Universe. It is the Universe giving them the opportunity to play catch-up with everyone else, by compressing what they need to complete within the remaining timeframe, so that as many of them can also be ready to join the others who have been evolving faster in their many lifetimes.</p>
              <p>Come 12.12.12 and 21.12.12, there would be a certain percentage of people who would feel and even see the changes. In fact, they most probably are already feeling and seeing the changes now. Majority of people on Earth will not notice much difference yet. But the visible changes in people and Earth will accelerate as the months and years pass.</p>
              <p>The changes in people's thoughts, emotions and lives are the powerful changes, as it will affect people directly, as compared to external changes. When it comes, it can be very sudden or gradually. People's entire perspective of life can change completely, and their feelings towards people close to them might also suddenly change.</p>
              <p>What was once important to them may suddenly feel meaningless. What was once thought true may suddenly feel so fake. What was once thought as unreal may suddenly feel like true reality. People whom one loves may suddenly seem to be too different in wavelength and mindset to be compatible anymore. One who has never thought about others' welfare may suddenly feel like doing volunteer work to help others unconditionally. The whole list of possible changes in people are wide-ranging but are all meant to be positive.</p>
              <p>However, as part of the evolving process, people may feel worse and even traumatic before they can feel better and more positive. That is why the changes can be very difficult to people if they are not aware of what is happening to them.</p>

              <p><br>It is Evolution, which everyone will experience. Depending on each person's intention and soul readiness, he/she will progress and advance at different rates, and will go through different experiences. Yes, you are right about Transcendence, but that will only apply to the people who are ready to advance and evolve beyond duality, the 2-state way of life on Earth, where Positive and Negative energies are constantly at work in people's lives.</p>
              <p>The reason why Earth is the way she is, is because it is meant to provide a learning ground for people. So, it is impossible for the existing 3rd dimensional Earth to provide a perfectly positive life, because duality is an integral part of Earth's purpose. However, we're now preparing for the Shift (or Ascension), which gives the opportunity for people who have already resolved their past life and current life issues, cleared their negative karma, and learnt their necessary life lessons in their current life to Transcend duality and Ascend to a higher dimensional world, where duality is no longer necessary.</p>
              <p>I have regressed many people back to their past lives in the higher dimensions where duality does not exist, so they can really feel and remember that totally blissful and peaceful way of life, that is not possible on Earth. :)</p>

              <p><br>Hey Milo,</p>
              <p>hehe...yeah, I admit the info that I share is not easy to digest, but it will help anyone who is willing to expand his/her mind to info that can help in their lives, either now or in the future. The Universe is extremely complex, and it is growing every moment, as people, Beings, souls grow in Consciousness. There are countless 'projects'  and 'experiments' being carried out all over the Universe and Multiverses, and the experiences and results gained from them continue to add on to the complexities. Earth is a Universal project that went haywire, but allowed to develop to see its results. This project is fast coming to an end, and it's time to move on the next phase, "5th dimensional New Earth", and so many massive changes will be experienced on Earth in this lifetime.</p>
              <p>Experiences on Earth for the last thousands of years is just a tiny fraction of what really happens in All-That-Is. Reason is Earth has been under a form of Universal quarantine to limit the negativity of Earth to this planet, so that majority of the people do not have access to Universal knowledge that can allow them to cause harm to Beings and planets outside Earth. It's like a naughty child being grounded indoors at home for misbehaving, while his friends get to have fun outside the house. :) That is also the reason why many people on Earth have been conditioned to believe (incorrectly) that Earth is the only planet with intelligent lifeforms.</p>
              <p>After 2012, people will be exposed to much more of what really happens "out there". It's part of my role to help provide the necessary info for anyone who is ready to understand more. It's perfectly fine if one is happy with their current reality, but without understanding what is going on, Life will soon become harder and harder to make sense of.</p>
              <p>Many exciting, incredible and unbelievable things are going to happen this lfietime, and most people currently in their 40's and younger should have the opportunity to witness and experience them. :)</p>

              <p>12.12.12 had passed. Some of you might have felt different yesterday, whether positive emotions or physical symptoms that made you feel sick or uncomfortable. Just to share my personal experience: I was feeling very good in the morning, but by the afternoon, I got a very clear vision of marching soldiers, a jet fighter and a cruise missile. That came from a much higher 13th dimension (Earth is only of 3rd dimension) with the message that Earth has to stop warring. After that, my body heated up tremendously and lasted till the night.</p>
              <p>If you are more sensitive to energy, you may have felt sick yesterday, but it's the body's way of adjusting to the rising Earth frequency.</p>
