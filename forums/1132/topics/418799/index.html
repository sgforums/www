              <p>This is in response to the thread: <a href="/forums/1132/topics/408223">http://sgforums.com/forums/1132/topics/408223</a></p>
              <p>As the thread is getting too long, i think it is better to break away from it in order not to hijack it.</p>
              <p>My opinion in that in the area of spiritual practice which encompasses dealing with life in general, it is not good enough to just understand things as theory and concept. The practice and gaining of experience is more important than the theory and thinking.</p>
              <p>For example, we may read about theory that talks about how to dealing with anger, unpleasant emotions as such... But we will often find that when it comes to the actual situation, we are unable to pull out of the unpleasantness.</p>
              <p>It will take a lot of practice and re-alignment of the mindset to gradually break away from old ways. Additonally, the correct application of understanding/insight is also important.</p>
              <p>To illustrate... when anger (or any other emotion such as fear) arises, we find that it is very difficult to overcome it and it gives a lingering unpleasantness to one's experience. The root of the problem is that the anger is actually a manifestation of the ego/self.. the more  you try to get rid of it, it just can't go away. As long as the 'sense of self' is in operation, the anger will not be dissolved by willing and therefore one will feel miserable.</p>
              <p>Here the insight of no-self and <strong>how no-self feels like in REALTIME</strong> is important. No-self allows the sensation of anger, reason for anger and the tension of the body to be made conscious and felt wholly and impersonally. This allows the anger and the unpleasant sensation to move through (aka arising and passing away).</p>
              <p>So, do not think that the path to discovery is a high and unreacheable goal...it is not. It is just a matter of understanding and applying. It is of beneficial use that have huge implication for everyday living.</p>
              <p>In trying times, the understanding and all the dry-runs will be put to test ...</p>
              <p>Please.. this is just a sharing of experience which i hope will be helpful to some people. For me, the insight of no-self was established several years ago...Til this day, there are still certain situations that will envelop one in a sense of self... but with the growing of experience, bit by bit the pull of self gets lesser and lesser... resulting in lesser psychological suffering/misery.</p>
              <p>Merry Christmas everyone :)</p>
