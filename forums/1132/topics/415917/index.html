              <p>You may want to control your fear first. Not being able to hear the voices clearly does not mean they are from negative entities. Voices from higher dimensions are generally very fast, and high-pitched, as they are of much higher frequency than our normal range of hearing/speech. The more spiritually evolved the being, the higher frequency is his/her voice. There are also many visiting (positive) spirits as well as lost souls (ghosts) in our world, though few people are aware of their presence.</p>
              <p>Since you have already gained your ability to communicate with your Higher Self, you can ask your Higher Self during your meditation whose voices did you hear, and what you need to do about them. If the voices are from positive entities of the Light, they may have important/valuable info for you, but it's up to you how you wish to proceed.</p>
              <p>If the voices are from ghosts, perhaps they are asking for help to move on to the Light. If the voices are from negative entities from the Dark, then drop me an email. This is not the place to explain more details, as not all readers are of the Light. :)</p>

              <p>Or you could be hallucinating, and hearing stuff that conjured up by your subconscious.  </p>
              <p>What do you think of before you go to bed? Are you worried or stressed about hearing the voices before you go to sleep?</p>
              <p>When this entire episode started, were you feeling stressed about an important decision you have to make and wished someone could advise you?</p>
              <p>I highly recommend talking things out with friends or family members instead of keeping it in.  Sometimes, it even helps to talk to yourself about it.</p>

              <p>Soul Divine,</p>
              <p>Firstly, don't be afraid... and  you also need not push the voice away.</p>
              <p>The voices cannot harm you at all. It can cause you to be miserable by being worried, due to focussing on them.</p>
              <p>There can be quite a few possibilities, but for all possibilites just stay calm.</p>
              <p>1. Some Beings talking to you.</p>
              <p>2. One of your unconscious aspects coming back, trying to integrate.</p>
              <p>If the problem persist, you might want to take an aura photo to see what is happening. If the aura photo is dark or black in colour, you may have a dark force interference.</p>
              <p>Additionally, it is not good to alway think in terms of light and dark... this will breed attraction to one and aversion to another. This way, one cannot progress and come to a point of peace..</p>
              <p>On the spiritual path, dealing with different kinds of experiences is inevitable.</p>

              <p><br>I believe SoulDivine has that ability to know in this lifetime. As for when he can gain that level of spiritual ability, depends on how his life progresses, and when the time is right for him. hehe...</p>
              <p>When we are able to understand what happens in our lives, and be able to remove all our fears and attachments, we will naturally be at peace and bliss. Nothing is random in Life; everything happens for a reason.</p>
              <p>Of course, not everyone needs to have the same depth of understanding of the Universe, if the details are not useful for his/her lifeplan. A person who is only in this lifetime to learn a basic life lesson about genuinely caring for his/her parents, may not need to know about the Dark entities in this world which are influencing people's minds to cause them to commit suicide.</p>
              <p>Choosing not to understand, by 'blindfolding' ourselves or 'focusing on a beautiful illusion/hologram', is also a valid option taken by many people, provided we don't grow more fears as a result when all the blindfolds and illusions/holograms are finally taken away eventually in the coming years.</p>
              <p>The inability to distinguish Light from Dark is what is causing many people around the world to be misguided by Dark entities/influences in disguise, attracting all sorts of negative experiences into their lives instead of the positive lives they were meant to have. But there's nothing wrong with that per se, as it's still a good learning experience. Even in non-spiritual context, for example, sometimes a person who is unable to distinguish what is good or bad, may need to actually experience the harm that drugs cause to himself and his loved ones, before he finally learns the harm of drugs.</p>

              <p>I have this common sentance which I will silently tell myself, "I call in my higher self to do my very best <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif">".<br><br>I can give more details on my last morning experience.<br><br>I was having an interesting dream about "Development of electrical power generation system using very ancient and advanced technology". I did not see anyone. Then I heard the same voice calling me about 3-4 times., it always starts with "Name, blah blah blah blah". It sounds miserable/scary, like the "Ooooooooo" sound of a ghost which makes no sense to me. I carried on dreaming until I woke up with the year/number 1919.<br><br>How I feel about after this incident:<br><br>I am really curious right now, not worry or frightened. This "someone" IS certainly intelligent, he/she knows where I am at that time, knows my given name and also knows my weakness and also diverted my attention repeatedly by calling me by "name".<br><br>If it is important message for me, it will "sound very clear", just one short sentance I know what it means/trying to say.

              <p>I feel you're scaring yourself somehow.</p>
              <p>Beings in the higher dimensions/realms know almost EVERYTHING (past, present and future) of EVERYONE in the lower dimensions/realms, except for certain details that are blocked by people's Spirit Guides to protect them. That is how I carry out my deep healing and energy work, with the help of Higher Beings from the higher realms, as I'll need to know past life and lifeplan details of total strangers to help them resolve their karmic and life lesson issues.</p>
              <p>Forget about ghost or horror movies, which are mostly and ridiculously nonsensical and untrue, with regards to ghosts and spirits. They are mostly make-belief by movie makers to make profits by instilling fear, not to educate the public.</p>
              <p>Regarding the dream you had, you may well see that in use in this world in the coming years, as the world's energy industry will be "entirely revamped", as it's currently causing huge damage to Earth.</p>
              <p>I personally feel your intuitive senses are pretty sharp, though you haven't quite gotten the hang of using it to its fullest potential yet in your life. But you should focus on trusting that you have the power to prevent any negative entities from harming you. Once you have that fear in you, it's like opening a door to intruders.</p>
              <p>If you still feel scared when going to bed, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">visualise and feel</span></strong> white golden Light surrounding you, like a protective shield, and make the intention that it be there throughout the night to protect you from negative energies. Ideally, you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should not</span> need to do this to feel safe, as some people end up scaring themselves, and do this every night! That is not progressing, and may end up causing the fear to remain in you.</p>
              <p>While Dark entities sometimes try to extinguish/dim the Light in people (which they have been pretty successful for thousands of years), if they find that we are not afraid of them, and our Light and minds are strong enough to repel them, they will leave us alone, as it's wasting their efforts/energy. Furthermore, if they are not strong enough in their Dark energy, they may end up being extinguished by our Light instead, if we are strong enough! ;)</p>
              <p>Light and Dark energies are just energies of polar opposites in this 3D illusionary world of duality, where opposites will ALWAYS exist forever and ever, to allow people here to learn from both Light (positive) and Dark (negative) experiences. The only difference is in the balance of Light and Dark energies. Currently, Earth's Dark/negative energies are way too strong, because of the many beings that have contantly maintained and grew them, generation after generation. But the balance of energies is changing soon, very soon. These coming years will see the balance being tipped over in favour of the Light finally after thousands of years of Dark influence.</p>
              <p>But eventually, Dark/negative energies will still exist, though very much weakened. The key Dark beings will also be "removed" by the Universe, to allow people on Earth to start afresh in a certain way. And that is why those of us Ascending in this lifetime will be leaving for the higher dimensions where the Dark energies no longer exist, because Dark energies cannot 'survive' in the much higher frequencies where Light is way too strong.</p>
              <p>Which brings me back to your current concern: if you are able to constantly raise your vibrational frequency, your capacity to hold the Light in you will grow, and as you keep on healing yourself energetically, the Light in you will also grow. When your Light is strong enough, no Dark entities/energies can harm/influence you.</p>
              <p>Incredible as this may sound for many readers, but I believe that you understand all that I've shared, right? ;)</p>

              <p>Actually, when Higher Beings (for most people would just be their personal Spirit Guides) from higher dimensions communicate with us, some of them like to use numbers to signal to us when to pay attention in our daily life. Broadly, communication with them can be through:</p>
              <p>a) 'online mode': carried out in various forms of meditative states, where 2-way communication is done.</p>
              <p>b) 'offline mode': if there is an 'assigned code' eg. a set of numbers, if we 'happen' to see that number somewhere, it could be our Spirit Guide trying to get us to pay attention or think of something, as their way of providing guidance. Of course, this can only work well if a person's intuitive senses has grown to be quite sharp, or his "spiritual antenna" is working properly, else he won't be able to take note of those occasions, or make much sense of those times. Not every occasion when that 'code' appears is meaningful, but if we are able to be intuned, we'll intuitively know. :)</p>
              <p>For me personally, I had just 1 set of code in the beginning, but now it has grown to many sets of codes, as the need now for the Higher Realms to guide me intensifies, as the 'countdown' begins. I also know which code is from which Higher Being.</p>
              <p>For TS, he may wish to take note of any significance in his daily life whenever the number '1919' happens to catch his eye, eg. what thoughts were in his mind at that very moment.</p>
              <p>It's actually quite a fun learning journey, once a person is able to get the hang of it. Everyone has a few Spirit Guides from the higher dimensions/realms whose role is to help us complete our lifeplans successfully. Unfortunately, most people are not aware of their presence, or choose not to acknowledge them, so they lose extremely valuable teachers/guides/allies in their lives.</p>

              <p>As your DNA has already been fully and genuinely activated (as there are lots of con-artists around who claim to activate DNA with fanciful merchandise or dubious methods), you should not be overly surprised and scared if you suddenly realise and discover more and more of your psychic gifts and abilities, and gain knowledge that you have never even heard or read about. You have already gained the valuable gift of connecting with your Higher Self, and your intuitive senses are pretty sharp now.</p>
              <p>All these will come in very useful for your future, and will help you cope better with the coming years of changes. Some new abilities that you will be gaining may not make much sense or seem to be of value now, but their purpose will all make pefect sense to you in future. Everything happens for a reason. You will need to sharpen your intuitive senses even more, as they can guide you to safety when the world is no longer safe to live in, esp. if you need to travel around. Just enjoy the growing and discovery journey... :)</p>
              <p>We are entering a time when the Veil between dimensions is thinning fast. Those who are ready will receive help and guidance to regain their multidimensional abilities to prepare for their future in the higher dimensions. Psychic abilities are part and parcel of life in the higher dimensions, unlike here in this 3D world where they are often viewed with much fear and suspicion.</p>
              <p>For people with too much Dark influence, the Universe and their Spirit Guides generally will not allow them to gain much abilities, if any at all, as they would likely to abuse them for selfish desires or harm others. This is the reason why some people can never seem to feel any difference in themselves even after trying all ways to increase their psychic abilities, while others seem to grow by leaps and bounds in short periods of time. People who are able to genuinely help others in future will get the most help from the Universe.</p>
              <p>However, there are times when some people are allowed to gain great psychic abilities though their hearts are "questionable", because it's for them to learn important life lessons about abuse of power/abilities for negative deeds. For some people, the only way for them to learn the ways of Light is for them to fall deeper into the depths of darkness first.</p>

              <p>I also suggest u to pick up a religion and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>start practice it (quickly)</strong></span>. 
                      These voices are <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>warning signs</strong></span> that certain aspect of your life are out

              <p>On the otherhand, I think u better consult a doctor. Hearing voices and having mental
