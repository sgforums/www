              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>u have done something
              terrible in your life</strong></span> eg. harming other people,

              watching too much adult stuffs etc.</p>
              <p>I also suggest u to pick up a religion and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>start practice it
              (quickly)</strong></span>. These voices are <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>warning signs</strong></span> that
              certain aspect of your life are out of balance <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(or wrongful)</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>On the otherhand, I think u better consult a doctor. Hearing

              <p><br>It's true that some people genuinely have mental disorders, but there are unfortunately, many innocent people with very strong mental powers, who have been diagnosed wrongly (either intentionally or ignorantly) with mental illnesses and locked up, all over the world, often because doctors have no idea what they are dealing with.</p>
              <p>Mind-dumbing drugs are often prescribed long-term, that basically reduces a person's mental capability to a bare minimum, and considered as a cure. Fortunately, more and more of such victims are being given genuine help (from outside the medical industry) and are learning to understand their conditions and are taking back their inner strengths and freedom.</p>
              <p>The same goes for cancer treatment. When no better alternatives are known, simply use the most toxic substances they have to kill off cells, cancerous and healthy ones. While we often read about the few successful cases, but find out more about the many unnamed people who have died because of the toxic treatments. Same as using a cruise missile to kill one living target, together with many other innocent people.</p>
              <p>The global medical and pharmaceutical industry has many agendas behind some of the things they do publicly. Just like the truth behind the whole <a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/search/label/H1N1">H1N1 paranoia caused and their vaccines</a> have already been disclosed recently, others will also be revealed soon.

              <p><br>I cannot generalise, as everyone's case is unique. To be fair, it's true that some people really have mental disorders, because there is an imbalance of the chemicals in their brain. In such cases, medications could help.</p>
              <p>But in other cases, negative energetic attachments could be one possible reason, but not always.</p>
              <p>It can also be a positive development. Hearing voices, often prescribed as mental illnesses, could actually be because a person is starting to develop his/her clairaudient ability. If such people are given the appropriate spiritual guidance, they can use their gifts to help themselves and others. Typical religious beliefs view this as demonic, or the effect of evil spirits, so view people with such abilities as evil. Seriously, there are many non-physical beings/entities in the Universe; we often attract the beings that match our own alignment, Light or Dark. Having a holy external appearance doesn't mean a person is aligned with the Light. :)</p>
              <p>I'm a spiritual free-thinker, so shall not comment too much on the use of religion regarding your question. Meditation is not a religious practice, though Buddhism encourages it. Meditation on its own is basically a technique to relax the mind and breathing. Of course, it can be used for spiritual matters. Personally, I too encourage everyone to meditate regularly, as it has great benefits.</p>

              <p>Yes, I can do exorcism, but not in the ridiculously dramatic ways seen on TV and movies. Those are really mostly alot of action and drama, to entertain and scare audiences, but seriously, in real-life, I'm sure even ghosts would be entertained by such drama! :)</p>
              <p>Movies tend to portray exorcism as destroying evil spirits and demons. In real life, at least for what I do, it's more to help them let go of whatever attachments they have to this Earth realm that is preventing them from wanting to leave, and guide them to the Light. Most of the time, they have been stuck here in our realm for too long, that the 'Exit door' for them has long closed, so they need help to exit properly.</p>
              <p>Of the cases I've handled, it's usually to do with wanting justice, as they had been wrongly accused of some crimes or deeds, and so refuse to leave after their death, either to clear their names or to seek revenge.</p>
              <p>It's also a common situation where the ghost used to be the spouse/lover of a person in previous life, and the ghost was overly attached to this person, that it wasn't able to leave properly upon death, and so remained in this realm to look for its former lover/spouse. People who don't believe in reincarnation may find this explanation crazy, but that is how Life on Earth happens.</p>
              <p>This is also the reason why I often advise and guide people to let go of attachments in their life. Letting go of an attachment to a person does not mean not caring for or loving the person. It just means that we don't end up having an unhealthy link to the person, due to some inner fear we have, such as fear of losing the person.</p>
              <p>Entering/leaving a dimension is not as simple as we entering/leaving a room, whenever we want. So, even if they finally decide to leave this Earth realm, unless they get appropriate help, they would not be able to leave on their own.</p>

              <p>For those of us working with spiritual matters, often only cases that we can handle will be referred to us, by the Spiritual Realm. No one person in this world now is meant to help everyone. There would be certain reasons that we are called upon to help a particular case, because of our pastlife background, or connection with the person affected in this life. So, for the cases I've handled, yes, I've been able to do so.</p>
              <p>For cases where the person affected was the wrongdoer in a previous life, resulting in the ghost coming back to seek revenge, this person would often be required to apologise or do something. But often when such people come to me (guided by the Spiritual Realm though they are rarely aware of why they come to me), they have already suffered enough from serious illness or something negative in their life (such as suffer miscarriage, suffer severe depression or suffer mental problems), so in a way, the ghost has already taken revenge, so I would advise the ghost to stop, forgive and let go. Ghosts seldom know how to stop their actions, as their consciousness is stuck in their final state of mind.</p>
              <p>I don't use religious terms like "deva realms". I prefer to use a simple term "Spiritual Realm", that applies in general. In all religious texts, though different names are used, they are often referring to the same places, though described from different perspectives.</p>
              <p>There are no physical restrictions, such as Time, in the Spiritual Realm, so how things function there is totally different from here in 3D Earth realm. Each visit to the Spiritual Realm would be for a certain reason, so the appropriate beings and places would be made available for that particular visit. Eg. if we wish to visit the Hall of Records to access our Akashic Records, when we are there, we will see it there. If we wish to obtain other information, the appropriate source would be made available, whether it is a being or something.</p>
              <p>I'm describing the above from the perspective of my spiritual work. If someone not involved in spiritual work, but is just meditating and going to the Spiritual Realm to visit, most probably, their Spirit Guide (in the Spiritual Realm) will make available appropriate information or things to help him/her learn or understand about something relevant to their life.</p>

              <p><br>I always try to encourage and help people to be independent, in order for them to be able to help themselves in future. Everyone has great inner potential and wisdom, if they know how and are able to tap into them.</p>
              <p>You have a questioning mind, which is good. At this point in your life, you may find it hard to accept what someone tells you about your past lives. In your case, it would be better that you can feel it yourself, as what you'll find out would make more sense to you.</p>
              <p>There is always a right time for everything. Learning to free your mind from the many distractions in your life may be necessary for you before you find about your past lives, else the information won't help you much.</p>
              <p>When you able to feel calmer about your life, when you are able to meditate properly, make the intention in your mind to find out your past life details. My recommendation for you is a simple breath meditation without any religious application. When one's conscious mind is not able to let go, our daily life's ideas, thoughts and beliefs can cause the information you obtain to be inaccurate or incorrect.</p>
              <p>A person who is extremely passionate about something may end up thinking of past lives with a bias as his/her conscious mind's contents seeped into the session, unless he/she is able to block out his/her conscious mind from interfering. That is why sometimes we hear of <strong>many people </strong>claiming to be the <strong>exact same </strong>famous movie stars or religious leaders in their past lives.</p>
              <p>You can request to receive more specific details, such as a major mistake made in your past life, that you have yet to learn in this life. Calming your mind and heart may be a tough obstacle for you at present, but with regular practice, you can be less distracted by what goes on around you.</p>

              <p>Hi Rooney9,</p>
              <p>Just a sharing here. Nothing definitive.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is that you need to learn to stabilise the basic meditation skill first. The mind need to be relatively still in order to switch 'consciousness state'.  The basic focus on the breathe meditation will help to stabilise the mind and keep it from being distracted by wandering thoughts. There is a need for a duration of not focusing on the wandering thoughts in order for the mind/attention to switch to a different 'consciousness state'.</p>
              <p>The past life imageries can be like what is at the time or it can be symbolic representations. .. and we usually see only what is required or is requested.</p>

              <p>Yes, I can do exorcism, but not in the ridiculously dramatic ways seen on TV and movies. Those are really mostly alot of action and drama, to entertain and scare audiences, but seriously, in real-life, I'm sure even ghosts would be entertained by such drama! :)</p>
              <p>Movies tend to portray exorcism as destroying evil spirits and demons. In real life, at least for what I do, it's more to help them let go of whatever attachments they have to this Earth realm that is preventing them from wanting to leave, and guide them to the Light. Most of the time, they have been stuck here in our realm for too long, that the 'Exit door' for them has long closed, so they need help to exit properly.</p>
              <p>Of the cases I've handled, it's usually to do with wanting justice, as they had been wrongly accused of some crimes or deeds, and so refuse to leave after their death, either to clear their names or to seek revenge.</p>
              <p>It's also a common situation where the ghost used to be the spouse/lover of a person in previous life, and the ghost was overly attached to this person, that it wasn't able to leave properly upon death, and so remained in this realm to look for its former lover/spouse. People who don't believe in reincarnation may find this explanation crazy, but that is how Life on Earth happens.</p>
              <p>This is also the reason why I often advise and guide people to let go of attachments in their life. Letting go of an attachment to a person does not mean not caring for or loving the person. It just means that we don't end up having an unhealthy link to the person, due to some inner fear we have, such as fear of losing the person.</p>
              <p>Entering/leaving a dimension is not as simple as we entering/leaving a room, whenever we want. So, even if they finally decide to leave this Earth realm, unless they get appropriate help, they would not be able to leave on their own.</p>
