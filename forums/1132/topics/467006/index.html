              <p>Few people like to think of the topic of death until they are faced with it. Recently, a man asked me if I could help his wife who is in her 30's, previously had no serious illness, but suddenly fell very sick this February 2013, and was immediately diagnosed by the hospital as having advanced cancer with only 1-2 months left to live. I've been sharing with people about the increasing numbers of such 'unusual circumstances' for the last couple of years, in the hope that everyone can spare some time out of their busy lives and think deeper about their personal lives, their soul desires and their life purpose.</p>
              <p>There's a Universal reason for many people's lifespans becoming much shorter in our current era, which is why it's becoming more and more common now to see people in their 30's to 60's in the obituary columns. It's time to live the life that we truly want, not the life that others expect us to lead. It is time for everyone to clear all our inner issues (especially emotional issues) and seek a positive resolution with people in our lives. It is time to forgive and let go, instead of holding on to negative emotions towards ourselves and others. When the negative energy in us becomes too strong and has totally overwhelmed the positive energy in us, and if we are not able to bring in positive energy into our energy systems which we need for our survival and smooth functioning, our body will simply break down, and very serious illnesses can suddenly manifest in our body.</p>

              <p>From a spiritual view-point,</p>
              <p>Earth is now a for fourth density planet, unfortunately majority of humanity is still operating at third density consciousness. <br><br>It
               is going to be a painful experience for a human being to be of lower 
              vibration than the planet. Falling sick and feel like dying may become 
              the "norm" for people who are unable to keep up with the gradual rising 
              frequency.<br><br>It is important to acknowledge that the choice to 
              "exit" the physical body "early" is usually done at the soul level... 
              the longer the little ego self is not in alignment with the higher self,
               the more difficult it is to reconcile with itself.</p>

              Our world, especially SG, is increasing in population density.
              Higher population density means more stress on the body, the immune system.
              With an already overstressed immune system and body, we fall prey to other diseases that normally won't affect us.

              they were both born in 1984, which means that both are 28 years old this

              <p>That's because it's all part of the 'plan'. Singapore has limited
              land, yet government policy is geared towards greater immigration.
              What better way to have their cake and eat it than by making sure that
              once you are near the end of your economic usefulness you will
              'naturally' conk-off to make way for newer younger immigrants.
              Better still, it would mean more business for the restructured
              hospitals. I mean, how are the performance of our hospitals evaluated?
              It is all about the bottom line isn't it? How many million dollars in
              profit they make rather than the number of people they save and the
              declining rate of disease.
              Means testing could be the perfect cover. If you still have any money
              left, they will 'cure' you just enough (but never fully) to ensure
              they can squeeze the maximum out of you. Once you are bankrupt, they
              will tell you that your illness is terminal....so sorry!<br><br>-&gt; Not all hospital/clinics are more interested in making money only but it is quite true for <strong>pharmaceutical companies</strong>... more people falling sick means more people buying "medicine" which means more sales and profit for them...</p>
              <p>Another point I want to stress is that people need to know <strong>the fact that chlorine is toxic to the human body</strong> and it is added into our water supply...</p>

              <p>-&gt; Your ability to <strong>relax and do nothing</strong> is essential towards ascension / enlightenment. <br><br>If you spend most of the day in a relax~trance state (alpha~theta brain waves), you will notice that you don't really need to sleep much.

              <p>When our health and body breaks down, especially for life threatening illnesses, it is extremely difficult for most people to have quality of life anymore. Best not to wait till the time comes before we are forced to make changes in our lives and mindset. Physical illnesses are really messages/signals to the root causes, which are often emotional issues that we have been neglecting. For example, cancer is often caused by suppressed emotions for a long time.</p>

              Hi LLU, good to see you here again.
              
              I understand that some people believe that whether you live short or long life on the earth plane had actually been preplanned in the life after life/ Bardo/ life between life spiritual realm or predestine in most orthodox religious beliefs by the Unseen Creator/God.
              
              I for one would see that as just fated due to unforeseen circumstances like fatal accidents and it also depends the health lifestyle you adhere during your life sojourn on earth.

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Great to see your posting too! :)</p>
              <p>People in our modern era are too busy doing things that are causing harm and damage to our overall well-being. Besides taking care of our livelihood, ie. earning a living, we need to also take good care of our mental, emotional and spiritual well-being to be in balance with the Universe. Once the imbalance is too great, all sorts of problems can then manifest in our bodies and lives.</p>
              <p>I've been receiving and hearing more and more cases of people being diagnosed immediately by doctors and hospitals with final stage of cancer, even though they had been perfectly healthy all along. This situation will become more and more common, and people need to understand the reason for it. It's time for everyone to take stock of our own lives and reflect on the aspects that can be made more positive.</p>

              I would when I see someone is really suffering from great pain and misery. I would certainly choose that alternative for myself too knowing that its not worth living life in that kind of state and burdening my family with expensive medical expenses.
                  
              Would you see that as predestined by the Unseen Creator/God or preplanned by your own soul before you were born or reincarnated?

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Great to see your posting too! :)</p>
              <p>People in our modern era are too busy doing things that are
              causing harm and damage to our overall well-being. Besides taking
              care of our livelihood, ie. earning a living, we need to also take
              good care of our mental, emotional and spiritual well-being to be
              in balance with the Universe. Once the imbalance is too great, all
              sorts of problems can then manifest in our bodies and
              lives.</p>
              <p>I've been receiving and hearing more and more cases of people
              being diagnosed immediately by doctors and hospitals with final
              stage of cancer, even though they had been perfectly healthy all
              along. This situation will become more and more common, and people
              need to understand the reason for it. It's time for everyone to
              take stock of our own lives and reflect on the aspects that can be
              made more positive.</p>

              In other words you mean to say it is better not to know then know you have cancer? Is that something like psychological suggestion to that individual to believe it is true while the diagnose by doctors could be an error you mean?

              <p>No, that's not what I meant. :) What I meant is that illnesses, whether it's cancer or some disease is often caused by emotional issues or some deeper issues rather than purely physical reasons.</p>
              <p>By the time the diagnosis is made and confirmed, enough damage had already been made to the person's body, by whatever root cause it is, be it emotional, mental or even unresolved past life issue. Without resolving the root cause, it's often very difficult to completely heal the person's illness. That is why relapses happen quite frequently, even if the medical treatments initially worked.</p>

              <p><br>Our personal expectations of what we want our life to be makes a lot of difference in whether we can live contented and happyily with whatever we have. If we choose to live according to others' expectations, we can end up forever running on the wheel, like hamsters in a cage, with no end destination, just never-ending running. :)</p>

              <p>Knowing more about the Universe gives us much more opportunities to improve our health and hence lifespan. It will get more and more common for people to have illnesses that cannot be healed by medical practices and medicine, even if the symptoms appear very ordinary. It's all about the body trying to adjust to Earth's new frequency. Currently, there's no easily available device that can measure the subtle energy in people, so it's difficult for people to understand this.</p>
