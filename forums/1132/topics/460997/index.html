              <p>Below is a link to the recent news report on looters who take advantage during US' Super Storm Sandy disaster:</p>

Looting and robbery are the negative choices that many people will take. Such people can expect to experience more major disasters or life challenges in the years ahead to continue to 'test' their level of Consciousness. Should they consistently fail, it may be time for them to leave this world, as their vibrational frequency would have dropped too low to be in balance with Earth's rising frequency.<br><br>Ideally, people faced with disaster situations can find that goodness in their hearts and help others in need unconditionally. There would be such people around in every disaster, but given the level of Consciousness in most countries currently, the percentage is not high, sadly. And so, many people can expect to experience many more major life challenges in this lifetime.</div>

              <p>Nameste. I try to keep this short, base on how u say it, your point are one direction only. When infact there are many "grey" areas to this issue. </p>
              <p>Looting and robbing in general is bad. However sometimes there are circumstance that calls for it, </p>
              <p>lets say u are out of food and you really need food and u know the other place have food (Quoto "that place" doesn't have an owner or the owner evucated to another place) </p>
              <p>are u gonna not loot and die or loot and have the food to survive? </p>
              <p>What I'm trying to point here is that karma is not just karma alone. Karma normally mix with intention. </p>
              <p>So if I kill u by accident e.g driving and u ran on the road and I bang u down. Is it really my fault in the universal law? Unlikely. However if I want to bang u down coz I hate you and wish u to die then is another karmic meaning all together. Same goes to killing somebody, if u r in a hijacked plane and u know the hijacker is gonna get everyone kill if u don't kill him, are u at fault if u kill him? I highly doubt. Also sometimes people rob coz of past karma too. Same goes to some accidents etc. </p>

              <p><br>I understand where you're coming from. I'm just sharing real-life cases from people whom I've helped to regress to their past lives to resolve their current life issues, and the guidance given by Higher Beings. Even cases when people had been soldiers in their past lives and had killed others in a war are considered by the Universe to have done a negative deed and would need to learn from it in future lifetimes.</p>
              <p>Though it may seem unfair from human perspective, since the soldiers were ordered by their leaders in the past to kill their enemies, but to the Universe, everyone has free will to choose our actions, whether taking positive actions or negative ones. We don't live in a perfect world. In the case of soldiers who were ordered to kill, they could have chosen not to be soldiers to begin with, or could have chosen to disobey orders to kill. Yes, they could have suffered or even died in that past life as a result of their positive actions, but the Universe would not impose any negative karma to it, and in fact, if the people chose very positive or self-sacrificing actions, they would even have advanced spiritually.</p>
              <p>In the case of looting and robbery during disasters, a positive action would be to request for needed supplies from those who have. There would always be people who are willing to share. Therein lies the ideal situation: that everyone has grown spiritually and in Consciousness to be willing to share whatever little necessities we have in such emergencies, to help ourselves and others in need, instead of only worrying and caring for our personal well-being. :)</p>
              <p>I'm not sharing this as a theoritical moral education subject. It will be a very real testing situation for many people around the world in the years/decades ahead.</p>
