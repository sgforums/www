              <p>This is my opinion on 2012 ascension.</p>
              <p>There are people who think that some millions of people will go 5D at 2012 or some years later. My opinion defers.</p>
              <p>The ancient ancestors( Lemurian) times have a biological system that is different from ours. Their form is crystalline.  It will take generations to transform a current dna structure to that of the 4/5D ancestors. .. and it is dependent of realistions of truth about reality/consciousness as well as a simultaneously transformed habits influencing the chemistry and biology of body. Why is that so.. this is because karma is actually a kind of patterns that can be due to ignorance and/or it can be due to habits form over generations. The ancient ancestors biological structure enables them to not eat solid food and is androgynous. ... How many people do not need to eat? I do not see millions of people who do not need to eat food in this world now..</p>
              <p>Therefore, i don't think ascension is possible without a very deep mastery(realisation) of what is reality in truth. This is because, each dimension is what it is like due to a veil of illusion(ignorance) cast over it. For example, most people will not realise that in actuality, there is no distance, location, space and time. .. In another word, the world that we see is Holographic.... ( somewhat correspondes with the insight of Emptiness in Buddhism) . This is somewhat being hinted by the discovery of quantum science. Even if we are aware that the world is holographic, we are still locked  into the algorithm patterns of the particular dimension... this is somewhat liken to the karma patterns that helms conditions in place. Why so? the karmic conditons are is there, even if we have some kind of intermitten understanding and direct experience of Reality. For example, a human being can see in full colour.. a dog cannot. The conditions for such is the difference patterns of consciousness between the 2 species.</p>
              <p>Also, the world is changing... it is a good idea to have a back-to -basics attitude. .. like learning how to grow your own food and not be too reliant on technology, etc.</p>

              <p>Zero dimension probably meant 'the experience of Presence prior to manifestation/creation'. It can happen to meditators when their consciousness completely shut down.  When consciousness completely shut down.. it is not a blank. It is something that most have not experienced before... so i do not wish to put more concepts for people to imagine.</p>

              <p>How does these 3 'morbid' truths bring you to a luminous bliss ( if the conditions allow)...</p>
              <p>When you realise impermanence, the mind realise the 'hopelessness' of wishing for a glorious past and dreaming of a beautiful future. One need to be convinced that there is only change. With that, the mind and heart is willing to drop all expectation and abide as it is. This will lead to the experience of luminous bliss. Yes.. even when the eyes are wide open... perception will have a quality of dreamlike light/luminosity. This is how the truth of impermanence frees the mind of grasping for a 'better' alternatives other than THIS.</p>
              <p>Now... stay in this condition of allowing this to arise and pass away long enough... you may have the good fortune to realise another truth. The truth of no-self.  Here, you realise that this sense of self is like a passing cloud. An identification of 'me' pops out as a thought and then it is gone. There is no 'I'. When the grasping result/fold into an 'I' there is an I that suffers.</p>
              <p>Stay with this long enough and you may have the good fortune to realise another truth. The Truth of emptiness.  Well.. well... the universe is just a hologram of simultanous experiences occuring. There is not distance, space and time. Hmmm.. perhaps that is why some highly Enlightened persons have omniscience for there is no distance but all the experiences are interpenetrating.</p>

              <p>I have the following solutions for the so-called 2012 ascension. First of all,</p>
              <p>1. release your fear</p>
              <p> - negative entities (self serving states, institutions, people, and the likes) thrive on   fear. We are all fearful of death. But once you realise that you are a spirit being that animates this body that you currently have, you will no longer fear what is to come. You fear the physical body perishing in what calamities is to come, fear NOT! You spirit do not die. It's the physical death of the body. BUT, if you are VERY bound to the physicality and to the material world i.e. 3Dimension, you will be very very uncomfortable with death. i.e. you Fear death.</p>
              <p>Fear is highly entrapping. I.e. it traps your spirit to the physical world. The buddhists call this attachment. Release it and you will be free.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. forgive yourself</p>
              <p> - I have nothing much to say about this, but self blaming and self critism prevents your spirit from maturing. It's delimiting your own potential. You must realise that we are a very powerful being (i don't mean physically). But looking down on yourself, you prevent what is possible. Some religions out there (i will not name it) are pretty good at making us feel like shit. Don't buy into it... U are powerful and know you are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. forgive others</p>
              <p>- There are a lot of service-to-self humans out there. Your boss perhaps? Your colleagues and even your siblings or some of your so-called friends. Oh well... forgive them. I find the concept of karmic cycle logical in the sense that, upon our own physical death, if we have many "karma" with people of this life, we must return to "pay" back or be "paid-back" in that sense. So, for ascension or upliftment to be possible, we need to "detach" ourselves i.e. to forgive others. You must REALLY forgive them and no longer harbor any hatred, or ill feelings towards them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wish you guys, all the best, and may your spirit be free. Please help others if you are awaken and aware of this reality. Let your intuition guide you.</p>
              <p>We are all one consciousness, remember. :) </p>

              <p>It appears that there is still some confusion going around regarding the Dec 2012 event.</p>
              <p>As stated in my other topic, about the Dec 2012 event, it is<em> a
                                      phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, where the
                                      poles of our planet Earth are aligned (exactly at right angle) to
                                      a specific frequency generaterd by <a title="Quasars" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasars">Quasars</a>, which are large stellar bodies.</em></p>
              <p>This
               is a scientific fact from the field of Astrology/Astronomy, not a 
              made-up story. It is just like how people can mathematically calculate 
              when is the next eclipse. So for people who still thinks that "nothing 
              will happen" in Dec 2012, they will be in for big surprises.</p>
              <p>2012 is not the end of the world, but it is going to be the end of the current world's monetary/economy systems. <img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

              <p>To be true, I have already given a small picture (the one created 
                  with open office) to the readers in this topic regarding the expected 
                  human scenarios. The numbers are approximate values and not fixed 
                  because of free-will. For example, 3D humans can choose right now(2011) 
                  whether they want to ascend together with Earth to 4D OR choose to exit 
                  Earth and incarnate to other worlds more suitable for their 
                  soul-learning.</p>
              <p>Whether you believe me or not is not important to me, but I hope 
                  that you will start planning/making the most important decisions in your
                   life while you still can.</p>
              <p>If you choose to do nothing and carry on "business as usual", it means you have chosen the 3D scenario.</p>
              <p>If you lack scientific "prove"/data to make decision, I recommend you to read this webpage -&gt; <a title="http://www.timeline2012.net/prepare/possible-earth-events" href="http://www.timeline2012.net/prepare/possible-earth-events"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.timeline2012.net/prepare/possible-earth-events</span></a></p>
