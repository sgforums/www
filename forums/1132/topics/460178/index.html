              <p><br>To begin with, if you can keep an open mind of your own, read on. Else you'll have many issues with what I have to share next. :)</p>
              <p>Do the "sounds" you experienced come in the form of words or non-meaningful sounds? As Earth's vibrational frequency is rising rapidly currently, more and more people are starting to develop clairaudient abilities, so may find constant buzzing or weird non-meaningful sounds in their ears. It is due to the ears adjusting to receiving higher dimensional sounds in future, when they are ready. However, if the ringing/buzzing sounds are due to genuine ear infection, please see a doctor for medical treatment.</p>
              <p>If the "sounds" are in the form of meaningful words, just keep calm, ideally in a meditative state, be alone, feel within yourself, feel if the words make you feel positive or negative. If they make you feel negative, you can ask the source of the "words/sounds" to leave you alone. If they make you feel positive, it's up to your freewill what you intend to do with it. If you are calm enough on your own, without external influence from people telling you what to do, you'll intuitively know how to make the best of the message(s).</p>
