              <p>There is a Chinese Saying :"ç—…ä»Žå�£è¿›ï¼Œç¥¸ä»Žå�£å‡º". (Bing Cong  Kou Jing, Huo Cong Kou Chu).</p>
              <p><br> It means: Sickness Come from Eating Rubbish, Disaster Starts From Careless Talk.<br> <br> In the olden days, folks know how to speak carefully and to prevent offending anybody or any strangers.<br> <br> In this modern era, the Younger Folks,especially Singaporean Kids, going
               through Westernized thoughts and English Medium Education are told to 
              look down upon anything spiritual and to condemn such practice as 
              superstition. The worst are the Modernized Parents  
              and never warn their kids about the danger of being attack by Black 
              Magic.<br> <br> Modern Day Kids are trained to think "I Am God" - " I Know Everything" 
              type of behavior and go around mocking people as if they are the 
              greatest sent from god.<br> <br> With the advancement of Technology, people don't just communicate with 
              mouth to talk and paper to write. With Social Media such as Facebook , 
              Youtube , Twitter etc... one person can offend somebody or stranger or 
              the masses unknowingly at the speed of light. <br> <br> Many people think.. Getting Beating Up is the worst outcome for 
              bad-mouthing or teasing someone. but it is not. The person who beat up 
              someone will have to face the law and getting into jail. The most 
              dangerous revenge when You offended someone is...... You will know the 
              answer below.. <br> <br> The truth is...  When You Tease or Insult Someone whom You think is a 
              weakling.. may keep quiet and walk away.. but You will be in for a 
              Biggest Surprise later . You may not even know what has happened . When
