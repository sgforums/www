              <p>There are several Universal Laws, but I wish to bring to everyone's attention to an important one that affects people a great deal on a personal and obvious level - Law of Attraction. It affects love relationships and other people relationships.</p>
              <p>Many books have been written about this, so you can find out much information about it. However, I just wish to share some points from my daily work of helping people resolve their health and life issues, in the hope that it can help people make more sense of their lives.</p>
              <p>Universal Law of Attraction has a very wide and powerful scope, but I'll start off this thread with just a few sharings. This Law is always active and works automatically in the background of Earth's workings, and so affects everyone's life all the time.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Romantic Love:</span></strong><br>A topic close to most people's hearts. During the full life journey, many people would have experienced the emotional pain of unreciprocated love or broken relationships/marriages. Very often, the vibrational frequencies of the 2 people are either too different to begin with, or they were compatible in the beginning but differed too much along the way.</p>
              <p>That is why it is not possible to force a person to love another person and expect a happy lasting relationship, because if their frequencies are too different, they will automatically and subconsciously feel very strongly that the other person is not suitable for them and will want to find other more suitable person. As Earth's frequency is rising rapidly during her current transformation leading to Ascension, everyone's vibrational frequency is likely to change.</p>
              <p>When a couple's individual frequencies have changed at a different pace, they will naturally find that their mindset and feelings have become too different for them to stay together happily. That is the reason why it is getting more and more common for marriages and relationships to break up.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other People Relationships:<br></span></strong>Universal Law of Attraction also works all the time for other relationships between people that don't involve romantic love. That is the reason why there is a term of describing people who cannot get along or agree with each other as "not on the same wavelength". It is effectively describing the difference in people's vibrational frequency.</p>
              <p>This applies to all forms of people relationships: Parent-Child, Relative-Relative, Teacher-Student, Boss-Employee, Colleague-Colleague, Friend-Friend, Leader-Follower, Spiritual Teacher-Audience, Speaker-Audience, Author-Reader, Forum Contributor-Forum Reader, etc.</p>
              <p>Everyone's soul journey and background is different and unique, and so their vibrational frequencies are also different, but each person's frequency will be compatible with certain frequencies. It is not realistic and possible for a person's frequency to be compatible with everyone else. And that is why when someone tries to make everyone believe or agree with what he/she says, teaches or instructs, they will definitely fail eventually. They will naturally attract a certain number of people with compatible frequencies, but definitely not all people's.</p>
              <p>I'm sharing this to help people understand the complex underworkings of the relationships between people, so that everyone can honour their own uniqueness and frequencies and not force themselves to fit in with incompatible frequencies, as it will only end in negative situations eventually.</p>
              <p>At the same time, people are naturally attracting people of compatible frequencies, so as long as people continue to improve their state of mind and emotional state, their vibrational frequencies will continue to rise and attract equally positive people into their lives.</p>

              <p>From this current period onwards, it will become more and more obvious that people of compatible and similar frequencies naturally tune in to each other's frequencies and come together, either as lovers, friends, teachers, students, etc.</p>
              <p>But I need to caution that if we have a low vibrational frequency, and continue to have much negativity in us, we will automatically attract people with similar negative aspects into our social circles, as our frequencies are similar and compatible. That is why it's so important for people to want to clear their negative baggages and start living and thinking positively. Often, people's life issues involve problems with other people, and the reason is their own frequencies are attracting those "difficult people" into their social circles, by Universal Law of Attraction.</p>
              <p>When we are free of negativity, our vibrational frequencies will rise, and we will naturally attract people with compassion, kindness, openness, joy, happiness into our lives and social circles.</p>
              <p>We have the free will to choose what type of Life we have.</p>

              I read your message here. Its interesting. I know many westerners believe in this universal law of attraction. Most of them are from the new age faith. I just like to add another topic which is coherent to your subject matter on the abovementioned. Its call SYNCHRONICITY. Take a look at it and thanks for sharing.

              <p>Actually, this is all Universal information, not about Western or Eastern. We have entered a new World Age where more and more people are becoming open enough to see the Universe as One, and accept Universal values while still keeping their respective religions (if they choose to) and not treat each other as enemies, simply because of a difference in beliefs. All religions have a role to play in the Universe's Divine plan to help people learn to be more positive people as part of the evolution of mankind on Earth. There is no one religion that is meant to be supreme. At the same time, people don't need to have a religion in order to learn about spirituality to learn to be more positive people.</p>
              <p>There are many aspects of the Universe's workings that manage what goes on Earth and other planets. Synchronicity is of course another very interesting and fun aspect. :) It is grouped together with coincidences and magic, under the broad branch of "Destinies of Fate", which people have no control over, as it is managed by higher dimensional realms. The other broad branch is "Autonomous Realm of Fate", which manages the path that people have control over.</p>

              <p><br>Everyone will eventually get to learn about the various Universal Laws through personal experience (as life lessons) in their many lifetimes.</p>
              <p>Eg. many people need to learn Universal Law of Attraction by having to experience having one lover/spouse after another, but all of them are so similarly negative. Unless one changes his/her own frequency to be more positive, he/she will not be able to attract a positive partner or have a lasting relationship with a positive partner.</p>
              <p>Another Eg. many people need to learn Universal Law of Attraction by having to experience severe financial hardship in their lives. Ideally, people in such situations can learn that their constant thoughts, feelings and beliefs about having a lack of money is the root cause of their hardship, as they are subconsciously attracting the negative situations to them, and is not caused by external factors (most of the time).</p>
              <p>Alternatively, one can learn about the Universe by accessing their own Higher Consciousness which has infinite wisdom. For people who are not afraid to communicate with the Higher Realms, and have the ability to do so, they can also learn from the Higher Beings (Ascended Masters or Archangels) whose roles are to teach.</p>

              In other words, as someone who is always thinking negatively, they are attracting negative forces that causes their own miseries like being depressed and having no motivation to proceed further. I see your point here clearly. As most cases, they are following their desire to fail rather than to succeed. So to counter those negative forces from being in your thoughts or rather within your subconscious mind, you have to think positive thoughts which could and would help you to motivate your soul and succeed. I think most highly motivated person that understands the law of positive thinking would term this as self-motivation and many too would actually go further to enhance their self-motivation with the technique of visualization of the end result prior to the actual end result. Yes, it may be slightly different from what you may want to materialize in the real world but the important element here is that you can at least produce a result that is positive..yes.

              The super consciousness which is call the "I" within one self existence and within that subconscious is the key to all the mysteries of your lives from the past and your life as in the present. The thought forms which creates that identity of the higher self that you have mentioned here is your own place to search for the beings as you have mentioned as the Higher Beings the (Ascended Masters or Archangels) for guidance so to speak, I can understand you. If I may put in a layman term, these Ascended Masters or Archangels live within your own self existence or soul to be more accurate. They are your inner voice, your conscience and if I may....your angels, light workers or co-workers of 'God' and 'God's' Inspiration to us on earth plane so to speak.
               
              The Universal Law of Attraction is like those Instincts Law of Attraction within the animal kingdom too since most of the animals do have that law of attraction amongst their own species and man is consider as a mammal in an animal kingdom too. In the past perhaps millions ago, we have that instincts but somehow along the period of time man having found new ideas to advance in their lives have lost it.
               
              I came across many books pertaining to this aspect but most of the authors like Ruth Montgomery and Arthur Ford narrated that all that are or were going to happen in the new life on earth plane are or were preplanned or predestined by the said reincarnators themselves with the help of the Higher Being guidances to help them to learn and develop on earth plane while 'washing and cleaning' their past Karma. After their sojourned on earth ended they would be able to ascended to a higher realm. I feel that if this is the case, then the Universal Law of Attraction is part of the whole plan of your life while earth. May I say so here too that we are only bound to each other for good when we have reached a higher realm before the Reincarnation took place?
               
              There is a book which most New Ager religion would term as Akashic Book or The Book Of Life in the unseen realm. That book is the record of all your past lives and also the predestine life later when you reincarnated? Many other religions do mentioned about the existence of The Book of Life too but it is different in meaning for those religions that deny or reject the belief of Reincarnation and Karma.

              <p>I'm not sure if you're familiar with reincarnation, but technically, it's really the process where a person's soul enters a physical body to experience Life. The movie "Avatar" actually was helping people to understand that the physical body is really just an empty shell on its own. When our soul enters the body, that's when we can start living on whichever planet we're on, but our true essence or Soul or Higher Consciousness resides in the Higher Realms that has overall perspective and understanding, while the physical body (with Soul) has only a limited perspective and understanding.</p>
              <p>Yes, all of us have our individual Akashic Records stored in our own 'Book of Life'. It is a living record of all of our experiences and journeys. It is described in various manners by different cultures and religions, but effectively, it is the same thing. That is the reason why a person's deeds or thoughts cannot be hidden to the Universe. Even if a person appears and acts like a holy man, but behind the scenes, had done many terrible deeds which no person is aware of, the Universe automatically knows, and that information is forever kept. The Akashic Records are also used for healing purpose to help someone resolve past life issues.</p>

              <p>I saw the Book of life many years ago in a dream. It was meant to help me overcome my fear of war and death.</p>
              <p>In my previous physical incarnation, i was a european who participated in world war one as an infantry soldier.</p>
              <p>Many years ago (in this life) in a dream, I dreamt of meeting 2 guys who appears to be monks on a forest track. The guys gave me a big book. </p>
              <p>In the Book of Life, there were many images of life events. I flip to the page where there is a picture of 3 of us (monks and me) on the forest track seen from overhead view.</p>
              <p>2 weeks after the dream... I was on reservist in-camp training. There was a navigation/topo exercise. I was walking and come onto a forest track... instantly i recognise that this track was the one in the dream. At the moment, a knowing comes into me. It says... "You were dead before... where are you now?'.. Instantly, I understood that death was an illusion</p>

              Yes, I do. Having said that there are few questions that need to look at here. Many Westerner and I think some Easterner believers have about some ambigious questions about this reincarnation pertaining to the time of the soul reenters the human physcal bodies. 
              
              1. It is during the foetus state or much later?
              
              2. It is during the moment of birth?
              
              What is your opinion or view about these questions. Hope you can share with us here. 
              
              Then there are many Westerner and some Easterner believers of Reincarnation who believe that they do not and will never be reincarnated into animal bodies? As for majority of the Easterner believers of Reincarnation, they believe they could and will due to their Karmic debts?
              
              Now, the question here is if those Reincarnation believers that do not believe that they would not or will never be reincarnated into the animal physical bodies, then the increasing numbers of the human populations of the world does not equate to the numbers of the current human populations of the world like for instance, it used be only 6 billion now it is 7 billion I think. Where the new souls come from? Unless you include the animals, then somehow another it make sense. But then again, this is the question that people would ask you. Humans have souls but animals do not or the plant do not? And where the soul sit within the physical body. What is your answer for these questions.
              
              As for myself, I have a different view about this Reincarnation concept or theory. It is unlike the religious conventional belief inpertinence to Reincarnation. I think I need to look at it seriously before I see it is plausible and make a statement about it within SG Forums.

              I understand perfectly your point there. I hope when I ask you this question, I'm not offending you or others. Where is this Higher Realms location? The Tibetan Buddhists call it the 'Bardo.' This is like similar questions asked by many where is hell or heaven? And there are many who explained that the hell or heaven lies within your own mind or soul. What is your answer for these questions?

              Yes, I agree. You can lie to others but you cannot lie to yourself or your own conscience or your own soul. This Akashic Records or The Book Of Life, in my interpretation it is your Soul Life Review when you passed over. It would be a movie or film of all your human life while on earth plane. When you do hypnosis on regression of the soul, you can actually tap that Akashic Records within that individuals for healing purposes? Or maybe you should open a another topic within SG Forums and share it with us the technique.

              <p>I've answered most of your questions here in my thread on "Past Life Regression Through Higher Consciousness" (<a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1132/topics/460408">http://sgforums.com/forums/1132/topics/460408</a>), which is more relevant.</p>
              <p>On your last question, everyone has a soul contract which specifies the people we are supposed to come in contact with, the purpose of that connection, what we are supposed to learn and fulfill in the life, etc. Healing people and helping people with past life regression are among the things I'm supposed to do in this lifetime. Teaching people how to heal themselves and others is also part of my soul contract, but teaching people how to do past life regression is not, as far as I'm aware currently. :)</p>
              <p>There are many people who have been doing things that the Universe did not 'authorise' them to, ie. give them permission and blessings to do. Eg. many people are teaching spiritual stuff and promoting themselves as spiritual teachers/Masters for self benefits and because of Ego, when they have not reached the required soul advancement level to do so, and so are starting to or will be experiencing the consequences of their actions.</p>

              <p>Each of our vibrational frequencies are constantly attracting energies to us, whether they are negative or positive, depending on our own polarity. It is not easy for people in general to tell what is positive or negative vibrations as they are not visible, but it is easier to tell from the impact on one's emotions and even health over a period of time.</p>
              <p>If the outcome is that we feel more peaceful, blissful and carefree (ie. without feeling the need to control) towards a situation or person, and we feel as if our life is flowing with ease and calmness, whatever we are attracting into our lives are more likely to be positive. On the other hand, if we feel worried, scared, irritated, angry, frustrated or worse still, start to suffer worsening health, it is likely that we have been and are still attracting negative energies into our lives.</p>
              <p>May everyone start to attract positive energies, vibrations, people and situations into your life from Now onwards! :)</p>
