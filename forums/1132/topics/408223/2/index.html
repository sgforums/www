              <p>For all who are open:</p>
              <p>Find out what actually happened in those cases (beyond what is reported in mainstream media), as well as many others who are now locked up in jails all over the world for the things that they were accused of, and what actually happened to them, and the 'invisible' people behind. Find out how many people throughout history have been killed and murdered, past and present, for the truth they knew about this world and for crimes that were pinned on them, and what actually happened to them.</p>
              <p>In the coming years, the world will know who are the real controllers of Earth. 'Saints' and 'Devils' are all messed up in this tightly controlled illusionary world, till most people are not even aware they are following the directions of the Dark ones and their allies, and their masses of misguided souls. They have to maintain enough distractions to keep people busy to prevent them from raising their Consciousness enough to free themselves from their control.</p>
              <p>Everyone is born equipped spiritually to stand strong on his/her own, and be guided by his/her inner wisdom independently, but too many have been misled to give up their freedom and inner strength. All will be clear in the coming years, and it will be a very painful lesson for many, but many others will be awakened as a result.</p>
              <p>All who are not aligned with the Light will find their lives harder and harder to bear, to the extent of being totally unbearable. Some will change course to learn to walk the path of Light again, while others will learn the gravity of their choices in subsequent lifetimes.</p>
              <p>Like I said, there are a few proven ones all over the world who have the ability to get Universal information about any soul on Earth now. If Sylvia Browne is not the one for you, find another <strong>proven</strong> one whom you feel right about, to help verify the true Universal spiritual advancement of the ones you are currently entrusting your whole lifetime's existence on. Just ensure that the person is neutral and has no stake in the results, so that you have uncorrupted answers. Beneath the masks of many smiling and sweet-talking 'saints' are hearts empty of Light. </p>
              <p>Everyone is responsible for his/her own life choices and future; no one else can be blamed for our own ignorance, arrogance and complacency.</p>
              <p>May 2011: the clock is ticking... Be at peace soon. :)</p>

              <p><br>In the next few years, many shocking truths will be revealed, and many innocent people will be freed from jails, especially in the major countries, where a lot of "hanky panky" and covert operations have been happening to cover up their negative activities.</p>
              <p>Look at what happened to the founder of WikiLeaks, after he revealed the terrible truths behind US military operations. He suddenly was accused of rape! How very timely and convenient!</p>
              <p>The time has come for all the truths and covered-up terrible deeds in this world to be revealed, one by one, including those that happened hundreds and thousands of years ago. All the seemingly unrelated cover-ups all over the world throughout history, going back to ancient history, will be traced back to one main reason, which is the real significance of this unique lifetime, when we're going to experience a Change of Ages.</p>
              <p>If large numbers of people gain enough Consciousness to know how to finally leave this illusionary 3D realm permanently (instead of reincarnating endlessly in this world in infinite loops) in this lifetime, the Controllers of this world will lose much of their power, influence and 'workers'. Afterall, what use is a King's throne when there are few subjects left under him to carry out his every bidding and grow his treasury?</p>
              <p>The next few years are going to be either extremely exciting, joyous and uplifting, or extremely terrifying and emotionally traumatic for people, depending on which side of the fence they choose to be on. All that I've shared may sound incredibly unbelievable or even absurd now, but all will be revealed in next few years, by those tasked to gather tangible evidence to be explained to the world. Part of that important tangible evidence is now buried in Egypt, only to be accessible in 2012, when the Light on Earth has reached its peak.</p>
              <p>True Freedom will come to all who wish to be finally free and be willing to put in effort to obtain it; those who choose otherwise will continue to 'play the game' in their existing infinite loops.</p>

              <p>You have completely missed the point. Earth has not always been in 3D and has been in 5D before in the ancient past. Currently, the process for Earth to change from 3D to 5D, we called it Earth Ascension. REGARDLESS of what you believe/think, ready or not, Earth must ascend.</p>
              <p><em>"Earth will always be of higher dimension than humans,
                                              which is why majority of Earth humans are still in 3D form
                                              currently."<br><br></em>By the way, if you are really a Christian, you should be aware that during "Adam and Eve" time, human beings can live up to (1,000) thousand years old, not like our current life span of 60-90 years old at all. And also, its good to know who Lord Sananda is and what he has to say.</p>

              <p>Mother Earth (Lady Gaia) is an extremely advanced sentient being, not some lifeless chunk of rock and magma. We are all connected. Her level of Consciousness is far higher than anyone's on Earth right now. Her body is currently changing and healing itself, as part of her preparations for her Ascension, getting rid of built-up negative energy deep within her, which resulted because of people's pollution (with negative thought-forms, emotions and deeds) throughout history.</p>
              <p>She is now accumulating and directing all the negative energy deep within her, to certain parts of her body. Those parts of her body will experience the most severe human casualities in the coming months and years, though the rest of the world will also experience varying degrees of effects of the upcoming 'situations'.</p>
              <p>Many people around the world will finally be genuinely awakened as a result of future experiences, and will have many opportunities to finally open their minds and hearts to care for others unconditionally, instead of only caring for self or 'own tribes' only. All who have been paying only lip service about caring for others will show their true selfish selves during those 'situations'. Many will continue to stick to their 'own tribes' to watch each others' backs only, at the expense of others in greater need of help. There will be much learning for all. Universal Law of Cause and Effect will function to its greatest effect soon.</p>
              <p>All who are willing to use the future opportunities well to raise their level of Consciousness, and heal themselves completely of all attachments, fears and 'negative baggage' accumulated from present and all past lifetimes, will have the opportunity to Ascend with Earth in this lifetime. </p>

              <p>By this time next year, this will be crystal clear to all who are reading this now, and you will definitely remember this moment that you read about this. To expect the current 'calm before the storm' to continue forever, and plan one's future based on this current situation is not a wise move, eg. make huge purchases/investments that require future earnings (estimated based on current earning capacity) to pay up.

              <p>Use this calm period well to get rid of all your fears. When the 'storm' comes, all forms of fears still existing in people by then will be multiplied many-folds due to the scale and nature of unprecedented events/situations.</p>

              <p>It definitely is, but unfortunately, not enough people are aware, or are willing to learn from their karmic issues. Resolving karmic issues is not fun or easy, and so many people take the easy way out in previous lifetimes, ie. to choose life options that can avoid facing those issues.

              <p>Karmic resolution on a large scale for the world, which is one of the compulsory requirements for Earth Ascension, is only starting, but the effects will accelerate in the next couple of years.

Self-denial, Arrogance and Ignorance do not bring bliss in this case.</p>
              <p>The effects will be greatest for those who have accumulated too many outstanding karmic issues from past lives, and have yet to clear them. Many people will have strange illnesses which doctors have no logical explanation for, or are unable to diagnose correctly, and no medicines can treat, because they must be willing to learn from their karmic issues before they can recover.</p>
              <p>'<a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/11/unknown-and-strange-illnessesdiseases.html">Strange/Unknown illnesses</a>' is only one of the many unexplained strange/illogical situations that will be happening in people's lives from now on. The Universe does not operate the way people read about in mainstream texts.</p>
              <p>This lifetime, there is no more avoiding, no more hiding, unlike all previous lifetimes. This lifetime, everyone will face opportunities for them to clear all their outstanding major karmic issues. If all the major karmic issues can be resolved, minor ones can be "written off" by Universal Law of Grace, depending on each person's case.</p>

              <p>The only reason I have to specify my spiritual background in the Universe is to help those already awakened (according to the Universe, not by Earthly man-made definitions) or about to be awakened locate me, as already planned in their lifeplans, or guided to locate me by their Spirit Guides. For others, I would probably be more of an irritant than help to them, when they read my postings! hahah....</p>

              <p>The karmic acceleration has been happening for quite some time now.</p>
              <p>Regardless of whether it is planetary ascension period or not, for people on the later stage of spiritual development, the karmic cause and effect can happen very fast ... as in a matter of days or even hours. One will be able to see the cause and effect more clearly when the duration is not stretched across lifetimes.</p>
              <p>It is good to be as disciplined as possible.... so as not be caught in more unpleasant situations.</p>
              <p>Also, imo, there are 2 main types of karmic related issues.</p>
              <p>1. Of balancing or debt clearance. Understanding from the opposite pole.</p>
              <p>2. imprints from traumatic events happening in the past.</p>
              <p>Both type can produce manifestation in current life situation. Sometimes when the conditions occurs, the best that can be done is to live through it... with compassion. This is also a time to recognise the patterns/behaviour in ourself.</p>

              <p>The Ancients have many names for this phase of life on Earth, "End of Days", "End of Times", "Age of Purification", "Age of Cleansing", etc etc. But I'll just stick to "Change of Ages", as it's really about inevitable major changes, not end of the world. Though to a certain percentage of the world's population, understandably, they may feel like end of the world.</p>
              <p>This is the time to Free Our Minds, and not be distracted or misguided, into following ways that will prevent us from preparing ourselves for the post-changes. Naturally, people like to stay in familiar territorities, in all aspects of life, so will do everything possible to hang on to familiar grounds in order to feel secure. However, in these coming years, refusing to let go of familiar grounds will result in much greater hardship.</p>
              <p>Everyone needs to understand that the upcoming changes are long overdue, and are unavoidable this time round. We are moving on to a new phase of life where true peace, harmony and Oneness will be the way of life. The current 'engineered' state of world affairs and human relationships are actually the cause of this world's problems. Many 'structures and systems' are kept tightly in place to ensure that people can never get along with each other in genuine harmony, and will make way for the new way of life. These 'structures and systems' were maintained to influence/control how people live, think, behave, feel (especially fear), etc, effectively to create the reality of people.</p>
              <p>There are many groups all over the world now trying extremely hard to convince people that nothing major will happen, and that no preparations need to be made, no self healing is required, or are creating seemingly unrelated events/situations to distract people from finding out what is going to happen. Their reasons are to try to maintain control over their 'structures and systems' that have been serving their selfish needs well, at everyone else's expense, whom they have no genuine concern about, despite their appearances.</p>
              <p>Because people's lives are currently revolving around these 'structures and systems', the unprecedented changes that will happen to these 'structures and systems' will result in really difficult times for people for some time, besides the physical Earth changes and karmic issues I mentioned in earlier posts. If people are able to open their minds and hearts to understand the true reality (versus the currently engineered reality) and accept the major adjustments, they will be able to adapt to the new way of life and enjoy the post-changes, else life will continue to be tough or even hellish, in extreme cases.</p>
              <p>This is the time for everyone to take full responsibility for his/her own life and future, and make personal life decisions without influence from anyone else. Following the crowd without fully understanding the consequences could have grave outcomes, if the crowd happens to be 'marching off a cliff'.</p>

              <p>It's a time of much positive energy all around the world, even though the true history of this day is not what is widely claimed to be. While people are enjoying themselves partying, shopping, wining and dining during this festive period, it'll be great if everyone can spare some heart, time and effort to help people they know who are going through a hard time in their lives now. Though genuinely helping strangers would be wonderful, but guess that is one hurdle too high to cross for most people.</p>
              <p>This coming Christmas and New Year's Eve will be the last ones where people can party and splurge as before...</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/11/unknown-and-strange-illnessesdiseases.html">Unknown illnesses/diseases</a></span></strong></p>
              <p>I have been talking a fair bit about unknown and serious illness/diseases that more and more people all around the world  are currently getting, and that such unexplainable situations will intensify in the coming months to years. If you have not encountered this situation yet among the people you know, you may not fully understand the seriousness and rationale of this. But gradually, people will have experience with this, one way or another.</p>
              <p>The reason for this happening at this crucial period leading to Ascension is to help people in this world learn the the true meaning of Life. Much of this world holds the strong belief that money can buy everything in Life: happiness, love, health, etc. In fact, chasing after money and protecting money has become the main purpose of life for many people. Many relationships are currently being built on the basis of money, and not unconditional love.</p>
              <p>All this is in the process of changing. This world is learning that all the money cannot buy love, happiness, health and purpose of life. Currently, many people live their lives feeling invincible and invulnerable because of their wealth, thinking that with money, all of their health problems can be resolved, by seeking the most expensive doctors around the world. All this will come to an end soon.</p>
              <p>People need to realise and understand quickly that the purpose of life on Earth is to learn to be more compassionate, more positive and more genuine people through their various life experiences. As long as people refuse to accept this and start living more positive lives, they will encounter all sorts of unexplainable situations in their lives to help them understand this. Depending on each person's level of negativity and inner issues, the situations will be appropriately planned by the Universe and his/her Spirit Guides to help him/her to learn most effectively.</p>
              <p>A rather extreme example to illustrate how illness can help a person change for the better:</p>
              <p>A multi-millionaire enjoying the time of his life now with endless inflow of money, and lives extravagantly, mingling only with the rich and famous, looking down on the poor and nameless, ill-treating the other people in his life whom he deems as non-valuable to him, will never be able to learn to be a better and more compassionate person in this life, if he merely loses a part of his fortune, or even all his fortune. In such a situation, it may well be necessary for him to be struck with a serious and terminal illness that the best doctor in this world cannot treat.</p>
              <p>All his fortune would not be able to save his life and end his suffering. When a person like him becomes seriously ill and dying, his family members who were enjoying the fruits of his wealth previously would now deem him as a burden rather than asset. Families could break up because there was never any unconditional love energy in their relationships to begin with. Money was the only energy running through their lives.</p>
              <p>During this man's dying days, he will DEFINITELY have many thoughts and flashbacks of his entire life. His Spirit Guides will help him during this period by enabling him to think of the terrible person he had been throughout his life. If he finally realises his past mistakes, and is now willing to learn and be a better person from then on, the Universe and his Spirit Guides will then create amazing situations or lead him to assigned Healers of the Light to enable him to be healed (in his body, mind and heart) and recover, but the nature/pace of his recovery will be dependent on his sincerity to change himself to be a better person, and not revert to his old negative self upon recovery.</p>
              <p>Life lessons are not meant to make people suffer. Life lessons are meant to help people learn to be better people through their life experiences. Since most people hardly learn when they are having a good time, difficult situations would be required. But if genuine learning of the lesson is completed, miraculous recoveries and improvements can happen.</p>

              <p>I had previously mentioned on 12 Nov 10 about WikiLeaks' attempts to reveal the truth about this world. The top world news today (30 Nov 10) is about WikiLeaks' latest batch of release of many secret documents on the 'hidden businesses/relations' that US has with many countries around the world. It is causing a storm that will only continue to grow. Although this currently only seems to involve governmental, political and military matters, but in the coming months and years, much more details of the cover-ups in this world stretching from ancient history will be revealed, when the time is right.</p>
              <p>It will also be revealed along the way, who are the extraterrestrial groups who had provided US and some of the major countries highly advanced technologies in history, and how instead of using the technologies to benefit mankind, they have been turned to military uses to harm mankind. And how many of the influential groups in this world are all one "happy family" reporting to the same Dark masters, creating the endless problems on Earth, under many innocent, heroic and holy guises.</p>
              <p>To prevent the inevitable from happening is impossible. Dark-influenced groups need to understand that there are Higher Divine forces of Light supporting groups like WikiLeaks in revealing the ugly truth of this world, and so it is impossible to stop them, no matter what dirty tricks are employed, eg. false accusations, false arrests, reputation assassinations, life assassinations, etc.</p>
              <p>The foundations of all the Dark-influenced groups are in the process of being torn down one by one, to be replaced by Light-aligned frameworks, in preparation for Disclosure, First Contact and then finally Ascension. The transitional period will be tough going for the world, but the eventual outcome will be a joyous one. See through the Illusion of Earth soon, and the transitional period will be much easier to bear.</p>

              <p>Ha ha... Thanks for the sharing.</p>
              <p>This gives me the opportunity to discuss about ancient history.</p>
              <p>The history of pre-earth is very interesting too.</p>
              <p>In the ancient times, all is light. But over time, as patterns and 
                                  desires/karmas form over long periods, the luminousity of beingness is dimmed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a related side note...on the en<strong>light</strong>enment path, one will understand what is meant by light or luminousity. Real Light is not like what most new agers understood. Light is a property of existence... it can be experienced by people on an authentic spiritual path. Dark is not the the opposite of light. Darkness is the karmic patterns obscuring the luminousity/light. Dim or darkness is thus caused by and related to karma/desire/grasping and not understanding the nature of existence. Therefore it is corresponding to state of consciousness as well.</p>
              <p>Light has never been lost, it is just being conditioned by mind (by ignorance/karma/ego/desire) that prevents the clear seeing. To experience the luminousity, simply let go... really let go.. don't even care whether you are alive or not. When the ego-mind/self is deconstructed, one will experience the Light that is so bright that it is stunning! With constant letting go and not being conditioned by mind stories, the luminousity becames a regular experience :)</p>

              <p>The Universe is far more complex than what is often written about. Those who have lived <strong>enough</strong> <strong>significant lives (long before <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span> the religious texts on Earth have been written) </strong>on other worlds besides Earth will be able to explain this <strong>without bias or misinterpretation</strong>, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">provided</span></strong> they have been assigned to help with Earth's Ascension Plan.</p>
              <p>Only <strong>sufficiently evolved Beings of Light </strong>have been assigned to actively help with Earth's Ascension Plan. More of them are showing themselves all over the world now, but many are still waiting for the right time to do so, when the Earth changes are at their peak levels, and it's their turn to carry out their roles.</p>
              <p>Beware of Dark beings or Dark-influenced beings in disguise, no matter how holy or heroic they appear to be. Follow closely the activities <span style="text-decoration: underline;">behind the scenes</span> of spiritual/religious leaders/teachers to know their true selves and agendas. Following the wrong guidance will result in being stuck in more endless reincarnation cycles in a "dying" 3D world (but it will not be in 2012), even if people have the potential to Ascend to 5D New Earth in this lifetime.</p>
              <p>Earth is a relatively young planet, and it owes its beginning to many other extremely advanced <a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/09/extraterrestrial-friends-are-helping.html">extraterrestrial civilisations</a>. Many spiritual teachers (religious or New Age) on Earth now are really not evolved enough (at soul level) to help their students/people overcome the inevitable life changes, let alone guide them to <a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/07/line-of-evolution-is-being-drawn.html">evolve in this lifetime</a>. Nothing wrong with that since it all boils down to freewill of choice to follow these teachers, and every soul is at different stage of <a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/07/line-of-evolution-is-being-drawn.html">evolution</a>.</p>
              <p>Ascension is basically the <a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/07/line-of-evolution-is-being-drawn.html">evolution of Earth and human beings</a>. There are still many people walking this Earth now who have been stuck in the endless reincarnation cycles from eons ago because of the wrong life choices they keep making. Hope all readers who are guided to read this message will make the effort in 2011 to find out more about Ascension from as many sources as possible, and then use your intuition to realise what is the best path for you.  </p>
              <p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/12/creatorsourcegod-speaks-money-and.html">2011 is coming</a>. Going to be an extremely busy year for me. Don't foresee I'll have time to post often in the year ahead. For all readers: be <strong>extremely discerning </strong>about what you read or hear, open your minds and hearts, and live happily! Everyone has to take full responsibility for their lives and future in this lifetime.</p>
              <p>Take care to all! From <a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/12/creatorsourcegod-speaks-money-and.html">mid 2011 onwards will see many major events</a> leading to the climax in December 2012... :)</p>

              <p>Everybody will eventually die..no big deal about it. .What's the big fuss about this inevitable changes anyway.....we all have gone through certain amount of difficulties if not in this life... in the past lives... if one can remember them....</p>
              <p>And there is no big deal about people reincarnating from other realms also... ... many of them also can't deal with life here as their heavenly life was too comfortable and good. Trust me... i know quite a few of them.. Some people even say i came from the Pleiades ( as well as angelic realm) long long ago... No big deal anyway.</p>
