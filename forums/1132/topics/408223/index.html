              <p>Hi Rainbow Jigsaw, not that I want to bash you but seriously... if it is urgent, you should go straight to the point immediately, and not "beat around the bushes". Pay little attention to those people that questioned your integrity.<br><br><strong>Billions of human lives are at stake</strong>. You need to rally your friends and supporters and have some serious discussions.<br><br>Personally, I understand that you are here to support Earth Ascension to 5D... so<br><br>Please answer the following questions sincerely:<br><br>1. What are your mission objectives and how can we help you achieve your mission objectives?<br><br>2. If Earth is going to ascend to 5D, then certainly some humans will need to evolve into 5D too, am I right?<br><br>3. What are the minimum requirements for a 3D human to evolve to 5D being?<br><br>4. When are your space ships coming to fetch us off this world for safety? Should a Earthly 5D being also board the ships?<br><br>5. What is the refugee capacity of your space ship for Singapore and who decides who should go and who should stay back and rot.<br><br>6. The "elite rescue ships" refers to the Great White Brotherhood?<br><br>Also, I suggest you compile a document that is straight to the point, get SPH to print and put on the newspaper. Even if peope dont believe you, at least you have tried your best.</p>

              <p>Hi SoulDivine,</p>
              <p>It's heartening that you're beginning to understand the future, but there are right ways to do things, and there are ways that will backfire. That is the reason why although there are currently many people all over the world who have returned to help in Ascension, but it 'appears' to be still extremely quiet in the world now.</p>
              <p>Things are already happening in the world, if your intuition is sharp enough able to pick them out in world news. But next year onwards, definitely, it'll not be so 'quiet' anymore, and it'll be a totally different story. Life will be hard for people, but it will be for the good of everyone eventually. Hope you understand.</p>
              <p>For people who are ready and meant to understand in this lifetime, they will somehow be guided to my website, and understand somehow, like what happened for you. However, for people who are not yet ready to understand, they will just reject 100% of what I can share. It has to do with everyone's level of Consciousness, vibrational frequency, lifeplan and stage of soul evolution in the Universe. Everyone's path and lifeplan is unique. :)</p>
              <p>btw, please don't read my postings <strong>too literally</strong>, as you've misunderstood certain points, from my postings as well as other websites you've come across. And not all channeled messages and information that are found on the Internet are 100% correct, as some are written by malicious beings with intention to mislead, however genuine they seem.</p>
              <p>Often, I use metaphors and analogies, so that people who have developed and are able to use their intuition will be able to figure out. There's a good reason for it. It's like finding the right key to open a locked door, so that only 'authorised' people can enter, at the right time. :)</p>
              <p>Patience is a virtue. We need to allow things in the Universe to happen at the right time, then the outcome will be what is expected. Though it's ideal if more people know about Ascension and prepare for it asap, the Universe's waking up calls will still be needed eventually.</p>
              <p>Just to share: Ascension is an extremely complex process, and is not about 'ferrying' people around. hehe... And the upcoming Ascension process is totally different from the previous Ascension process, which only involved very few individuals who were ready. This time, it'll be done en-masse, and people will retain their physical bodies, though in a new 'upgraded' version.</p>
              <p>There are many things that people need to do about themselves and their lives to be ready for it this time round, eg. clearing their karmic issues, complete learning of key life lessons, getting rid of negativity, break free of 'negative programming', learn to see through the illusion of Earth, re-activate themselves and regain Consciousness, etc. It requires great effort and determination from people, and it can only be done when their hearts and minds are open, which is currently extremely difficult for most people. Which is why certain things need to happen to open people's hearts and minds.</p>
              <p>PS. I don't have a space ship, though I'll love to have one, someday. ;) Have no fear, my friend. You will be fine. Just continue to meditate regularly, and learn to develop all your senses, and sharpen your intuition, for the time being. Then you'll gradually be able to unlock more doors that you come across, and you'll intuitively know your way, without anyone telling you, even in the hardest of times.</p>

              <p>Opening one's mind to understand what is to happen, and opening one's heart to genuinely care and not just pay lip service, will make the difference in one's future ahead. Soon, it will no longer be about how much money one has or what job one has anymore that determines one's future. Not having an open mind will only result in fear and anger, when totally unexpected events happen one after another, while others who have understood will be able to take care of themselves during the painful times and rejoice when light shines once again.</p>

              <p><em>Feel free to read only if what I say resonates with you, and feels right with you deep inside:</em></p>
              <p>Take this time next half year to do all that you have always wanted to do, but have always been postponing, for whatever reasons. However, if what you've always dreamt of doing is to spend money on a new luxurious house or car, which you desire, but not need, I can only say that it will only end in regrets sometime in future, as the money could be used for more important necessities in future.</p>
              <p>Travel to places you've always wanted. See the world as it is now, as the world will not always remain the way it is now. Know more people in the world. Some of the foreigners whom you'll come in contact with in far reaches of this world could be people you're meant to meet in this lifetime, for various reasons, depending on your lifeplan.</p>
              <p>Spare some time to do more meaningful stuff, that will heal and open your heart. Life was never meant to be only about collecting material stuff, and caring about ourselves only.</p>
              <p>This is a crucial time of completing and resolving all loose ends of our lifeplans and karmic issues, and healing ourselves (physically, mentally, energetically and spiritually). If there are people whom you have always been having conflicts with, do consider how you can bring about a more peaceful situation and end to the conflicts, as continuing conflicts and tension do not serve you or the other party well.</p>
              <p>It's time to bring balance and peace into your life Now, and not be too attached and distracted by people and situations that don't serve your present and future well. It's time to truly feel joy and happiness for the goodness deep down inside you. External image and appearances of success and achievements will not matter soon, and will not make you feel happy and fulfilled in your life.</p>

              <p>It's good to have a daily meditation practice, even for a short 15 minutes, in a quiet place, eg. your bedroom. Meditation by itself did not originate from any religion (no matter what anyone or group claims), and is beneficial for everyone to connect with our true selves within, and be in balance within ourselves and the world around us.</p>
              <p>It'll be very beneficial to learn to bring ourselves to a point of peace and balance, at all times, no matter what chaos or upheavals are happening around us. Only then can we keep our minds clear, and detached from any external 'noise' and be able to make better decisions that can help overcome the chaotic situations. Getting sucked into external chaos, human dramas and emotional breakdowns will only deprive us of our mental strength to turn the situations around.</p>
              <p>Focus your mind on a good outcome, regardless how bad the current situation appears to be. Worry about a bad outcome happening will only result in making it actually happen. If the strength of your mind is not great enough, gather more people to exert the same mental focus on that same good outcome that all of you want.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, disasters would not be the most major problem. Attachments to money, material stuff, job security and comfort would affect the people much deeper than volcanic ash and flood waters. If people can understand and see through the illusion of money, then they will be able to take better care of themselves in future.</p>
              <p>Keeping calm in a stormy sea of chaos would not be easy for many people, who have been conditioned to react immediately all the time to non-stop 'urgent' emails/calls and bosses' screams, which really have no significant impact, in the higher scheme of things. Many people worry now about the most minute and unimportant matters. When real and truly significant problems occur, it'll be hell for many people to cope.</p>
              <p>People will get the opportunity to change mindsets very quickly in a very short period of time, by necessity.</p>

              <p>It's time for everyone to start thinking BIG, and dreaming BIG, assuming they do not cause harm to Earth and fellow people. It's time to start believing that we're far greater beings than what we've always been 'made and taught' to think and feel -- powerless humans and followers whose only purpose for living is to work and produce children for more workers, to keep the 'system' running, and believe/follow whatever the other members of the group/organisation are doing, as the group/organisation's objectives/beliefs are "always right".</p>
              <p>Increasingly, more people around the world are waking up to realise their true potential and abilities. Uncovered abilities will be greatly needed in future, to help themselves and people around them, when old beliefs and way of living cannot help them overcome future obstacles. That will be one of the key determining factors of who are truly ready to evolve further. People who are able to adapt to the upcoming changes and empower themselves by discovering their true selves within, will have the opportunity to break free of duality of Earth in this lifetime.</p>
              <p>Many of the problems in our daily life and in the world currently have been taken for granted to be part and parcel of life, to the extent that most people don't believe it's possible to lead happy and fulfilling lives. Fact is, these problems are the result of duality that is only present in our current 3D world, which was created to allow a world for people/souls to learn difficult/painful lessons of duality.</p>
              <p>Believe that you have the power within you to break free of duality forever, and open your hearts and minds to the fullest, and you can make it happen in this lifetime! It's all about personal choice and will. When your minds and hearts are in sync to break free of duality in this lifetime, you'll naturally be guided (by appropriate people and situations) to make it happen. This is the time to start knowing yourselves deep within, and not follow the crowd, if this is what you truly want your life to head towards.</p>

              <p>Space ship? 5D spaceship. Please don't believe everything... that people or alien tell you.</p>
              <p>3D cannot see and interact with 5D. How can 5D spaceship carry people?</p>
              <p>And also don't believe that the planet goes 5D at 2012. This is a misinformation. Sure there will be much changes but the vibrational change will be gradual ... very gradual. There will be much upheaval, but after that the restructuring will be slow and gradual.</p>
              <p>In terms of technology, my understanding is that electricity will be a thing of the past. There should be a new form of technology that is more compatible with the magnetic field of biological lifeforms.</p>
              <p>Also, don't confuse this ascension thingee with enlightenment... 4D-5D ascension still fall short of the realisations as taught by the Buddha.</p>
              <p>To give you a better perspective, the 'higher self/storehouse of memories' is a 6D frequency vibration which is finer than 5D. Buddhism's realisation goes beyond higher self  to encompasses the nature/properties of the universe. Read the dharma seal for a better understanding and to be authenticated. Whether 3D or 5D, etc, the universe always retain the dharma seal characteristics. What we think of as 3D never exist in the way that it is being percieved.</p>
              <p>3D is a perception, not a solid reality... for in truth, here and now, it is already devoid of space, time and distance. However, conditions (aka karma) patterns the perception to be physical. 3D is not a solid reality but a 'simultaneously experienced' holographic experience. Everything manifest timelessly (simultaneously) as a clear/luminous/interpenetrating holographic/overlaying awareness.</p>
              <p>BTW, i was born on christmas day with an inborn 'knowing' since young that major changes will occur beyond the year 2000.</p>
              <p>I apologise.. if i sounded blunt. Just wanted to be sure that the message get across clearly.</p>
              <p>BTW, Earth has been 4-5D before long long ago. Check out Lemuria which predates Atlantis. Also check out light-sound being (Buddhism's explanation for the origin of humans).</p>
              <p>Very importantly, learn to let go of negative emotions such as fear.</p>

              <p>Just doing my part. It is much easier for me to just be silent about it... but sometimes there is a necessity to say something and not for me to take the easy way out.</p>
              <p>BTW, my own 'knows' has been refuted many times by others and myself. ... keep it open for further discoveries. The 'know' is what is already in your store memories aka intuition.  Without breaking its own barrier, the know is alway stagnating at what it has already decided based on past deduction and interpretations stored in the subconscious memories.</p>
              <p>Without the past Buddhas challenging what is already known by sentient beings, breaking the cycle will be much much harder.</p>

              <p>Shall not turn this thread into another senseless thread debating (academically) one's attachment and passion over a belief system.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm glad there are increasing numbers of readers who understand the point of TS starting this thread, and can make sense of what has been shared, as they are among those who have the potential to evolve in this lifetime, whether they know it or not. Majority of those evolving in this lifetime will not be Ascending to the higher dimensions in 2012, but later on. There'll be a right time for all involved. Seriously, there are many, many, many preparations needed, so only those who are truly ready will be able to do so. But it will all be worth it. :)</p>
              <p>Just a bit of info for everyone who can understand: Earth will always be of higher dimension than humans, which is why majority of Earth humans are still in 3D form currently. Those who are ready and prepared to evolve in this lifetime, are already making the transformation to prepare for the higher dimensions (gradually for most cases, but can be quite dramatic for some), so are able to overcome the numerous limitations of 3D form, eg. cannot communicate with higher dimensions.</p>
              <p>As for whether people feel joy or fear, when the Shift happens, together with the accompanying changes on Earth, it really depends on the level of Consciousness that they have reached at that time. Level of Consciousness that can be reached by people, depends on how open their minds and hearts are, to understand what is to happen; and how much effort they have put in to restore their true selves, and release 'baggage' which don't serve their highest good, after being tainted by all forms of 3D negativity.</p>
              <p>It will be a very exciting time ahead, and I hope more people will look forward to the eventual joyful outcome, despite the period of difficult times; and seek personal freedom, happiness and fulfillment, instead of being caught up in the tug-of-wars that aim to capture/withhold minds.</p>

              <p>Hello People,</p>
              <p>If condition allows, don't hang around in the cities too much. Cities has a collective energy field that will pull one back into a 'conformist' thoughtform. It is a real energy field that can be felt if one is sensitive. This collective energy field will make it harder for one to overcome certain beliefs and patterns.</p>
              <p>If can, clear off as much electrical field as possible. One method is to take a bath. Walk bare footed on natural ground connect to the Earth and will ground off some of the electrical charges.</p>
              <p>If conditions doesn't allow, learn to let go and be OK with things :)</p>
              <p><em>If I am not wrong, transportation will be more problematic in the future. If you can, don't rely too much on personal vehicles.</em></p>

              My original first post is just some personal questions, the questions/answers still can be found on the second post. I changed it so that it is easier for the general public to read and know what is going on.
              
              About the Sun and Earth part, its a bit early to know the details. Mostly likely have to wait 2-3 years before we can get a better picture. For the time being, please read up more on world news as above and the Sun http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/.
               
              Some knowledge sharing about Astrology. 
              
              Do you know?
              
              That the Earth revolves around the Sun? 
              Each round around the Sun is called a year? 
              Does each new year feels and looks the same as the previous year?
              
              Do you know?
              
              That the Sun revolves around the galaxy?
              Each round around the galaxy is called a cycle?
              
              As the Sun is moving towards the end of a cycle moving into a new cycle, the energy it emits will be different. Since almost all the energy on Earth comes from the Sun, all the beings on Earth will certainly be affected by the changes in the Sun. All of us can feel the energy from the Sun, and when the Sun changes, we will naturally know that its time for us to change too.

              Hi,
              I believe we shdÂ keep an open heart/mind in the above mentioned. Just as Soul Divine mentioned, " we should treat information we received as either "I know" or "I do not know". " I am very much agree with him. Therefore, no argument will be involved as inÂ who's infoÂ is right or wrong.Â Haa. æ¯�ä¸ªäººå¿ƒä¸­éƒ½æœ‰ä¸€æŠŠå°ºï¼Œå¯¹ä¸Žä¸�å¯¹éƒ½ä¸�ä¸€ã€‚
              
              Anyway, if more than 3000 years ago, the names of Lord Buddha and Jesus were to mentioned to people that these Siants were to be borned in earthÂ a few hundred years or a few yearsÂ laterÂ to spread good teachings and help people, will these people believe it too? Hmm.....Â 
              
              Refer to website mentioned below, maybe you all guys might have different opinions based on whatever religions or teachings you all encountered. I do not have the powers of Lord Buddha, Jesus or accomplished spiritual teacher/monk, so I still think that it is best toÂ keep an open heart/mind to whatever info received.Â Just like people don't believe in ghost, must see ghost liao then will believe got ghost or don't believe in alien and space ship must see them liao then believe.Â Aiya, wait until 2012 then see for ourselves loh.Â HahahaÂ 
              I can only say we are not ALONE...

              Remote viewing Tibetan monks see Extra Terrestrial powers saving the World from destroying itself in 2012
              N.K. Subramanium, Special Correspondent
              December 26, 2004
              
              Remote viewing is nothing new in Tibetan monasteries. For thousands of years remote viewing in the middle of other spiritual activities have dominated Tibetan culture. What some Indian tourists came to learn from a few Tibetan monasteries under the current Chinese rule is extremely alarming and fascinating.
              According to these tourists remote viewers are seeing world powers in the course of self-destruction. They also see that the world will not be destroyed. Between now and 2012 the world super powers will continue to engage in regional wars. Terrorism and covert war will be the main problem. In world politics something will happen in and around 2010. At that time the world powers will threaten to destroy each other.Â 
              
              Between 2010 and 2012, the whole world will get polarized and prepare for the ultimate dooms day. Heavy political maneuvers and negotiations will take place with little progress.Â 
              
              In 2012, the world will start plunging into a total destructive nuclear war.
              
              And at that time something remarkable will happen, says, Buddhist monk of Tibet. Supernatural divine powers will intervene. The destiny of the world is not to self-destruct at this time.Â 
              
              Scientific interpretation of the monksâ€™ statements makes it evident that the Extra Terrestrial powers are watching us every step of the way. They will intervene in 2012 and save the world from self-destruction.Â 
              
              When asked about recent UFO sightings in India and China, the monks smiled and said the divine powers are watching us all. Mankind cannot and will not be allowed to alter the future to that great extent.Â 
              
              Every human being though their current acts in life called â€œKarmaâ€� can alter the future lives to some extent, but changing the destiny in that large extent will not be allowed to that great an extent.
              
              Monks also mentioned that beyond 2012 our current civilization would understand that the final frontier of science and technology is in area of spirituality and not material physics and chemistry. Beyond 2012, out technologies will take a different direction. People will learn the essence of spirituality, the relation between body and the soul, the reincarnation and the fact we are connected with each other are all part of â€œGodâ€�.
              
              In India and China UFO sightings have increased in many folds. Many say the Chinese and Indian Governments are being contacted by the Extra Terrestrials.
              In recent days most UFO activities have been seen in those countries who have indigenously developed Nuke capabilities.
              
              When asked if these extra-terrestrials will show up in reality in 2012, the answers remote viewers are giving is: they will reveal themselves in such a way that none of us scared. They will reveal themselves only if they have to. As our science and technology progresses, we are destined to see them and interact with them any way.
              
              According to the remote viewers, our earth is blessed and is being saved continuously from all kinds of hazards all the time that we are not even aware of. As our technologies progress we will realize how external forces saved us.

              <p>Though it often feels much easier and 'safer' to follow the crowd, as we've been conditioned to think that the majority is "always right", but the time has come to determine who are ready to evolve further, and who needs to continue to stay and learn in endless reincarnation cycles in a world of duality.</p>
              <p>People who are able to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">open their minds and hearts to the fullest</span></strong> will be able to overcome future obstacles far better than those who choose to cling on to "concepts and systems of illusionary duality". Many people all over the world who understand what is to come, are already preparing for the future ahead, so they would have no fear and be strong enough to help others in need, in future. The current world situation as it is will not remain for long.</p>

              <p>Hi,<br>I believe we shd keep an open heart/mind in the above mentioned. Just as Soul Divine mentioned, ” we should treat information we received as either “I know” or “I do not know”. ” I am very much agree with him. Therefore, no argument will be involved as in who’s info is right or wrong. Haa. æ¯�ä¸ªäººå¿ƒä¸­éƒ½æœ‰ä¸€æŠŠå°ºï¼Œå¯¹ä¸Žä¸�å¯¹éƒ½ä¸�ä¸€ã€‚</p>
              <p>Anyway, if more than 3000 years ago, the names of Lord Buddha and Jesus were to mentioned to people that these Siants were to be borned in earth a few hundred years or a few years later to spread good teachings and help people, will these people believe it too? Hmm….. </p>
              <p>Refer to website mentioned below, maybe you all guys might have different opinions based on whatever religions or teachings you all encountered. I do not have the powers of Lord Buddha, Jesus or accomplished spiritual teacher/monk, so I still think that it is best to keep an open heart/mind to whatever info received. Just like people don’t believe in ghost, must see ghost liao then will believe got ghost or don’t believe in alien and space ship must see them liao then believe. Aiya, wait until 2012 then see for ourselves loh. Hahaha <br>I can only say we are not <span>ALONE</span>…</p>

              <p>Remote viewing Tibetan monks see Extra Terrestrial powers saving the World from destroying itself in 2012<br>N.K. Subramanium, Special Correspondent<br>December 26, 2004</p>
              <p>Remote viewing is nothing new in Tibetan monasteries. For thousands of years remote viewing in the middle of other spiritual activities have dominated Tibetan culture. What some Indian tourists came to learn from a few Tibetan monasteries under the current Chinese rule is extremely alarming and fascinating.<br>According to these tourists remote viewers are seeing world powers in the course of self-destruction. They also see that the world will not be destroyed. Between now and 2012 the world super powers will continue to engage in regional wars. Terrorism and covert war will be the main problem. In world politics something will happen in and around 2010. At that time the world powers will threaten to destroy each other. </p>
              <p>Between 2010 and 2012, the whole world will get polarized and prepare for the ultimate dooms day. Heavy political maneuvers and negotiations will take place with little progress. </p>
              <p>In 2012, the world will start plunging into a total destructive nuclear war.</p>
              <p>And at that time something remarkable will happen, says, Buddhist monk of Tibet. Supernatural divine powers will intervene. The destiny of the world is not to self-destruct at this time. </p>
              <p>Scientific interpretation of the monks’ statements makes it evident that the Extra Terrestrial powers are watching us every step of the way. They will intervene in 2012 and save the world from self-destruction. </p>
              <p>When asked about recent <span>UFO</span> sightings in India and China, the monks smiled and said the divine powers are watching us all. Mankind cannot and will not be allowed to alter the future to that great extent. </p>
              <p>Every human being though their current acts in life called “Karma” can alter the future lives to some extent, but changing the destiny in that large extent will not be allowed to that great an extent.</p>
              <p>Monks also mentioned that beyond 2012 our current civilization would understand that the final frontier of science and technology is in area of spirituality and not material physics and chemistry. Beyond 2012, out technologies will take a different direction. People will learn the essence of spirituality, the relation between body and the soul, the reincarnation and the fact we are connected with each other are all part of “God”.</p>
              <p>In India and China <span>UFO</span> sightings have increased in many folds. Many say the Chinese and Indian Governments are being contacted by the Extra Terrestrials.<br>In recent days most <span>UFO</span> activities have been seen in those countries who have indigenously developed Nuke capabilities.</p>
              <p>When asked if these extra-terrestrials will show up in reality in 2012, the answers remote viewers are giving is: they will reveal themselves in such a way that none of us scared. They will reveal themselves only if they have to. As our science and technology progresses, we are destined to see them and interact with them any way.</p>
              <p>According to the remote viewers, our earth is blessed and is being saved continuously from all kinds of hazards all the time that we are not even aware of. As our technologies progress we will realize how external forces saved us.<br> </p>

              <p><em>Feel free to read the following for all who can <strong>keep an open mind</strong>, and understand that the Universe is far more complex than what most people are aware of:</em></p>
              <p>When 'First Contact' with extraterrestrials happen in the not-too-distant future:</p>
              <p>there will be segments of world population gripping with fear, as they have been completely in denial of the fact that humans are not the only species in the Universe;</p>
              <p>there will be segments of world population gripping with fear, as they have taught to believe that all extraterrestrials are evil beings;</p>
              <p>there will be segments of world population completely fascinated and awed by it, as it brings new excitement and distractions from life problems.</p>
              <p>However, the segment of world population, that truly understands the purpose of First Contact, is currently still small, but growing. There are many spiritually advanced souls all over the world who have already completed reincarnation cycles long ago, but are back here on Earth now to help with the complex process of Ascension, together with our extraterrestrial friends. It's a tremendously MASSIVE process, that when officially announced in the world, will blow most people's minds apart.</p>
              <p>People need to understand the fundamental reason behind 'First Contact', and choose their life direction wisely in this lifetime, as the consequences will continue beyond this current lifetime. Beings (both extraterrestrials and humans) who have been tasked to be here on Earth to help during this crucial period will all leave/Ascend once their missions are completed, leaving awakened Crystal and Rainbow souls to assist the remaining world population.</p>
              <p>Saving humans from disasters is not the main reason for 'First Contact', as mass extinctions have come and gone in Earth's history. Planetary Ascension of Earth is the fundamental reason. Human Ascension (for those who are ready) is part of the process. </p>

              <p>Events on Earth are accelerating, and will speed up much much more by middle of 2011. If you know who Lord Maitreya is, and can understand that many Higher Beings of the Light are currently providing guidance to help people on Earth now, you may be interested to read about his message on "<a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/10/maitreya-speaks-importance-of-healing.html">Importance of Healing</a>" ourselves (on all levels of our body, mind and soul) during this crucial period leading to Ascension.</p>
              <p>Help only comes to those who want to help themselves. Our lives and future are our own personal responsibilities; no one else can be blamed for our own ignorance, arrogance or complacency.</p>

              <p>If we wish to travel to an unknown place which can bring life or death situations, ideally we can be brave and confident enough to venture there ourselves, without anyone's guidance or directions.</p>
              <p>However, if we wish to engage a tour guide to lead/guide us, would we follow a tour guide who has never been to that foreign place before, or has an incomplete/incorrect map of the place, or worst still, has been lost every time he has tried to get to that place?</p>
              <p>But in real life, so many people all over the world are following guidance and directions from spiritual teachers/leaders/Masters/seniors who are lost in the <strong>Universal</strong> journey of Life themselves, even though on Earth now, they may appear very advanced and experienced. The Illusion (of Life on Earth) will come to an end soon, and Universal reality will kick in.</p>
              <p>In this extremely crucial lifetime when the Change of Ages will happen, if people are willing to risk/'bet' their entire lifetime's existence on the experience and knowledge of a couple of people, the least that people can do to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">help themselves</span></strong> is to verify the true level of spiritual advancement <strong>in the Universe</strong> (Earthly man-made titles mean nothing in the Universe) of their spiritual teachers/leaders/Masters/seniors. Verify also if the Universe finds these individuals ready and spiritually advanced enough to lead/guide people in this lifetime. Most importantly, verify if they are Beings of Light or are they of the Dark! So many Dark ones and their allies walk this Earth, with the masks of holy beings.</p>
              <p>There are some renowned and proven people all over the world who have such spiritual abilities because of their Universal life missions, to share Universal information to highlight the deception of man-made facts disguised as truths in order to control people's thinking. One of them is Sylvia Browne.</p>
              <p>Of the few who have the spiritual ability to get such Universal information, find someone who is a stranger to both you and the individual you wish to verify, and who is an unbiased and neutral person who has no interest or stake in the results, so that you have uncorrupted results that can help you make more informed choices. The results would be truly sobering and shocking for most people on Earth.</p>
