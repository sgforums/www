              <p>Hi Souldivine,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the sharing :)</p>
              <p>What you say is true. However, let me put it in a different perspective :)</p>
              <p>Hmmm... i dun really know how to put in word....</p>
              <p>The totality is experienced as individual streams of consciousness. The individuals can only work through personally. All beings can only work through their own experiences. The seeing of the 'huge issue' is therefore only a conceptual framework that must not be attached to ... this is because all beings will still have to work through the dynamics personally by themselves...</p>
              <p>That include the helpers and lightworkers too. The lightworkers must also be able to detached from seeing it as a huge issue. He/she must be able to establish equaminity state of being and not get addicted to seeing this as a huge issue.</p>
              <p>Perhaps later on the journey, you will understand that the stumbling block to the helpers and lightworkers effort is their own lack of mastery in taking things in a relaxed manner... in seeing that they can only 'transmit/communicate' but they cannot control any outcome. </p>
              <p>If you go far enough to reach non-dual level of realisation, you will see this to be true and that the real guidance is really one's own state of presence. We can only hint others towards their own true reality, we cannot save them. At this current stage, you do not yet realise what you really are and how what you really are is related to the rest of the world. Because of this lack of realisation, you think that you must help in the physical sense. However, the real help is in breaking the false assumption of being a limited being confined to and totally subjectable to the tyranny and wimps of darkness and nature. <em></em></p>
              <p>I hope you get what i am driving at. In my experience, the addiction to seeing this as huge issue IS also an issue that the lightworkers must themselve resolve... if they are going to impart the state to others themselves. The lightworkers must resolve their own angst, even in the area of their task.</p>
              <p>That is also the reason why i post a separate thread in response to this. The thread is here: <a href="/forums/1132/topics/418799">http://sgforums.com/forums/1132/topics/418799</a></p>

              <p>Several years ago, i got very pissed with my lack of ability to change someone that i know.</p>
              <p>In that night, I dreamt of Guan Yin. She said 'must have compassion for the person... she is what she is now due to the past life conditions that she had experienced'.. Next.. i was shown a scene of the past life of the person... At that point, i realised why the person is behaving like that... it was due to the fear of being put through pain again.</p>

              <p>As I have access to more information, I will/may carry on to provide
                  more information about life on Earth. And as I receive more
                  information, my mindset will continue to adjust itself to follow the
                  truth. But please take note that I am a free-thinker in this lifetime
                  and would like to avoid religious topics as much as possible for good
                  reasons.</p>
              <p>About a month ago, I used to think that the more people ascending the better, but this has changed...</p>
              <p>Currently, the estimated human population for Mass Ascension, between year 2012-2030 is:</p>
              <p>15-30 million (5D)<br> 1-2 billion (4D)<br> 4-5 billion (3D)</p>
              <p>As you can see, as of now, more than 55% of
                  the world population will not be ascending with Earth in this lifetime.
                  Those that are not going to make it will leave Earth and reincarnate on
                  other planets to carry on their life lessons...</p>
              <p>So you can
                  predict that at the year 2030, the Earth population will be reduce to
                  approximately 1-2 billion. Between 2012-2030, a lot people(4-5 billion)
                  will be "leaving".<br> <br> If you reading this now, I hope you can make a decision on whether you want to ascend or not, then prepare yourself.</p>

              <p>In case you are wondering what I meant by 3D, 4D or 5D. I will try to explain a bit.<br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Density and Dimension</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong>D</strong> refers to "Density"
              or "Dimension". Whenever we are discussing about specific vibration
              states, the word is "Density". When we are discussing about a realm of
              existence, the word is "Dimension". There are a total of 12 known
              density, from 1st density all the way to 12th density.</p>
              <p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3D</strong>ensity human</span>, you have that which is comprise
              of animalistic or the lower human attributes, including the part that
              is primarily preoccupied with procreation, sexual instincts, hunter
              instincts, survival instincts and e.tc. So, I believe all of you are
              very familiar with what a 3D human is like.</p>
              <p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4D</strong>ensity human</span>, you have the higher human
              attributes, the refined intellect : art, music, conscious awareness,
              imagination, creativity and what you call "psychic abilities". A 4D
              human is aware of itself as consciouness, as creative force, and it
              understands that its consciousness creates its perception of reality.
              Because 4D and 3D humans are smiliar, a 4D human will be able to
              interact with 3D humans as well as other 3D animals (dogs, cats, cows,
              goats etc).</p>
              <p>In <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5D</strong>ensity human</span>(aka etheric light body), you are
              effectively out of the wheel of reincarnation. You are able to maintain
              your light body indefinitely as you are no longer subject to the Law of
              decay/entropy of the lower dimensions. It is easier to move around as
              you no longer need to rely on mechanical vehicles to fly through the air or travel on the surface.
              As a 5D being, you will be able to interact with 4D beings. But in most
              cases, your communication with 3D beings will be limited due to 3D
              beings inability to perceive and comprehend 5D.</p>

              <p>If you are wondering why there will be such drastic/inevitable 
                                                  changes in the upcomming years, it has to do with Astrology, or Earth's 
                                                  evolutionary cycle.</p>
              <h3>The Precessional Alignment</h3>
              <p>At the completion of one cycle of twelve 
                                                  astrological ages, the cycle 
                                                  repeats itself. Astrological ages or precessional alignments occur because of a phenomenon known as the precession of the equinoxes, where the poles of our planet Earth are aligned (exactly at right angle) to a specific frequency generaterd
                                                   by <a title="Quasars" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasars">Quasars</a>, which are large stellar bodies.These
                                  energy emits by the quasars is known as "scalar electromagnetic
                                  impulses".</p>
              <p>One complete period of this precession is called a Platonic Year or a <strong>Precessional Cycle </strong>of <strong>about 25,920 years</strong>.</p>

              <p>At this period of time, the electromagnetic field fluctuates and changes
                                  in such a way that it creates a great deal of change on Earth. Our ancient Mayan civilization forseen this time of great change and recorded the event in their calendars, which is <strong>Friday</strong>, <strong>21 December 2012</strong> based on our Julian calendar. This precessional alignment event is
                                                   expected to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>last a few days</strong></span>, so I do suggest you keep yourself free for
                                                   these 5 days -&gt; <strong>19-23 Dec 2012</strong>.<br><br>During this period, Earth will go through an energy shift that accelerates the evolution of organisms present on her surface. As with the Galactic Shift, not all organisms will be able to make the shift successfully. Many will perish(leave their physical body) and incarnate on another planet, or incarnate back on Earth on a later time.<br><br>This is a wonderful 
                                                  opportunity for evolving souls such as you and me to experience this 
                                                  transformation and grow from it, if you are willing to accept and 
                                                  embrace the opportunity. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>

              <p>I've been saying lots of stuff since Jan 2010 on my website as well as in SGforum about what is to come during this period leading to Earth's Ascension. Some of them have already manifested in this physical world; the rest are still in the process of manifesting. A recent message that I posted in Jan 2011 was a channeled message from Archangel Michael (<a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2011/01/archangel-michael-speaks-feel-joy.html">http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2011/01/archangel-michael-speaks-feel-joy.html</a>) who had already warned: "End of next month onwards, life will be killing on Earth. That is like a lesson for all mankind. Be sure that this will have to happen." And so what happened in New Zealand, Japan and what will be happening are already expected to happen.</p>
              <p>Ditto for the Iceland volcanic eruption which wreaked havoc for people in Europe in Apr 2010, when I had already posted a channeled message from Lady Gaia aka Mother Earth (<a href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/04/earth-day-2010.html">http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/04/earth-day-2010.html</a>) 1 week before it happened, to tell people to stop polluting the air. To put Lady Gaia's point across to the world, Europe had to experience a period of volcanic ash in the air they breathe, as well as air traffic chaos. There are going to be many more intense 'natural disasters' and crises (of various forms) happening to get people to wake up, and realise all the negative consequences of their negative actions, beliefs and thoughts throughout history. </p>
              <p>In my older forum postings, I had talked often about upcoming and inevitable changes to many things on Earth these couple of years and beyond. However unbelievable they may seem now, they <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span></strong> happen. In fact, many of the "Man-created systems and organisations" are in the process of collapsing, as they are not of the Light, no matter what their public image may appear to be. It will take some time before Singapore feels the full impact, but it will be life-changing for all, when that time comes.</p>
              <p>It is going to be a tough year ahead, especially from second half of this year onwards. The earlier everyone learns and understands the true meaning of Life on Earth, the less painful will be the impact.</p>
              <p>With regards to the much talked about date, 21 Dec 2012, actually, the key date is really 20 Dec 2012, when something truly exciting is going to happen... :)</p>

              <p>What is the cause and effects of the "Sun changes"???</p>
              <p>Whereas the end/start of the <strong>Precessional Cycle</strong> is one of the causes of "Earth Changes", it is not the only cause. Earth's precessional alignment will only last a few days and has little effect on our Sun.</p>

              <h3>The Galactic Shift</h3>
              <p>There is a much larger and more significant astrological event that was left out of the discussion so far. As you should know by now, that as our Earth 
                                  revolves around the Sun, our entire solar system is also moving in 
                                  cycles around the Galactic Central. We named our galaxy the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Milky Way</span>" and at the centre of this Milky Way galaxy, the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Central Sun</span>".</p>
              <p>A <strong>Galactic Cycle</strong> is about <strong>216 million years</strong>, and the Galactic Shifts occurs twice per Galactic Cycle.</p>
              <p>Approximately every <strong>108 million years</strong>, our solar system (and other solar systems), pass through a band of intensified energy emanating from the Central Sun, known as the Galactic Shift. These bands of relatively non-polarized electromagnetic energy is commonly named as the "photon belt" or "electromagnetic null zone".</p>
              <p>The <strong>Galactic Shift</strong> affects our entire solar system, including 
                                  our Sun and the planets. The effects on the Sun, as we can see it, are changes in <a title="solar activities" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_activity">solar activities</a>: sunspots, solar flares, solar storms (solar winds).  Effects of solar activities on Earth include <a title="Aurora (astronomy)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_%28astronomy%29">auroras</a> at moderate to high latitudes, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the disruption of satellite comunications, radio communications and electrical power grid</strong></span>.</p>

              <p>The Galactic Shift has already started decades ago, and it is expected to last over a century (140+ years), <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ending after the year 2100</strong></span>. The energy emanating from the quasars that are aligned with the poles of Earth during the Precessional Alignment is relatively minor compared with the energy emanating from the Central Sun during the Galactic Shift. These bands of energy affecting our entire solar system <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>is increasing in intensity, will reach the peak around 2015 and will not subside significantly until the year 2035</strong></span>.</p>

                   It is unlikely I will be shocked/surprised by whatever information that
                   is going to be exposed and brought to light in the next few months.<br><br>1.
                   I know that the Pleiadies/Orions/Sirians have been moving in and out to
                   Earth since hundreds of thousand of years ago. The latest additions are
                   the the Zeta Reticulis. I myself incarnated in other worlds before I 
                  moved to Earth. And not to miss out, we also have the Martians from Mars
                   and the Venusians from Venus. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>
              <p>2.
                   I know that the Atlantis civilisation once existed on Earth and that 
                  the their technology back then is way more advanced than our existing 
                  technology. The Atlanteans developed radionics devices using crystals 
                  that were able able to generate all the energy they need for their 
                  entire civilisation. Unfortunately, one of their crystal generators 
                  exploded, sinking the continent and most of its inhabitants.<br> <br>3. I know that Earth's population have been controlled and 
                  manipulated by "Dark Forces" for thousands of years. Almost all the people on Earth
                   are slaves/fools working to serve the "Dark Forces". Their mind 
                  control programmes have been extremely effective so far, but once 
                  exposed and brought to light, it will collapse and fall apart rapidly.</p>
              <p>4.
                   I know that there is an "Inner Earth" and that the Agartha civilisation
                   share the same Earth together with us right now. Once the "Inner Earth"
                   and the "Outer Earth" are re-united, it shall feel like a joyous family
                   reunion.<br> <br> 5. I know what are the astrological events which are the "cause" of the 
                  inevitable changes on Earth and also aware of its "effects".<br><br>6. 
                  And most importantly, I know that Mother Earth is a spiritual entity and
                   she is ascending to a higher dimension. All the people on Earth will 
                  need to choose whether to ascend together with her OR exit Earth...</p>

              <p><br>My friend, the time is coming for the world to come together as One again, regardless of species, race, nationality, religion, etc. People have been intentionally kept separate and to turn against each other for eons over differences. There will be many major events to help people unite. It will not be easy for people, but hopefully, enough will understand their inter-connectedness with each other and Nature.</p>

              <p>Dear readers,</p>
                              <p>For your information, I have done lots of reading plus research for the past one year+ and made significant spiritual progress mainly through reading and healing. You can say that my <a title="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/" href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/"><em>Rainbow Jigsaw of Life</em></a> is becoming more and more complete and everything that I have learned about the<em> Nature of Creation</em>,<em> History of Earth</em>, <em>ET factions on Earth</em>, the <em>Dynamics of Soul Evolution</em>, the <em>DNA and Ascension</em>, the <em>Precessional Alignment</em>, the <em>Galactic Shift</em>, all make perfect sense to me.<br><br>The path to enlightment and the path to ascension is essentially the 
                              same as both will get you out of the wheel of reincarnation. The special
                               scenario for the upcoming mass ascension is that it is optional and not compuslory to go through physical death again, and groups of souls are likely ascend together in 2012, 2017 &amp; 2030. Souls that are ready to 
                              ascend to 5D can mutate their 4D human bodies gradually (takes approx. 20~30 years on average) into
                               5D etheric crystal light body without discarding the phyiscal body. For example, if your soul is ready for ascension in this lifetime and you have triggered your ascension template in 2010, you are likely to ascend to 5D at year 2030 and not 2012.</p>
                              <p>Now, this bring to us another big question mark -&gt; How can an enlightened/ascending human survive another 20 or 30 years on Earth while experiencing extreme harsh weather conditions and also surrounded by very negative people <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"><br><br>The answer is -&gt; Creating self-sufficient spiritual enlightened communities</p>

              <p>To kengkia,</p>
              <p>No one can join now ... because currently(as of October 2011) there is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> none in this region</span>. We <span style="text-decoration: underline;">need to start planning, gather people and resources to create enlighten communities first before we can join one.</span><br><br>The
                                               first batch of spiritually enlightened communities are likely to roll 
                                              out in North America since they have the smart &amp; wise people, 
                                              resources and technology to create them. If you take a look at this 
                                              webpage "<a title="http://www.timeline2012.net/index.php/en/prepare" href="http://www.timeline2012.net/index.php/en/prepare">http://www.timeline2012.net/index.php/en/prepare</a>", you can sense that they are already far ahead of us in terms of physical preparations.<br><br>Now, lets fast foward a few years (2013~2014), assuming the enlightened communites are already created, so the question is:</p>
              <h3>Can people wishing to be enlightened spiritually, join those communities?"</h3>
              <p>After the precessional alignment in December 2012, spiritually 
                                              enlightened communities are in the 4th Dimension (4D). All people who 
                                              are on the path to enlightenment/ascension can/will certainly join these
                                               communites as they are the 4th Density (4D) humans that will inherit 
                                              Earth. If a 4D human unfortunately dies before joining one of these 
                                              communities, their souls will choose to incarnate back to Earth at a 
                                              later date, as a 4D baby with loving 4D parents living in spiritually 
                                              enlightened community. However, in that case, their 
                                              enlightenment/ascension will be delayed by at least one lifetime.</p>
              <p>FYI, 3D humans are unable join 4D communities due to their low level 
                                              of vibration (very negative emotions, core negative beliefs e.t.c). 
                                              There will be spiritual protection/invisibilliy features in place to 
                                              protect 4D communities from 3D humans. You may call this protection "<strong>positively-oriented quantum field</strong>".</p>
              <hr>
              <p>If anyone wish to discuss further regarding creating a new community, please create a new thread in this forum, titled "Creating a 
                                              Self-sufficient Spiritually Enlightened Community" and I shall response. 
                                              This thread should focus more regarding Earth &amp; Ascension.</p>
