              <p>The highly popular Chinese drama, Scarlet Heart, <span lang="zh-Hans">æ­¥æ­¥æƒŠå¿ƒ,</span>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_Heart">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_Heart</a>) is very special to me, which touches deep within my soul. For non-Chinese, after you've watched the series with English subtitles, you'll understand my message here as well. It is very special to me, because it is about how the main character remembered her past life experiences with her lover, and all the extreme struggles and emotional pain that they had gone through together yet were unable to enjoy lasting love together due to her premature death in that past life. The other aspect of the story that is personally special to me, which I'm not elaborating here, is about how the main character knew about events that were going to happen in the future, but because the rest of the people were not ready to understand that it is possible for a person to know the future, the inevitable tragedies could not be stopped.</p>
              <p>It is finally coming to December 2012; it is time for everyone to connect with one's Soul and have the courage to speak one's Heart. I remember much details of many of my significant past lives, and almost an entire past lifetime of a very special and heartbreaking one with someone in my current life. I'm also helping people to remember their past lives to help them resolve their current life issues as well as to remember their soul, cherish their lives more and live more purposefully.</p>
              <p>In our modern era, many marriages and relationships are unable to last a whole lifetime over common things like: lack of time/energy to listen to each other's daily complaints about work or family or money, expectations not met over one's job or salary or status or appearance, lack of commitment in caring and taking care of family and children. If everyone can remember their past life experiences with their current spouse or bf/gf, they will cherish their marriage/relationship much more deeply. During past eras, it is very common for people truly and deeply in love to experience so much genuine hardship and struggles together but were unable to stay together eventually due to famine, plagues, wars, family/clan objections over religious differences, natural disasters, and even cases like a rich man or royalty bought the lady by force to be his mistress/concubine.</p>
              <p>While I can't expect everyone to believe or understand the unusual and uncommon things that I share about Life, I truly hope that for those of you who do, my words can somehow reach your soul. This unique lifetime will test one's Unconditional Love to the limits in the future ahead, and if one's marriage or relationship is built on very superficial foundations, the eventual collapse can be very painful emotionally. To truly Love someone Unconditionally, start by feeling each other's Soul deep within. :)</p>

              <p><br>In our modern era, many people are not connected to their soul, and only think and live using their conscious mind. That part of us is only concerned about personal survival and protection. That is why in many modern relationships that fail, the reasons are often due to 'surface matters' such as lack of money, job security, good looks, high status, etc. The natural survival instincts of people are to find a partner who can offer the most benefits to provide the best possible life.</p>
              <p>When one is connected to his/her soul, they will be feeling genuine unconditional love for each other, regardless of what challenges exist in their relationship.</p>
              <p>To connect with and feel one's soul, we need to truly live from our heart, not with our mind. The conscious mind has a 'built-in logic/program' that will automatically think of how to gain the most benefits for ourselves at all times. If we're still a hunter or farmer, that sort of thinking might be useful. But when we use that mode in our relationships, it is very hard for our relationships to last, and will be unable to stand the test of time and life challenges.</p>
              <p>When things go badly, eg. husband lose his job, husband lost his legs in an accident, husband is stuck in low-paying job while other men are doing better and better, wife suddenly has cancer, wife put on lots of weight after childbirth so is no longer pretty as before, etc, that is when many people's conscious mind start prompting them that they are no longer receiving sufficient benefits, and causing a problem for themselves, so it is time to move on to greener pastures.</p>
              <p>If everyone can start learning to manage their conscious mind, so that it does not attempt to control every aspect of their lives, it will really change their lives for the better. We all need our conscious mind for things like work or studies, but when it comes to matters of the heart, we need to make the effort to use our soul to feel, not our conscious mind to think.</p>
              <p>By regularly quieting our conscious mind when it is not needed through simple breath meditation or quiet self-reflection will help train our conscious mind to relax and stop its auto-controlling mechanism. When our mind is at its quietest, that is when we can connect to our soul, our true essence, the part of us that truly understands Unconditional Love. :)</p>
