              <p>As Earth's vibrational frequency continues to rise rapidly, more and more people will suddenly wake up and feel that they want to know more deeply about their lives, their past lives and the meaning of their lives. Many people who previously did not believe in past lives may one day feel the truth about reincarnation and people going through many lifetimes.</p>
              <p>While it is not a need for everyone to know their past lives, but when people have a strong curiosity to know their past lives or are stuck in difficult/strange life problems, it is often their Soul (Higher Consciousness) trying to let them know that there is information that they need to know from their past lives or issues that they need to heal/resolve in their past lives in order to fully resolve their current life issues.</p>
              <p>Many people are caught in endless loops or downward spiralling loops lifetime after lifetime, facing the same problem over and over again, because they have been failing to learn what is needed and resolve the problem positively.</p>
              <p>There are couples who have been spouses for many lifetimes, and in each lifetime, they are always fighting and quarrelling and suffer loveless and unhappy marriages. As long as they cannot learn what they are required to learn, they may well continue to suffer the same fate in future lifetimes.</p>
              <p>There are enemies who simply cannot get along with each other and in every lifetime together, they are always in situations where they face each other very often and continue their quarrels and fights and other serious conflicts. They could be siblings, parent-child, lovers, colleagues, friends, pure enemies, etc, in each of those lifetimes. As long as they fail to learn to resolve the problem between them positively, they can be quite sure to meet again in future lifetimes.</p>
              <p>People having consistent problems with their career, love life, family life, financial matters, people relations, emotional state, mental state, etc, may simply be stuck in past life patterns that have yet to be resolved.</p>
              <p>Earth is effectively a School for Soul Learning in the 3rd dimension, where both positive and negative forces/energies are present, and everyone is given the free will to choose how to lead their lives. With this much freedom, people can either grow spiritually very fast and advance/Ascend to the higher dimensions, ie. 'graduate' from Earth School, or be stuck in Earth School for endless lifetimes because they are not able to learn certain critical life lessons and break past life patterns/problems.</p>
              <p>For people struggling to resolve difficult life issues caused by past life patterns, unless they are finally able to Access their Higher Consciousness themselves (through meditation) and realise what they need to do to resolve their life issues, often, the only other feasible option is to understand and resolve theirÂ current life issues by Past Life Regression Through Higher Consciousness.</p>
              <p>What are "past life patterns"? They behave like auto-pilot programs that steer a person onto a path where a certain unresoved past life issue will again occur in their current life. This is done so that people have the opportunity to either resolve that issue or fail it again in their current life. If they fail to resolve that issue again in their current life, that issue will most probably be carried forward to their future lifetime with greater severity.</p>
              <p>The Universe often increases the severity of unresolved issues with each lifetime that a person fails to learn and resolve it. This is done to provide additional "motivational force" to a person to stop his/her past life pattern, learn from the issue, and choose the most positive option to resolve the issue.</p>
              <p>Life on Earth does not have to be about suffering and hardship, but our personal choices can either end that suffering/hardship in our current life or continue to cause such suffering/hardship to follow us through subsequent lifetimes.</p>

              <p>Can you elaborate more on learning and how to resolve the unresolved issues with our enemies in our past lives? Most people will just avoid being with people they can't get along with, it's that resolving and what are we supposed to learn ? For example, can't get along with your spouse, many will choose to divorce, can't get along with colleagues or bosses, just quit our jobs. It's that resolving by avoiding them?</p>

              <p><br>Everyone's life is unique, so I cannot generalise. Sometimes, on the surface, 2 different people's problems may seem to be the same, but the root causes in their past lives can be totally different. When I bring people to access their past lives, they often are amazed and sometimes amused by the Universe's 'logic' in structuring their lifetimes and life lessons.</p>
              <p>The Universe's 'logic' is often totally different from the logic that we are all so used to on Earth. That is why when people use purely human logicÂ and perspective to explain how the Universe works and how the higher dimensions operate, it is not accurate, and can cause more problems.</p>
              <p>Back to your question, there are oftenÂ several possible options to react to a lifeÂ issue/problem, ranging from totally negative to totally positive. Of course, it's not alwaysÂ feasible at the point of time to choose the most positive option. For eg. if a married couple's relationship has already reached the stage where serious physical abuse takes place, the most positive option where the couple forgives each other and turns their terrible relationship to a loving one is extremely hard to achieve. Then the next most positive option may be to divorce and go separate ways, and stop the physical abuse from continuing.</p>
              <p>But again, I must highlight that every case is unique, so the resolution must really depend on each person's past life patterns, life lessonsÂ and current life situations. It is not sufficient to look at issues and situations from the surface alone.</p>

              <p><br>The reason why I'm sharing the various info is to prepare people for what is currently happening or will be happening.Â  More andÂ  more people are starting to experienceÂ very strangeÂ situations in their lives, either in their health, physical bodies,Â emotional state, mental state, relationships, families, careers, etc, without understanding the reason for the sudden changes. If people can be open enough to at least give some thought to what I've been sharing, and take some time to find out more about it, instead of totally rejecting it, it will help everyone to a certain extent.</p>
              <p>Regarding your questions, I consider myself a Universal Being, with no religion. I don't wish to talk more about myself here, because the focus is on the info IÂ need to share at this time of Earth changes, not me. :) Â </p>
              <p>Names and labels are very important to people here on Earth, but in the higher dimensions, names are really not important at all. I use the word Higher Realms loosely here, but the respective religions would have names for it. As long as it makes sense to people, whatever name you call it doesn't matter. "<em>What's in a name? that which we call a rose, By any other name would smell as sweet</em>". ;)</p>
              <p>More important than what name to call the afterlife, people need to understand that how they lead their lives and what life options they make at every moment of their lives now have consequences far beyond their death at the end of each lifetime.</p>
              <p>On a positive note, people who consistently live positively every lifetime and grow spiritually with each lifetime will eventually be able to 'graduate' from this Earth School and move on to the higher dimensions where the level of negativity is far less than what is here on Earth. There will still be challenges to face, but the type of problems will no longer be like those that people on Earth suffer daily from. In the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">positive</span> higher dimensions, the life purpose of each Being is mostly to do with helping others and planets in the lower dimensions, such as Earth.</p>

              I understand what you mean and it is another alternative for them to understand the source of their miseries. In Singapore, this alternative that you are introducing has yet to be accepted by many because they are not familiar with it and they have their own religious precepts to adhere. I think many too see this teaching of yours like an occult doctrines and they are very cautious about it I guess though you may have quite a number of people who have believed you. You have to be very patient.

              I understand. I see myself as only a man with universal belief. I consider myself as non-comformist to any religion though my name is a Muslim name.

              <p>I need to highlight that I'm not here to teach anything, but simply to share, because everyone actually has all the wisdom within themselves, if they can be 'quietÂ enough' to listen to their Soul (Higher Consciousness). :)</p>
              <p>In this unique lifetime of Earth Ascension, people who are ready to be MastersÂ of their own lives will be able to connect with their own Higher Consciousness, gain the necessary knowledge and wisdom, and 'graduate' from Earth realm, provided they have cleared all their negative karma and Let Go of all negative baggages from all lifetimes.</p>
              <p>A certain percentage ofÂ people on Earth would have had lives on other planets. When I regress people to their past lives, sometimes they may see their time on other worlds and are pretty amazed to know they had Silver or Blue skin, orÂ had abilities that are considered supernatural on Earth.Â :) Of course, there are many planets with humanoid forms, like Earth.</p>
              <p>Yes, Beings from other planets do reincarnate on Earth occasionally. The most common reason is to grow spiritually faster, due to the numerous opportunities for very tough life experiences, as Earth has the unique qualities of having free will, so people on Earth have lots of freedom to choose their life options.</p>
              <p>IÂ won't touch uponÂ the presence and roles of Beings from other planets who had reincarnated on Earth in ancient history, as it is extremely complex and involves many aspects. That informationÂ will be made public in the coming years, and can be considered pretty sensitive.</p>
              <p>Currently, the other less common reason for Beings from other planets reincarnating on Earth is to experience Earth Ascension and/or helping with the process. Most of them, by now, should already have remembered their life mission details, connected with their Higher Consciousness in one way or another, and are working on their required roles. There are unfortunately many who have gotten really lost and have totally forgotten their roles, ever since they reincarnated on Earth. Through my work, I'm helping such Beings to regain their lost memories and start working on their roles, if they wish.</p>
              <p>The last bit of info that I just shared about Beings from other worlds already here on Earth may sound fictional and unbelievable to some of you. But from end of this year onwards, many major events and situations will be happening, so it will be much easier for everyone to understand the exciting future of Earth. :)</p>

Astral travelling to other worlds and planets is something I enjoy, though being physically there would be even better!

              Like listening to the inner voice. Is that your own conscience talking to yourself or the Ascended Masters or Angels so to speak? They say that we only use about 20% of our mind while we are awake that is your conscious and the other 70% lies within your subconscious mind, which is always awake and controls all your oblivious movements that are hidden and seen, unlike the conscious mind, it sleeps when we are asleep.

              <p>Yes, I do. Having said that there are few questions that need to look at here. Many Westerner and I think some Easterner believers have about some ambigious questions about this reincarnation pertaining to the time of the soul reenters the human physcal bodies.</p>
              <p>1. It is during the foetus state or much later?</p>
              <p>2. It is during the moment of birth?</p>
              <p>What is your opinion or view about these questions. Hope you can share with us here.</p>
              <p>Then there are many Westerner and some Easterner believers of Reincarnation who believe that they do not and will never be reincarnated into animal bodies? As for majority of the Easterner believers of Reincarnation, they believe they could and will due to their Karmic debts?</p>
              <p>Now, the question here is if those Reincarnation believers that do not believe that they would not or will never be reincarnated into the animal physical bodies, then the increasing numbers of the human populations of the world does not equate to the numbers of the current human populations of the world like for instance, it used be only 6 billion now it is 7 billion I think. Where the new souls come from? Unless you include the animals, then somehow another it make sense. But then again, this is the question that people would ask you. Humans have souls but animals do not or the plant do not? And where the soul sit within the physical body. What is your answer for these questions.</p>
              <p>As for myself, I have a different view about this Reincarnation concept or theory. It is unlike the religious conventional belief inpertinence to Reincarnation. I think I need to look at it seriously before I see it is plausible and make a statement about it within SG Forums.</p>
              <p>LLU wrote:<br>âThe movie âAvatarâ actually was helping people to understand that the physical body is really just an empty shell on its own. When our soul enters the body, thatâs when we can start living on whichever planet weâre on, but our true essence or Soul or Higher Consciousness resides in the Higher Realms that has overall perspective and understanding, while the physical body (with Soul) has only a limited perspective and understanding.â</p>
              <p>I understand perfectly your point there. I hope when I ask you this question, Iâm not offending you or others. Where is this Higher Realms location? The Tibetan Buddhists call it the âBardo.â This is like similar questions asked by many where is hell or heaven? And there are many who explained that the hell or heaven lies within your own mind or soul. What is your answer for these questions?</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p><br>The soul can only enter or integrate with a physical body that has the necessary brain 'circuitry' ready, so generally, a soul of a baby can start to enter a foetus after the 3rd month. But the soul of the baby can decide whether he/she wishes to stay with this body up till the moment of birth. If the soul is relatively young in its Universal existence, ie. hasn't got much experience with physical lives of much negativity, if its soul plan is very tough or its mother and its new family will give it a very negative environment to grow up in, it may not have the confidence to go through with the whole process of its reincarnation into this baby's body.</p>
              <p>Hence, the soul may either give up its place to another soul to take its place, or if no soul wishes to take its place, the foetus will end up as a still-born. That is why I often urge women who are having rocky marriages to think carefully before having a child, as it may end in regrets later. It would have a far more positive outcome for couples to have a positive marriage relationship before having children. Very often, couples having problems in their marriage think that having a baby will solve their existing marriage problems.Â  But I need to highlight that not all still-born cases are of this nature, though it's common.</p>
              <p>On the item on number of souls available for reincarnation, I need to say that All-That-Is (also known as God, Source, Prime Creator, Ultimate Consciousness etc) which provides the energy for the creation of Universes and Multiverses is really infinite. The common perspective of people on Earth is that everything is limited, so everyone must fight for his/her share of a certain resource. While soul energy can be re-absorbed by Source to be re-cycled, new souls are always created, somewhere out there. Earth is just one bit of an infinite 'space' in Consciousness. :)</p>
              <p>On your last point of Heaven and Hell, a very popular question. Instead of giving my input directly, I would like to ask "If Heaven is in place X1, and Hell is in place X2, and Higher Realms is in place X3, how does the information of the values of X1, X2 and X3 help anyone's spiritual growth? " :) During my regression work, I often bring people to their Death Point of their past lives, so that they personally can remember how the death process is like. And after a person has seen for themselves <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span> the afterlife is, their fear of Death is gone, after they have again experienced the feeling of total bliss.</p>
              <p>What I'll like to share here about Heaven and Hell is that the afterlife is our real Home, and Earth is just a School. Once we've completed our learning in each lifetime, we return to Home. Home is very blissful, but Home is extremely positive, and does not allow negativity and negative energies to disrupt life there. So, if a person who has completed his lifetime has lots of negativity (eg. was a serial killer) and negative emotions, eg. fear, he will need to undergo Healing and cleansing first before being allowed to rejoin the community back Home.</p>
              <p>If people return Home being in a positive state of energy, it's very simple straightforward process.</p>
              <p>The thing is that if people have lots of negative karma to clear, or have many outstanding basic life lessons yet to be completed, generally, they won't be able to enjoy too much time back Home. Very often, they are sent packing very soon into another physical life time for them to continue their learning journey. When people have reached a certain spiritual advancement level, they have more 'say' in staying back Home or in the higher dimensions.</p>

              <p>As each of us evolve and grow spiritually (Universally), we will all reach a stage (however many lifetimes it takes) when we ourselves have access to the Universe and its infinite wisdom from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within ourselves</span> to know how to resolve our life issues, without depending on anyone else. When I help people to know/remember their past lives and to access their Higher Consciousness to resolve their current life issues, they are reaching within themselves and connecting with their true essence to receive the necessary information, not from an external party.</p>
              <p>To be totally dependent on an external person or party is effectively giving our own power away, and preventing our own spiritual growth.</p>
              <p>May all of you know and understand your true essence and gain the Universal wisdom from deep within yourselves! :)</p>
