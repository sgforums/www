              <p>The year 2012 is certainly not "end of the world". However, to the 
                          people who are going to perish in war and natural disasters, it may seem
                           like "end of the world" to them.</p>
                      <p>People who has scientific knowledge knows that 21 Dec 2012 marks the end and start of a precessional cycle. The three days event -&gt; 20~22 Dec 2012 is know as precession of the equinoxes, or precessional alignment. This is an electromagnetic  phenomenon, not a gravitational or rotational
                          one. However, be prepared that Earth's magnetic poles will shift radically during this period.</p>
                      <p>People who has spiritual knowledge knows that Mother Earth
                           will ascend to become a 4th density planet or the "New Earth". In order for Mother Earth to restore balance, a lot of purification and
                           cleansing will be required. Souls who has chose not to ascend together 
                          with Earth will find ways to exit Earth.</p>
                      <p>If you have neither 
                          scientific knowledge or spiritual knowledge, have no fear. Just do your 
                          meditation, get your healing and listen to what your dear <a href="http://www.livinglightuniverse.com/i_am.html">lightworker/helper</a> has to say. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>It takes some years for the change to complete, and the change had already started. But yes, we're transitioning from Age of Pisces to Age of Aquarius. We will see much more of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span></strong> (not hypocritical) democracy, freedom, humanitarianism, astrology (as in interests in the stars and Universe), nonconformity (ie. people will understand and live their true selves instead of following the crowd), philanthropy, humanity, etc.</p>

              <p>Excerpt from the full article:</p>
              <p><strong>Living Light Universe</strong> would like to say to all readers: the world will not end on 21 December 2012. So, does it mean that mankind should just treat 2012 as just another normal year, and continue to live as we have always done so for the past centuries?</p>
              <p>Though there will not be End of the World in 2012, but there will be massive unprecedented visible changes and events starting in 2012 and lasting till 2013 and beyond, that will impact almost all aspects of life on Earth.</p>
              <p>The Change/Shift has already begun, as far back as 1987 during the Harmonic Convergence, but the main outcomes of the change will only be seen and experienced by the majority of the world population in the years of 2012-2013.</p>
              <p>Our purpose of sharing this information is to inform, so that more people like you can be aware of what is actually happening, so would not be afraid, should you personally experience or hear/read of massive events that seem to be as described in ancient prophecies.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, the scariest thing that can happen in year 2012 is that people are living in fear.</p>
              <p>Why do people live in fear?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because of their beliefs in seperation. The belief in separation is the cause of fear.</p>
              <p>We
               become fearful when we believe that we are seperated from the rest of 
              the world and something outside ourselves can harm or hurt us or cause 
              us pain and suffering.</p>
              <p>In additional to fear of the outside 
              world, we feel that we are seperate from our own True-Self (Higher 
              self). We find it very difficult to listen to our own inner guidance and
               higher <span class="Body-Text-2-C">intuition. We fail to distinguish 
              between the ego and the soul, both which are constantly communicating to
               us through our physical and emotional bodies.</span></p>
              <p><em><strong>Thus, 
              we fear what is within ourselves. As a result, we become distrustful of 
              our own abillities to do what is for our highest good and to our best 
              interest.</strong></em></p>
              <p>The solution to fear?</p>
              <p>Do your meditation and/or healing and listen to what your dear lightworkers/helpers have to say.</p>
              <p>If you can go far enough in meditation, you will realise that 
              fear is ultimately an illusion, and as long as you believe in them, they
               are real for you.</p>
              <p>Before you can get rid of your fears, you must
               learn from them. Fear is not inherently good/bad. It is a learning 
              experience which is useful until you have mastered it. Once you have 
              recognised its illusionary nature, you no longer need fear and then its 
              time to lovingly accept it and release it.</p>

              <p>oic. people never get the full story and speculate 2012 as the year the earth will end lol.</p>
              <p>seriously how can the earth end in 2012 like that? earth is at least 6 billion years old. what are the odds the earth not surviving for another 1 billion years, 10 million years, 1 million years? what is the typical lifespan of a planet the size of earth? 2012 end? give me a break. 2000, 2012, 2100, 3000, 3010? thats nonsense.</p>
              <p>even if a large asteroid or comet the size of NY for example, were to crash into earth, earth will also survive, but humanity and land animals may not, just like dinosaurs were wiped out when an asteriod crashed onto earth. not all the people in the world may be wiped out on impact, some will survive, depending on the location, but then sunlight will be blocked out for years. plant life need sunlight to grow, so no plants means animals will die and this will impact on humans too. humans also cant grow crops due to no sunlight.</p>

              <p><br>If you wish to verify, you'll find your ways to do so. But as in all stuff disseminated on mass media from whichever country, in books, Internet, from various organisations, from various "experts" etc, one needs to feel within to tell if a piece of info is reliable or not. It's far more acccurate than depending on others. Info and pieces of knowledge, have their own vibrational frequency, which will attract their respective compatible receivers.</p>
              <p>Not all info is meant for everyone, at any one time. There is Divine Timing at work. Incompatible receivers will only get offended, angry or just make no sense of the info. That's the magic of vibrational frequencies, which fortunately, is rising fast in the world right now, so more info (which many people could not make sense of previously) will start to make sense along the way.</p>

              <p><br>Everyone in the Universe has a lifeplan, regardless of which planet the "life-form" is on. There is actually order in the Universe, though most people just treat their lives as a journey of random events. In reality, there are no random coincidences in Life, everything happens for a reason. But it's not necessary for most people to know every reason for everything in their entire lives, else it'll be info overload, and just prevents them from having the necessary life experiences.</p>

I could communicate with the UFO, people and also inside the Earth, there is very high civilisation existing.<br><br>Particularly the head of the "lybrarigan", East side of the Earth. Ar.. I so also commuincate with them.<br><br>And from all of these information, I had... I am convinced. 2012 Decemember 22 on... 3 days when this Earth are going into the fifth dimension.<br><br>There is a place called "Nuru", when we are passing through that place.<br><br>3 days 3 nights, we will not able to use the electricity.<br><br>That will be completely darkness day and night. <br><br>No Sun no stars a... no light at all. We are completely in dark, 3 days.<br><br>No mass media or no information are announced to these people on this planet.<br><br>Hidden government people know it. Just by themselves, they thought that they can be safe.<br><br>They tried to escape from this planet or they are digging the undergound city. <br><br>Under "alranta", Norway, Holland, Switzerland, Australia. About 10,000 people elite could be saved by living there.<br><br>I don't think they are safe anyway. We need to purify our spiritual condition, physically and spiritually.<br><br>I will tell you how to do it. It is very important.<br><br>Almighty God, the creator or the God itself is that light, and love and energy.<br><br>Part of that energy of the love, we have in our heart.<br><br>We can tell a lie to other people, but we cannot tell a lie to ourselves.<br><br>That... is the conscious conscience, I would call.<br><br>Each human has that beautiful part of the creator in our soul.<br><br>That will reincarnate. That is the eternal life we have inside.<br><br>That means, in order to purify our soul, every five years or so since we are born.<br><br>We can take a look at that conscious, how we behave, how we thought, how we talk about.<br><br>And all of these things can... clarified by looking at our lives every five years up until now.<br><br>This way, each time we find something... we did something harmful to the other people.<br><br>We can clarify and we can purify that. And each time we find it, our heart expand.<br><br>We can breathe it... very deeply and each time we have that experience.<br><br>All these darkness are going out of our heart but all these golden light is coming into our heart.<br><br>That way, we can see better and better. We still have some time until 2012 December(12) 22nd.<br><br>Physically, we can also purify our body. First of all we should never drink a canned juice or canned beer.<br><br>Aluminium is very very harmful to our body without knowing... we take all these poisonous food or drink.<br><br>So each of our body... we can take care of ourselves things like that. <br><br>And some kind of exercise is necessary and each day we can reflect our spirit how it is.<br><br>In essence, we human beings are light and love. Because part of Creator we have in our heart and that... <br><br>We incarnate by leaving our body here on Earth but spirit go... go on keep on living.<br><br>On this Earth, I could remember my life, several thousand years back on this planet.<br><br>And beside many many other part of the planet I lived. All this memories coming back and I could speak the language I have never learn even.<br><br>So phyiscally, I experienced the reincarnation theory is correct. <br><br>Well.. whoever listen to this conference, think as if people is saved.<br><br>We are so divided after 1913, the kind of people who believe in this kind concept the kind of people who don't.<br><br>They are spliting very very deeply. <br><br>And all these this side, the kind of people who don't understand this or not believing it. Or completely doubt spiritual conditions.<br><br>They will be born to the other planet just like this Earth... there is violence there is war. <br><br>They will be born to the other planet. So we are ready now to have a wonderful conference, very soon, very shortly.<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br>MUSIC VIDEO - AUDIOMACHINE - THE NEW EARTH<br><br>IF WHAT SHE IS SAYING IS TRUE OR NOT.<br><br>EITHER WAY. WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT.<br><br>IF IT IS TRUE. ITS NO ESCAPING IT.<br><br>SO WHY NOT TRY AND LOVE AGAIN. EVEN IF ITS TRUE OR NOT.<br><br>PEOPLE HAVE ALSO SAID IT WOULD BE IS 30 HOURS OF DARKNESS.<br><br>EVEN IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. AND MANY WILL SLEEP THROUGH IT.<br><br>DID THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS MAKE YOU FEEL FEAR?<br><br>IF SO. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO WORK ON.<br><br>TRUST YOUSELF AND CREATION.<br><br>LOVE YOURSELF AND OTHERS.<br><br>REMEMBER YOU'RE A SPIRIT EXPERIENCING A BODY, NOT A BODY EXPERIENCING A SPIRIT.<br><br>WAKE UP SO HUMANITY CAN UNITE AND IT STARTS WITH YOU.<br><br>WE ALL LIVE ON THIS PLANET TOGETHER.</p>
