              <p><br>   Do you really suspect for a second that Lady Gaga actually composed her music ? Choreographs her videos and dance routines ?  That she is a musical genius and dance genius ,choreographic genius etc... She is a puppet and she has sold her soul. It has come as an amazing surprise just how common it is and how those in search of fame and fortune get lured into it. One must however of course be careful of what one devulges if they know.</p>

              <p><br>   And what exactly does this 23 year old singer know about killing enemy soldiers ? She doesn't write her own songs, chroegraph her own dances, etc.... She is someone who will do ANYTHING !  Is this someone that Singaporeans or anybody should be following ? I was not exaggerating when I posted about her actually being a satanist or being controlled by satanists. If you don't believe me it's only because you don't know </p>

She is someone who will do ANYTHING !  Is this someone that Singaporeans or anybody should be following ? I was not exaggerating when I posted about her actually being a satanist or being controlled by satanists. If you don't believe me it's only because you don't know </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>yea, she is a satanist... some even say if u play her songs backward, u can hear satan voice... :0        but then, who r u to judge what one can listen to? well, some like to hear her music because they just like it, its like why u listen to what u like. why dun we criticise heavy metal then? all screaming, practically 90% screaming and ppl still worship them? its an individual's unique love for music to draw them to lady gaga's music, not who she is(which by the way does not hold satanist sentiments, the rumor waas found to be fake). if i told u ur favourite artist was a serial rapist, would u still listen to his songs? if yes, then its because u like the waay he sings, not the way he lives. its the same with many forumers here. her lifestyle may be bizzare to a huge extent, but as long as it does not affect her musicand how it sounds, why stop listening? that is the question many would then throw at ppl like you. can u answer that then? im not a fan of gaga by the way, in fact i hate her songs, but here im jus being impartial.   :)</p></div>
