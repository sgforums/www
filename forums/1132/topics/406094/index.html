              <p>Since forumers come to this forum, because of interest in paranormal sightings and activities, thought I'll just share a couple of tips (not all) of how you can improve your senses to non-physical entities.</p>
              <p>Reason why I said "non-physical entities (NPE)" is not all of them are ghosts, but their common attribute is they appear to have no physical bodies like us, when in our Earth Realm. Other than ghosts (lost souls), most of the NPEs that I've listed are of higher dimensions than our 3rd dimension, so they appear to have no physical bodies to us.</p>
              <p>The list of NPEs is really very long, so I'll just list the more common ones we know of, and their energy polarity.</p>
              <p>Ghosts / lost souls: spirits/souls of deceased who failed to cross over to the Spiritual Realm (Light), and are stuck in Earth Realm. They will look the way they did when they died, ie. will look sickly, with injuries, scars, can look gruesome esp. when they died in an accident. They can behave angry, confused, frustrated, negative. (NEGATIVE ENERGY)</p>
              <p>Spirits : spirits/souls of deceased who have already crossed over to the Spiritual Realm (Light), and come back to visit. They will appear very well (even for those who died terribly), and behave positively, as they have been healed back in the Light. (POSITIVE ENERGY)</p>
              <p>Nature Spirits / Elementals: Spirits of Nature, eg. trees, land, etc (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE ENERGY)</p>
              <p>Extraterrestrial Beings: Visitors from other worlds (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE ENERGY)</p>
              <p>Spiritual Guides: Everyone has a few Spiritual Guides, but we'll have 1 main Guide who guides us most often (POSITIVE ENERGY / VERY POSITIVE ENERGY - strength depends on their spiritual advancement, as some of them could be Ascended Masters)</p>
              <p>Higher Beings: Ascended Masters (people often call the more well-known Ascended Masters gods in their respective religions, though there are many non-famous ones too) and Angels (VERY POSITIVE ENERGY)</p>
              <p><strong>How to improve your senses to them (just a couple of tips):</strong></p>
              <p>People with animals have an early warning system, as animals can see/sense them extremely well, because their minds are not affected by the 'programming' and 'conditioning' that humans are subjected to in our world, which caused most people to lose their spiritual abilities.</p>
              <p>When you hear or see your pet or animal suddenly very excited or scared for no reason, and appears to keep looking at a certain direction in an area, where there's no one else there, there's usually a NPE there.</p>
              <p>For people who do not have enough positive energy in them, it's better to be on the safe side, and get out of the area, as negative NPEs can drain even more positive energy from them. People who are sensitive to energy, may be able to tell if the NPEs are positive or negative, even if they can't see them.</p>
              <p>For people with enough positive energy and wish to sense (not everyone can see) the NPEs, stand still in the area/room. Close your eyes. Relax your breathing pattern, till you're in a calm state. Look around the room with your "mind's eye", ie. view the room/area with your eyes closed. With practice, and assuming your spiritual abilities are not totally blocked, you'll be able to 'see' shapes/colours, movements and perhaps even the actual form of the NPEs! People who can physically see NPEs, can of course open their eyes to see, but still they'll not be able to see every NPE, all the time.</p>
              <p>Besides trying to see with your mind's eye, while standing still, use your body to feel your surroundings. You may be able to feel movements or presence of the NPEs.  </p>
              <p>Certain religious perspectives view this as pure rubbish from your brain's thinking/imagination/delusion. But people who are able to overcome 'negative programming' and unlock their spiritual abilities, will be able to do things that others thought it's impossible.</p>
              <p>Have fun, guys! But please don't do dangerous stunts! Negative NPEs should be avoided (not feared), unless you know how to handle them. :)</p>
              <p>As for positive NPEs, they'll be more than happy that you are finally able to sense and acknowledge them!</p>

              <p>When in doubt, don't be over-friendly with NPEs at first. Strong Negative NPEs can be quite troublesome. Possession of people's physical bodies can also happen, when encountering Negative NPEs. Positive NPEs will not possess another body, except for experienced trance channelers, who have given them permission.</p>
              <p>Unless you have strong enough spiritual strength and abilities, please don't do crazy and dangerous stuff during any encounters. At no time should you invite them, or allow them permission to enter your body.</p>
              <p>As for spiritual abilities, there are many self-proclaimed "Masters" all over the world happily collecting good money or gaining attention to impart their 'powerful spiritual skills' to people. In real-life encounters with strong Negative NPEs, these self-proclaimed "Masters" will be the first to flee the scene. People need to be discerning when dealing with matters of spirituality and 'supernatural'. The Universe is far more complex than what most people can possibly imagine; the unseen world is far deeper than our visible world. :)</p>

              <p>For those interested to understand better about lost souls (ghosts), you may like to watch the movie "Sixth Sense" starring Bruce Willis. It's quite an old show, but I feel it's the most realistic Hollywood movie about ghosts. The only part of the movie that I felt was exaggerated for the sake of entertainment is that there are so many lost souls who are not related and all died of various gruesome manners, and they happen to all appear in the same house!</p>

              <p>The invisible worlds (higher dimensional worlds) are far deeper and more complex than the visible 3D world that people can see in general. And this huge limitation of Man has resulted in many people thinking they are the supreme beings in the Universe, when in reality, Man are really among the most primitive in terms of abilities, knowledge, technology, experience and Consciousness. But this is all going to change soon, and everyone who is ready is given the opportunity to advance in their evolution in the not-too-distant future.</p>
