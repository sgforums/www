              <p>There is a critical Universal project called "Disclosure Project" that is currently ongoing to help prepare populations worldwide for what needs to happen soon in this lifetime: official recognition of highly intelligent, advanced and positive extraterrestrial Universal Beings and cooperation with them in a Galactic arrangement.</p>
              <p>Throughout modern history, this topic about extraterrestrials, ETs, aliens and UFOs has intentionally been made a joke or kept extremely well-hidden from the public by various organisations and the media, because of very sensitive political and societal reasons, resulting from their fear that it would change the status quo of their authority and society as a whole.</p>
              <p>Many people might be asking: even if this is true, how is this relevant to the average person, whose lives revolve around working to earn a living, studying for exams, taking care of family and children, etc? The relevance is: Earth is currently undergoing massive and unprecedented changes as part of "The Shift", and almost every aspect of her will be affected, especially the environment. What jobs and food will we be talking about when Earth becomes a total mess and danger everywhere?</p>
              <p>Humans, with our current level of technology and Consciousness, will not be able to cope with the upcoming Earth changes on our own. These positive Galactic Beings have throughout Earth's existence (far beyond what has been recorded) been returning time and again to help the human race at critical points. We are now entering another critical point of Earth's lifespan.</p>
              <p>We live in an extremely complex Universe, where much of what really goes on in our Universe is still not understood by the general population. 2012 is the year that the world will start to experience massive changes, for humans to learn, grow and advance further as a race. Humans are no longer like young children who need to be kept indoors to protect them from the real world out there. It is finally time for the human race to mature, open their doors and be introduced to their Galactic neighbours and friends living all around them.</p>
              <p>As part of Earth's current positive transformational process, it will become very much easier for people worldwide to have access to Universal information that has been protected/distorted historically. Many highly reputable and credible people, from government agencies, intelligence agencies (eg. CIA), military, police, air traffic controllers, will be coming out in the public to disclose their real-life information and experience. In the past, most of them were prevented from revealing what they know, but we are now starting a new era of evolution and growth.</p>
              <p>Please see below for some of the Disclosure events:</p>

              <p>Actually, many people currently on Earth had past lives as extraterrestrials on other planets, but most of them have forgotten. Generally, people who feel a strong liking for sci-fi stories, movies, graphics, games, etc, and/or feel very strongly that they don't like the kind of life that everyone around them is living, and/or people who often have dreams of places/worlds that don't appear like Earth are quite likely to have spent at least some lifetimes on planets outside Earth.</p>
              <p>When Disclosure and First Contact happen in the near future, humans would be first introduced to humanoid extraterrestrials, to help them feel at ease. It also serves to help people question, wonder and find out more details about their connections with them, since they appear just as human as Earth humans. :)</p>

              <p>Some of the best sightings of extraterrestrial craft in August 2012:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFfzGV9g-N0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFfzGV9g-N0</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Expect to have more and more of such sightings around the world. It is very unlikely to happen in Singapore as our airspace is too congested for them to appear without causing risks to the many airplanes using our airspace. But if you are travelling, you may well have the opportunity to see the flying craft yourself.</p>

              <p>I'll like to share a message from the Arcturians (from the higher 7th dimension as compared to Earth's 3rd dimension) who have recently given me the following info:</p>
              <p>Our Sun is currently "unstable", and experiencing much changes. The effects on people on Earth during this period are mostly on the following 3 areas of our body, for the general population, in varying degrees:</p>
              <p>Eyes: Our eyes will undergo changes that will allow more and more people to see other dimensional Beings. Our eyes will become much more sensitive to light, and it may cause some people to feel more discomfort being in the outdoors.</p>
              <p>Throat: Expect more discomfort in the throat area, especially for people who are not speaking out their true feelings.</p>
              <p>Skin: Rashes and other skin conditions like "skin breakages" will be more common, as a reaction to the new energies from the Sun.</p>

              <p>Are this knowledge of extra terrestial beings secret knowledge, like dark magic or something like that and if you people know about all this, can I ask is it that Nasa could have seen life in space but does not tell us. Could the planet nibiru be the new jerusalem where there are inhabitants in it. According to the internet, the planet nibiru will fly past earth, but not crashing into earth, the gravity of nibiru will mess up earth's gravity and many natural disasters will happen. Could nibiru support life and in nibiru, they contain species, whether human-like or not. Or are all this just conspiracies?</p>

              <p>By now, many people would know that mainstream media in most, if not all countries, is not neutral. If that is the only source where people learn about the true reality of our world, sad to say, it is not the full picture. As for how much truth NASA and other space agencies have shared with the public, you can search online for retired astronauts' testimonies about their personal sightings of other worldly craft and structures. Why the cover ups? Because many world leaders are afraid of losing their control over their people, when enough people know about the far more technically and spiritually advanced Beings who are helping the people and Earth.</p>
              <p>There are many parallel timelines that control reality in the Universe. What happens to each person's reality depends on which timeline he/she chooses, often subconsciously. Unless one has experience with multidimensional energies, they won't even know that their reality has changed because of the timeline they are on is different.</p>
              <p>The reality of huge object from space crashing onto Earth is part of an old outdated timeline, which is unlikely to happen now, because many events have already changed regarding Earth's reality. Yes, there will be major disasters, but not of extinction level in the next few years ahead, but they would be mostly earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, etc.</p>
              <p>What is much more important for people of the world to learn and find out quickly is that the truth of Earth and Universe is ready for them to know, if they are willing to open their minds and hearts. It's time for people to find out if they are ready to progress and evolve.</p>

              <p>I've read about many conspiracy theories of the end of the world, of what that will happen, but how do you actually leave your body behind and travel into the spiritual realm to find out. And I suppose that spirits are non-matter and of no physical shape nor existence as energy. I've read about some people claiming that an angel had brought them into the spiritual realm to take a look at heaven and the fallen angels.</p>
              <p>Could you find out whether the bible has mentioned the end of the world?</p>
              <p>Whether aliens are actually the people who had came to earth long ago and make people worship them. And from my view, I think aliens could be spirits with no physical body, and could planet nibiru be the New Jerusalem and the aliens residing in it be Army of God which is mentioned to come to earth?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Then comes the end, when He delivers the Kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet." (1 Corinthians 15:24-25 RSV)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">"Then I saw a great white throne and Him Who sat upon it; from His presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead in them, and all were judged by what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire</span><span style="color: #000080; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">. This is the second death, the lake of fire; and if any one's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire." (Revelation 20:11-15 RSV)</span> </p>
              <p>And as you said <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> '</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">It's time for people to find out if they are ready to progress and evolve.'   </span>The bible say that the earth will be set on fire, which I perceive it as setting humans on fire, burning evil and physical desires, changing and evolving into a spiritual being. Which could also mean that humans lose their physical form, changing into non-matter as fire would combust chemical potential energy(in matter) into heat energy(non-matter but exist in matter). Giving it a comparison that charcoals(humans) will be burnt, turning into ashes(evil and physical desires) and heat(spiritual essence).                                                                                      </p>
              <p>  <span style="color: #000080; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">"But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with The Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow about His promise as some count slowness, but is forbearing toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance."</span></p>
              <p style="color: #000080; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">"But the day of The Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up."</p>
              <p style="color: #000080; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">"Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be kindled and dissolved, and the elements will melt with fire! But according to His promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. (2 Peter 3:3-13 RSV)</p>
