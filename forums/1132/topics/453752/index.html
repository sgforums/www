              <p>I wish that there's no after-life. However, the hard truth is there's after-life. Reincarnation is as natural as death. No need to believe in death to let it happen, same as reincarnation, believe in reincarnation or not, it will just happen to everyone naturally. That's law of nature. The ultimate aim of every Buddhists is to relieve ourselves from reincarnation. Watch the following video clip on reincarnation. There are many real cases, this is just one of them.</p>

              <p>People with 3rd eye will tell you whether there's life after death. According to them, there's life after death. I remember last year, one DJ invited a friend who has 3rd eye to talk about ghost realm.</p>

              <p>To be true, it is certainly not as simple as after death, I do not exist anymore.</p>
              <p>Regardless
               whether you believe it or not, for most souls who are still within the 
              wheel of reincarnation (3rd &amp; 4th density only), they will continue 
              to incarnate <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as many times as they need</span> in order to learn their lessons.</p>
              <p>The
               decision to incarnate in the first place is due to the desire to learn 
              everything about Creation. Not because you have sinned or have karma to 
              balance.</p>
              <p>I will give two possible example here:</p>
              <p>1) After physical 
              death, the physical body will decay and return to dust. The soul will 
              leave the body and wander in a lost and confuse state in the Astral 
              realm (4th dimension) until its next incarnation. This "underworld or hell" scenario should be avoided.</p>
              <p>2)
               Same phyiscal death as above. The soul will leave the body, ascend to 
              the Spiritual realm (6th or 7th dimension), do some evaluation and 
              decides its next incarnation. This "heaven" scenario is quite common and
               you will get to meet your soul family members here.</p>
              <p>There are other possibilities other than the two stated above but
               you can assume 99% of humanity will go through the either of the two 
              scenario stated above after physical death.</p>

              <p>Many people have the notion that when they die they would like to meet their mother, father, etc.</p>
              <p>But their mother, father are only related here on earth by their genes. These remain on earth.</p>
              <p>Over there, (where ever that is), every entity is equal. Your parents only germinated your body, not your soul or spirit. Therefore one spirit cannot go to another spirit and call "Mother" or "Father".</p>
              <p>And perhaps</p>
              <p>3) All spirit will return to its origin merging into one forming an ever expanding pool of knowledge. Maybe the bad will be discarded, but then what can be deemed bad to infinite knowledge.</p>

              <p>Actually, it's only on Earth that different people perceive life after death differently, because of their respective beliefs. When it's everyone's turn to leave this world, they'll all go through the same process, regardless of their beliefs. Reincarnation is not a Buddhist or Taoist thing, but a Universal process. It's through reincarnation that people learn to be better people, either by correcting past life mistakes and/or to learn new life lessons.</p>

              <p>The near-death article is interesting and i think it is real... as i can resonate with what it being described. However, i will like to share my understanding on certain aspects.</p>
              <p>What is not articulated clearly is that all that is happening is really like a dream. He mention that the Universe is like God's Dream and that God live through us.  This dream-like is luminous and non-dual... there is no subject-object division. To put in a way that is not precise but for explanatory purpose ..... The experience is of pure awareness/consciousness within pure awareness. That means to say... God's dream is dreaming within God. The appearances is awareness. In order to achieve that, the Universe is really just a hologram ...or holographic projection. When an action is carried out... this one action vibrates across the entire holographic/interpenetrating 'space'.</p>
              <p>In the article, he mention the void and that it is full. Because space, time, location, distances are interpreted experiences (aka illusions), everything is really occurring within a framework of no-distance, no-location, presentness. Everything is all pervading, interpenetrating and without solidity. The void is full of everything. Emptiness is form... form is emptiness.</p>
              <p>When (in the article) the God say I don't care about which religion one is in... it is an understatement. IMO, Pure awareness doesn't care about anything !!! .... It is desire/series of dynamics that 'cause' the universe to appear as many things, beings and object. They are really no one being or soul.. all is the experience of Pure consciousness in 'isolated' angle of experiences. Each isolated experience eventually develop a sense of self.... which in actual fact there is no-self. True pure awareness/consciousness/God whatever you want to call have no sense of self. The sense of self is developed due to isolated angle of experiences believing in their own individuality and becomes attached to what that appears as external experiences. </p>
              <p>The 'higher self' or oversoul described is a collection of experience. By human 'sense of self' comparision, the higher self is exalted. My experience of this higher self is that it is not concerned about the eventual death of individual incarnation. Rather it is more concern about resolution. </p>
              <p>He also mentioned that the Universe comes and go. My understanding is that by the end of a universe cycle every being 'should have' become fully realised/enlightened. However, due to fundamental ignorance (residual karmic propensities)... universe restarts and the whole subject-object illusion comes in play again.</p>
              <p>This is just my understanding and experience only. I think  it is better than we find out for ourself than to listen to fully believe other's words.</p>

              <p>The best word that I will use to describe the near-death article is that it is "accurate".</p>
              <p>For
                       me, I do not have any direct experience above the 7th dimension, the 
                      soul plane. Thus so I will still percieve everyone has a "self" or a 
                      sense of self instead of "no-self" or "no soul".</p>
              <p>However, I do 
                      know that the soul level (7th Density) is the last level of 
                      individuality (individual soul). From 8 to 12 dimension, is no longer 
                      meaningful to use words such as "self" or "no-self". For example, the 
                      oversoul level (8D) is a collection of souls with collective 
                      consiousness. Examples of 8D beings overseeing Earth Changes will be 
                      Lord Sananda and Maitreya so you may contact them if you want to verify 
                      certain spiritual topics.</p>
              <p>To simpo_:</p>
              <p>I apologise, my misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>My advice, as a "little self", one should humbly serves the "higher self". Full Stop.</p>

              <p>I would like to present here something that all of you would not disagree. Just empty your thoughts and read.............If you don't agree then think and live the way you like.</p>
              <p>The year is 1200 A.D. People are living in way that a person in 2012 would never imagine. The people at that time did not have electricity, no cooling machines, no wasshing machines, no telephone. They were not blessed with the pompous world of Television,  mobile phone and computer. All these gadgets are an inevitable part of our life. There is no life without these things......although there are still some parts of the world where tehse things are not known.</p>
              <p>Let say,a man in 1200 A.D suddenly claims that there will be a time where you can save your memories such as parties, get-together, marriage ceremonies, wars on a device (I am talking about hardrive, memory cards).......People must have mocked on him and consider him an insane person...Well it is natural to behave in such a manner. My dear fellows human beings never accept something that is beyond their imagination. Can you think of aeroplanes...i am not talking about jet-planes....i am talking about simple aeroplane which can get anywhere in the world in few hours.</p>
              <p>Take more.......</p>
              <p> People in 1200 A.D at the war used the weapons that are not considered worthy to be discussed today. Now in 2012 we hear satellite-guided missiles bombarding a aprticular area of a country without being a single man died from the attacking country. A button will do the damage.......It will be highly unwise from a person in 1200 A.D to believe that wars can be win without using a single soldier....It will be more appropriate to say people at that time would never thought of this idea just like a man in 2012 will be living without electricity, TV, mobile phones, cars.</p>

              <p>It translates to me as:</p>
              <p>1. You see "this higher self" as a seperate "thing" that does
                                              not know what you know. A sense of separation from the whole.

              <p>2. You have a sense of self since you still see your higher self
                                              as "this higher self" which is an "isolated experience". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>3. Your higher self sees you as a problem that requires
                                              resolution. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Your idea is that one will not be a self only when he/she ascend high enough. This is not what i am conveying.  This is a wrong assumption.</p>
              <p>'No-self' is not about someone having a self then the self dissappear. Rather, it is an original truth of how things really are. .. that is... things are without self-nature.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, this realisation of no-self is required for 'stopping' the rebirth cycle.</p>
              <p>This realisation of no-self does not mean that you suddenly have no sense-of-self completely. The complete dissolving of sense-of-self is a very gradually process that can take up to a maximum of 7 lifetimes. </p>
              <p>It is like... one initially discover the truth of things.... but the momentums of life are still filled with the dynamics build up by false assumptions. Slowly and gradually, one dismantles the false to re-establish the way things really are.</p>
