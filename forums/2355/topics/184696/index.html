One way you can try to overcome is to eat in small proportions, but more meals. Don't eat too much junk food as one grows older, metabolism rate will decrease. This explains why one can be so thin in their younger days, yet overweight when they are older. You should exercise regularly too. Muscles can weigh a lot, so it will help to add some weight.<br><br>If your father is thin, you probably inherited his genes as well. There's no point blaming your parents' genes. You have to accept that this is your genes.</div>
